Abraham Lincoln
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:In the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of greatgratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests.You will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies ofthe times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended withprofound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.A disloyal portion of the American people have during the whole yearbeen engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nationwhich endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespectabroad, and one party, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invokeforeign intervention.Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist thecounsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, althoughmeasures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunateand injurious to those adopting them.The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin ofour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invokedabroad have received less patronage and encouragement than theyprobably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents haveseemed to assume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding allmoral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishlyfor the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especially theacquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seentheir way to their object more directly or clearly through thedestruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we coulddare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higherprinciple than this, I am quite sure a sound argument could be made toshow them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily byaiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it.The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreignnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is theembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably sawfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign asour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive thatthe effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that onestrong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive,valuable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken intohostile fragments.It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states,because, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrityof our country and the stability of our Government mainly depend notupon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence ofthe American people. The correspondence itself, with the usualreservations, is herewith submitted.I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence andliberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation andwith firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state,foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommendthat adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the publicdefenses on every side. While under this general recommendationprovision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, Ialso in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our greatlakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots ofarms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all atwell selected points upon these, would be of great importance to thenational defense and preservation. I ask attention to the views of theSecretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same generalsubject.  I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of eastTennessee and western North Carolina should be connected with Kentuckyand other faithful parts of the Union by railroad. I thereforerecommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for theconstruction of such road as speedily as possible. Kentucky no doubtwill cooperate, and through her legislature make the most judiciousselection of a line. The northern terminus must connect with someexisting railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington orNicholasville to the Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennesseeline, in the direction of Knoxville, or on some still different line,can easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Governmentcooperating, the work can be completed in a very short time, and whendone it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also avaluable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, andhaving no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will besubmitted to the Senate for their consideration.Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers toadopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we haveremoved all obstructions from the way of this humane reform except suchas are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence.I invite your attention to the correspondence between Her BritannicMajesty\'s minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary ofState relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in Junelast by the United States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed breachof the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obviousmisapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we shouldcommit no belligerent act not rounded in strict right as sanctioned bypublic law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy thereasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message toCongress in December last in regard to the disposition of the surpluswhich will probably remain after satisfying the claims of Americancitizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissionersunder the act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not bedeemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I wouldsuggest that authority be given for investing the principal, over theproceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view tothe satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens againstChina as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of ourextensive trade with that Empire.By the act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the Presidentto instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselvesagainst and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in asingle instance only. For the more effectual protection of ourextensive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, itseems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commandersof sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make ofUnited States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts nowestablished by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in theevent that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholdingour recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti andLiberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate anovel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, Isubmit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation formaintaining a charge d\'affaires near each of those new States. It doesnot admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might besecured by favorable treaties with them.The operations of the Treasury during the period which has elapsedsince your adjournment have been conducted with signal success. Thepatriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the Governmentthe large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the nationalloan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whoseconfidence in their country\'s faith and zeal for their country\'sdeliverance from present peril have induced them to contribute to thesupport of the Government the whole of their limited acquisitions. Thisfact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energyin action.The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial yearending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900.27, and theexpenditures for the same period, including payments on account of thepublic debt, were $84,578,834.47, leaving a balance in the Treasury onthe 1st of July of 52,257,065.80. For the first quarter of thefinancial year ending on the 30th of September, 1861, the receipts fromall sources, including the balance of the 1st of July, were$102,532,509.27, and the expenses $98,239,733.09, leaving a balance onthe 1st of October, 1861, of $4,292,776.18.Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for thefinancial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means formeeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congressby the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that theexpenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond theresources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotismwhich has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain ittill peace and union shall again bless the land.I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War forinformation respecting the numerical strength of the Army and forrecommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and thewell being of the various branches of the service intrusted to hiscare. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people hasproved equal to the occasion, and that the number of troops tenderedgreatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into thefield.I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which makeallusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by ourtroops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire Army.The recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militiaupon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the futuresafety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention ofCongress.The large addition to the Regular Army, in connection with thedefection that has so considerably diminished the number of itsofficers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation forincreasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the MilitaryAcademy.By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplainsfor hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to mynotice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy ofwhich, properly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons,and at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule,containing also the form of the letter marked A, and herewithtransmitted.These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated atthe times respectively stated in the schedule, and have laboredfaithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they becompensated at the same rate as chaplains in the Army. I furthersuggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve athospitals, as well as with regiments.The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail theoperations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy whichhave characterized its administration, and the results of measures toincrease its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions, byconstruction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has beencreated and brought into service since our difficulties commenced.Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than everbefore assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performeddeeds which have increased our naval renown.I would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretaryfor a more perfect organization of the Navy by introducing additionalgrades in the service.The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and thesuggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, ifadopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, andincrease the efficiency of the Navy.There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court two by thedecease of Justices Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation ofJustice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fillthese vacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoingjudges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that ifsuccessors were appointed in the same localities they could not nowserve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men thereprobably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, evenhere, upon the Supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all theappointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to theSouth on the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer tothe North one which has heretofore been in the South would not, withreference to territory and population, be unjust.During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean hiscircuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one judge togive the courts therein more than a nominal attendance rising inpopulation from 1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.Besides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicialsystem. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that allthe States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended bySupreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts.Nor can this well be remedied without a change in the system, becausethe adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodationof all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a courtaltogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil,if it be one, will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuitcourts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should bedenied them; if not useful, no State should have them. Let them beprovided for all or abolished as to all.Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be animprovement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be ofconvenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country bedivided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to servein a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independentcircuit judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let theSupreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judgesprovided for all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuitcourts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to thedistrict courts and an independent Supreme Court.I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the presentcondition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be ableto find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils whichconstantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration ofthem. Since the organization of the Government Congress has enactedsome 5,000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6,000closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes. Many ofthese acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, sothat their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflictwith each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficultfor even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what thestatute law really is.It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made asplain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small acompass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will ofthe Legislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well donewould, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it isto assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lastingbenefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible andintelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests andtheir duties.I am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts ofCongress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might berevised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at mosttwo volumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfullyrecommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestionbe approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem mostproper for the attainment of the end proposed.One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is theentire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means ofadministering civil justice by the officers and in the forms ofexisting law. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all theinsurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession ofparts of those States the practical evil becomes more apparent. Thereare no courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other States mayapply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens ofthe insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constitutingsuch claims. Some have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due inlarge part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who areeven now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patrioticduty to support the Government.Under these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establishby military power courts to administer summary justice in such cases Ihave thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that theend proposed the collection of the debts was just and right initself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure ofnecessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress,I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I referthe whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devisedfor the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgentStates and Territories as may be under the control of this Government,whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the powerof our arms; this, however, not to be a permanent institution, but atemporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts canbe reestablished in peace.It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, ifpossible, for the adjustment of claims against the Government,especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. Itis as much the duty of Government to render prompt justice againstitself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same betweenprivate individuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims intheir nature belong to the judicial department. Besides, it is apparentthat the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged forsome time to come with great national questions. It was intended by theorganization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch ofbusiness from the halls of Congress: but while the court has proved tobe an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in great degreefails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to makeits judgments final.Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, Icommend to your careful consideration whether this power of makingjudgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving theright of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with suchother provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General, the followingbeing a summary statement of the condition of the Department:The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30,1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for thetransportation of "free mail matter," was $9,049,296.40, being about 2per cent less than the revenue for 1860.The expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8per cent as compared with those of the previous year and leaving anexcess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of$4,557,462.71.The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at anincrease of 4 per cent on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to whichshould be added the earnings of the Department in carrying free matter,viz, $700,000, making $9,383,000.The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leavingan estimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the Treasuryin addition to the permanent appropriation.The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of thisDistrict across the Potomac River at the time of establishing thecapital here was eminently wise, and consequently that therelinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State ofVirginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration theexpediency of regaining that part of the District and the restorationof the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the Stateof Virginia.The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanyingdocuments, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the publicbusiness pertaining to that Department. The depressing influences ofthe insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of thePatent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales ofpublic lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of ourland system only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspendedin the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of thecountry and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor tomilitary service have obstructed settlements in the new States andTerritories of the Northwest.The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about$100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessaryto make it self sustaining.The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by theinsurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon thecasualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reasonto believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receiptof the bounty of the Government are in the ranks of the insurgent armyor giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior hasdirected a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such personsupon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorizethat officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from thepension rolls.The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have beengreatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southernsuperintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south ofKansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. Theagents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for thissuperintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the mostof those who were in office before that time have espoused theinsurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents byvirtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated inthe public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized asa military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents.Although the Government has no official information upon this subject,letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs byseveral prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to theUnited States and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troopsto protect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of thecountry by the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease allhostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to theGovernment.Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not adepartment nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in theGovernment. While it is fortunate that this great interest is soindependent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted morefrom the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whethersomething more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage.Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce,and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practicalvalue to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, Iventure the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau mightprofitably be organized.The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slavetrade has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is asubject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for thesuppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended withunusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade havebeen seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the tradeand one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convictedand subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain,taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convictedof the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of whichis death.The Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the lastCongress, have been organized, and civil administration has beeninaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it isconsidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some ofthese new countries when the Federal officers arrived there.The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the securityand protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless inviteto them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business ofthe country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of thelegislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of thepeople of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States hasbeen upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in thefuture. I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened andgenerous care of Congress.I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests ofthe District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of muchsuffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have norepresentative in Congress that body should not overlook their justclaims upon the Government.At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing thePresident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation ofthe industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of theindustry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. Iregret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to thissubject a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensivelyand intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world.Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or systemhas been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled "An act toconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes," approved August6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and serviceof certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of thelatter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States andmust be provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossiblethat some of the States will pass similar enactments for their ownbenefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the sameclass will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommendthat Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States,according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of directtaxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such Statesrespectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the GeneralGovernment, be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps betaken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if theother shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in aclimate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whetherthe free colored people already in the United States could not, so faras individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring ofterritory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to beexpended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced theacquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question ofconstitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. Thepower was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in thepurchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of greatexpediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiringterritory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects thatobject, for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room forwhite men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed theimportance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercialgrounds than on providing room for population.On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money withthe acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount toabsolute necessity that without which the Government itself can not beperpetuated?The war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted forsuppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that theinevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into aviolent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore inevery case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Unionprominent as the primary object of the contest on our pan, leaving allquestions which are not of vital military importance to the moredeliberate action of the Legislature.In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade ofthe ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force byproclamation the law of Congress enacted .at the late session forclosing those ports.So also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligationsof law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congressto confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new lawupon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be dulyconsidered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensablemeans must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine thatradical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as thedisloyal, are indispensable.The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and themessage to Congress at the late special session were both mainlydevoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection andconsequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to orfrom the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in thosedocuments.The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at theassault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurredsince may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then ismuch better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of eventsis plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed astrong support from north of Mason and Dixon\'s line, and the friends ofthe Union were not free from apprehension on the point. This, however,was soon settled definitely, and on the right side. South of the linenoble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was madeto seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges wereburned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many daysat one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over hersoil to the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired andopen to the Government; she already gives seven regiments to the causeof the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regularelection, have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a largeraggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or anyquestion. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and,I think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri iscomparatively quiet, and, I believe, can not again be overrun by theinsurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, andMissouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first,have now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for theUnion, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of thatnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are inarms against us. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, wintercloses on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters oftheir own country.An insurgent force of about 1,500, for months dominating the narrowpeninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton,and known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguousparts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there haverenewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the oldflag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or eastof the Chesapeake.Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on thesouthern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island (near Savannah),and Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popularmovements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancingsteadily and certainly southward.Since your last adjournment Lieutenant General Scott has retired fromthe head of the Army. During his long life the nation has not beenunmindful of his merit; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably,and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in ourhistory, when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforwardcontinually, I can not but think we are still his debtors. I submit,therefore, for your consideration what further mark of recognition isdue to him, and to ourselves as a grateful people.With the retirement of General Scott came the Executive duty ofappointing in his stead a General in Chief of the Army. It is afortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there,so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person tobe selected. The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment infavor of General McClellan for the position, and in this the nationseemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of GeneralMcClellan is therefore in considerable degree the selection of thecountry as well as of the Executive, and hence there is better reasonto hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thusby fair implication promised, and without which he can not with so fullefficiency serve the country.It has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, andthe saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is betterdirected by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior onesat variance and cross purposes with each other.And the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged canhave none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choiceof means. In a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink,and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many willdirect and no single mind can be allowed to control.It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if notexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government therights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the mostgrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in thegeneral tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find theabridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to thepeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officersexcept the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments toprove that large control of the people in government is the source ofall political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as apossible refuge from the power of the people.In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omitraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should bemade in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with itsconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a briefattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with,if not above, labor in the structure of government. It is assumed thatlabor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody laborsunless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induceshim to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is bestthat capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by theirown consent, or buy them and drive them to it without their consent.Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborersare either hired laborers or what we call slaves. And further, it isassumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that conditionfor life.Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, noris there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in thecondition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and allinferences from them are groundless.Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruitof labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higherconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy ofprotection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, andprobably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producingmutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor ofcommunity exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and thatfew avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy anotherfew to labor for them. A large majority belong to neitherclass neither work for others nor have others working for them. Inmost of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of allcolors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a largemajority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families wives,sons, and daughters work for themselves on their farms, in theirhouses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, andasking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers orslaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number ofpersons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor withtheir own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but thisis only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated isdisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.Again, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any suchthing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back intheir lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in theworld labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy toolsor land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, andat length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just andgenerous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hopeto all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of conditionto all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toilup from poverty; none less inclined to take or touch aught which theyhave not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a politicalpower which they already possess, and which if surrendered will surelybe used to close the door of advancement against such as they and tofix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall belost.From the first taking of our national census to the last are seventyyears, and we find our population at the end of the period eight timesas great as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other thingswhich men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at oneview what the popular principle, applied to Government through themachinery, of the States and the Union, has produced in a given time,and also what if firmly maintained it promises for the future. Thereare already among us those who if the Union be preserved will live tosee it contain 250,000,000. The struggle of to day is not altogetherfor to day; it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providenceall the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task whichevents have devolved upon us.
Abraham Lincoln
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountifulharvests has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to blessus with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the bestlight He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way allwill yet be well.The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken placeduring the last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance witha request to that effect made by the House of Representatives near theclose of the last session of Congress. If the condition of ourrelations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usuallybeen at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nationso unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended. Inthe month of June last there were some grounds to expect that themaritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties sounwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as abelligerent would soon recede from that position, which has proved onlyless injurious to themselves than to our own country. But the temporaryreverses which afterwards befell the national arms, and which wereexaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayedthat act of simple justice.The civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment theoccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarilydisturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperityof the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has beensteadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has atthe same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which haveproduced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In thisunusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversybetween foreign states and between parties or factions in such states.We have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. Butwe have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management ofits own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated byforeign nations with reference less to its own merits than to itssupposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting tothose nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of thisGovernment, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treatywith Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been putinto operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is anoccasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it onthe part of Her Majesty\'s Government has been marked with a jealousrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of theirmoral and loyal citizens.The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues hasbeen carried into full effect under the act of Congress for thatpurpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be establishedand vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity likethe present without committing occasional mistakes and inflictingunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civilwar occurring in a country, where foreigners reside and carry on tradeunder treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of theviolation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excitemisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations betweennations which have a common interest in preserving peace andfriendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possibleheard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendlypowers. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number ofdoubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to agree with thegovernments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are,moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizenssuffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nationswhich the governments of those states are not at once prepared toredress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interestedmutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. Thisproposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, toSpain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, buthas not yet been formally adopted.I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the ownersof the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May,1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charlestonfrom leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilegehad shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directedthe Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to becommunicated to the proper committees.Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of Africandescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization aswas contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home andabroad some from interested motives, others upon patrioticconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropicsentiments have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,several of the Spanish American Republics have protested against thesending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under thesecircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any statewithout first obtaining the consent of its government, with anagreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all therights of freemen; and I have at the same time offered to the severalStates situated within the Tropics, or having colonies there, tonegotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate,to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to theirrespective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, andhumane. Liberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to whichcolonists of African descent from here could go with certainty of beingreceived and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such personscontemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to thosecountries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interestdemands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this respect isimproving, and that ere long there will be an augmented andconsiderable migration to both these countries from the United States.The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan ofTurkey has been carried into execution.A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to theSenate\'s consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is nowpending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of thenational commerce is expected to result from these measures. Ourrelations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia,Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the otherEuropean States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations alsocontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.During the last year there has not only been no change of our previousrelations with the independent States of our own continent, but morefriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to beentertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are sointimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies toMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile. Thecommission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada closedits session without having audited and passed upon all the claims whichwere submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive theconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The jointcommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica hascompleted its labors and submitted its report. I have favored theproject for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantictelegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from SanFrancisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which isbeing extended across the Russian Empire. The Territories of the UnitedStates, with unimportant exceptions have remained undisturbed by thecivil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity asjustifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a conditionto be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into theFederal Union.The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to bedeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction wouldhave a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminishthe burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious considerationwhether some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not beadopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effectiveis a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territorieswith a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreigncountries results which can not fail to be auspicious.The condition of the finances will claim your most diligentconsideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and navaloperations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hithertobeen met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similarcircumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. Thecontinuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements madenecessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your bestreflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenuewithout injury to business and with the least possible burdens uponlabor.The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after thecommencement of your last session made large issues of United Statesnotes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops andthe satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so wellprovided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing thereceivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and makingthem a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universalcurrency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, thelong felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to thepeople immense sums in discounts and exchanges.A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatiblewith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and toreduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be aleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certainconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best andsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether acirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficientlylarge for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, andsafely maintained.Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for thepublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniformcurrency secured?I know of none which promises so certain results and is at the sametime so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations,under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. Tosuch associations the Government might furnish circulating notes, onthe security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. Thesenotes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniformin appearance and security and convertible always into coin, would atonce protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency andfacilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges.A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensatethe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes anda general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden ofthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loansgreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bondswhich the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is anadditional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in myjudgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existinginterests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions toreorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniformnational circulation for the local and various circulation, secured andunsecured, now issued by them.The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans andbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30thJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 werederived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from publiclands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loansin all forms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, :$2,257,065.80, was thebalance from last year.The disbursements during the same period were: For Congressional,executive, and judicial purposes, $5,939.009.29; for foreignintercourse, $1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including themints, loans, Post Office deficiencies, collection of revenue, andother like charges, $14,129,771.50; for expenses under the InteriorDepartment, 985.52; under the War Department, $394,368,407.36; underthe Navy Department, $42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt,$13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursementof temporary loan and redemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregateof $570,841,700.25, and leaving a balance in the Treasury on the 1stday of July, 1862, of $13,043,546.81.It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended forreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also inthe loans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts andexpenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97,and the expenditures $474,744,778.16.Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in thereport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and viewsI invite your most candid and considerate attention.The reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewithtransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more thanbrief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions andoperations conducted through those Departments. Nor could I give asummary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its beingmuch shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myselfwith laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them.It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financialcondition of the Post Office Department as compared with severalpreceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to$8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of theUnion for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation ofrevenue from the so called seceded States during the last fiscal year,the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has beensufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90,being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of theUnion during the previous year. The expenditures show a still morefavorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. Forthe last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing adecrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with thepreceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was$4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to$2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to thecessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part toa careful review of all expenditures in that Department in the interestof economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, hasalso been much improved. The Postmaster General has also opened acorrespondence through the Department of State with foreign governmentsproposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose ofsimplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreignmails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens andto the commercial interests of this country, has been favorablyentertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies havebeen received.I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of thePostmaster General in his report respecting the further legislationrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to thepublic lands: The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue.From the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cashreceipts from the sale of lands were $137,476.26 a sum much less thanthe expenses of our land system during the same period. The homesteadlaw, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers suchinducements to settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to anextent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office andthe cost of surveying and bringing the land into market.The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the salesof the public lands and the sum derived from the same source asreported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from thefact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not reallycoincident at the beginning point, the Treasury report including aconsiderable sum now which had previously been reported from theInterior, sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived fromthe three months now reported upon by the Interior and not by theTreasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the pastyear manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points haveengaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in theirvicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansasrenounced their allegiance to the United States and entered intotreaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the UnitedStates were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees hasvisited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations ofthe tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrainedby superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and thatthe United States neglected to furnish the protection which theirtreaty stipulations required.In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked thesettlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killingindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was whollyunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been prodded. It isestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians,and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak wasinduced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust,need not to be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureaufrom different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that asimultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by allthe tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. TheState of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. Alarge portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe losshas been sustained by the destruction of property. The people of thatState manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond thelimits of the State as a guaranty against future hostilities. TheCommissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit foryour especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not beremodeled. Many wise and good men have impressed me with the beliefthat this can be profitably done.I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which showsthe progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing thePacific Railroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of thisroad, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects nowpending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals inNew York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasingimportance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interiorregion hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purposehaving prepared and laid before you at an early day some interestingand valuable statistical information upon this subject. The militaryand commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canaland improving the Illinois River is presented in the report of ColonelWebster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. Irespectfully ask attention to it.To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of Maylast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United Statesto be organized.The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months thisDepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence andexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highlybeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recentimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, andin the collection of the agricultural statistics of the differentStates.Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds,cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberallydiffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaboratereport, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuabletests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.The creation of this Department was for the more immediate benefit of alarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberalbasis upon which it has been organized will not only meet yourapprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondestanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitfulsource of advantage to all our people.On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by theExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance withthe purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I nowrespectfully recall your attention to what may be called "compensatedemancipation."A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and itslaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability."One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but theearth abideth forever." It is of the first importance to duly considerand estimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth\'ssurface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United Statesis well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is notwell adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety ofclimate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people,whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, andintelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination forone united people.In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy ofdisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the twosections. I did so in language which I can not improve, and which,therefore, I beg to repeat: One section of our country believes slaveryis right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrongand ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. Thefugitive slave clause of the Constitution and the law for thesuppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced,perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense ofthe people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of thepeople abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few breakover in each. This I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would beworse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before.The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would beultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitiveslaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at allby the other. Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can notremove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassablewall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of thepresence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts ofour country can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, andintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them, Isit possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or moresatisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treatieseasier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfullyenforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go towar, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sidesand no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions,as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. There is no line,straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which todivide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between thefree and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one thirdof its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon tobe populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaininglength are merely surveyors\' lines, over which people may walk back andforth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this linecan be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper orparchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes,gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause,along with all other constitutional obligations upon the sectionseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever bemade to take its place.But there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded eastby the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the RockyMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn andcotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota,Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people,and will have 50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by anypolitical folly or mistake. It contains more than one third of thecountry owned by the United States certainly more than 1,000,000square miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, itwould have more than 75,000,000 people. A glance at the map shows that,territorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic. The otherparts are but marginal borders to it. The magnificent region slopingwest from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and alsothe richest in undeveloped resources. In the production of provisionsgrains, grasses, and all which proceed from them this great interiorregion is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertainfrom the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yetbeen brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidlyincreasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with themagnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has noseacoast touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its peoplenow find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, toSouth America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco;but separate our common country into two nations, as designed by thepresent rebellion, and every man of this great interior region isthereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps bya physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south ofKentucky or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none southof it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of itcan trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictatedby a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south,are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting and toinhabit this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the bestis no proper question. All are better than either, and all of rightbelong to that people and to their successors forever. True tothemselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, butwill vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginalregions less interested in these communications to and through them tothe great outside world. They, too, and each of them, must have accessto this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of anynational boundary.Our national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from theland we inhabit: not from our national homestead. There is no possiblesevering of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. Inall its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhorsseparation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much ofblood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertainsto ourselves to the passing generations of men and it can withoutconvulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation.In this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution andarticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States: Resolvedby the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States ofAmerica in Congress assembled (two thirds of both Houses concurring),That the following articles be proposed to the legislatures (orconventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution ofthe United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified bythree fourths of the said legislatures (or conventions ), to be validas part or parts of the said Constitution, viz:ART. . Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish thesame therein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, A. D.1900, shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, towit:The President of the United States shall deliver to every such Statebonds of the United States bearing interest at the rate of per cent perannum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ____ for each slaveshown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States,said bonds to be delivered to such State by installments or in oneparcel at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the sameshall have been gradual or at one time within such State; and interestshall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of itsdelivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid andafterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund tothe United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and allinterest paid thereon.ART. All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chancesof the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be foreverfree; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall becompensated for them at the same rates as is provided for Statesadopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall betwice accounted for.ART. Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide forcolonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place orplaces without the United States. I beg indulgence to discuss theseproposed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion couldnever have existed; without slavery it could not continue.Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentimentand of policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us.Some would perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly andwithout compensation; some would abolish it gradually and withcompensation: some would remove the freed people from us, and somewould retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities.Because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles amongourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize and act together.This would be compromise, but it would be compromise among the friendsand not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended toembody a plan of such mutual concessions. If the plan shall be adopted,it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of theStates.As to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;secondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty seven years);and, thirdly, the compensation.The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetualslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate theirdissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of suddenderangement in fact, from the necessity of any derangement while mostof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by themeasure will have passed away before its consummation. They will neversee it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but willdeprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too littleto the now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves themfrom the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediateemancipation in localities where their numbers are very great, and itgives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be freeforever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it toabolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at anyintermediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any partof the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It alsoprovides for compensation, and generally the mode of making it. This,it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those whofavor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive thecompensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receivewill object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In a certainsense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property propertyacquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. Itis no less true for having been often said that the people of the Southare not more responsible for the original introduction of this propertythan are the people of the North; and when it is remembered howunhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits ofdealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South hasbeen more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, fora common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just thatit be done at a common charge?And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve thebenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is itnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let usascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensatedemancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether if thatmeasure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave States thesame sum would not have done more to close the war than has beenotherwise done. If so, the measure would save money, and in that viewwould be a prudent and economical measure. Certainly it is not so easyto pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay alarge sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay anysum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. The warrequires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sumnecessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large. But itwould require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than theemancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, closebefore the end of the thirty seven years. At that time we shallprobably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, insteadof thirty one millions as now. And not only so, but the increase of ourpopulation may be expected to continue for a long time after thatperiod as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have becomefull. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio ofincrease which we have maintained, on an average, from our firstnational census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have apopulation of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio farbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead, isour ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the BritishIsles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated.Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled tosend part of the native born away. But such is not our condition. Wehave 2,963,000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a populationaveraging 73 1/3 persons to the square mile. Why may not our country atsome time average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more wastesurface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is itinferior to Europe in any natural advantage? If, then, we are at sometime to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, wecan judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever,depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our Statesare already above the average of Europe 73 1/3 to the square mile.Massachusetts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York andNew Jersey, each 80. Also two other great States, Pennsylvania andOhio, are not far below, the former having 63 and the latter 59. TheStates already above the European average, except New York, haveincreased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before,while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country innatural capacity for sustaining a dense population.Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population andratio of increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows:Year   Population   Ratio of increase.    Per cent.1790   3,929,827   ..........1800   5,304,937   35.021810   7,239,814   36.451820   9,638,131   36.451830   12,866,020   33.491840   17,069,453   32.671850   23,191,876   35.871860   31,443,790   35.58This shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent inpopulation through the seventy years from our first to our last censusyet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of theseseven periods is either 2 per cent below or 2 per cent above theaverage, thus showing how inflexible, and consequently how reliable,the law of increase in our case is. Assuming that it will continue, itgives the following results:Year   Population1870   42,323,3411880   56,967,2161890   76,677,8721900   103,208,4151910   138,918,5261920   186,984,3351930   251,680,914These figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now isat some point between 1920 and 1930 say about 1925 our territory, at73 1/3 persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain217,186,000.And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish thechance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting warspringing from the only great element of national discord among us.While it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge example ofsecession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population,civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of itwould be very great and injurious.The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth ofthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debtwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 percent per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionarystruggle until to day, without paying anything on either principal orinterest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than eachman owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through thewhole period has been greater than 6 per cent has run faster than theinterest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, solong as its population increases faster than unpaid interestaccumulates on its debt.This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justlydue, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection thegreat advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until wenumber 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now,when we number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar willbe much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar foremancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost noblood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both.As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to returnto bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them,doubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and henceprovision is made in this article for compensating such. The thirdarticle relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige,but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as mayconsent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one handor on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutualconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters, throughtheir representatives in Congress.I can not make it better known than it already is that I strongly favorcolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged againstfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largelyimaginary, if not sometimes malicious.It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace whitelabor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for merecatch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the presentmen should utter nothing for which they would not willingly beresponsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, thatcolored people can displace any more white labor by being free than byremaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle nowhite laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open towhite laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it.Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance thewages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus thecustomary amount of labor would still have to be performed the freedpeople would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, andvery probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part towhite laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, andconsequently enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to alimited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematicallycertain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market increase thedemand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply ofblack labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and byprecisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor.But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover thewhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make themany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the wholecountry, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could theone in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communitiesnow having more than one free colored person to seven whites and thiswithout any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District ofColumbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in thiscondition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites,and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has neverpresented the presence of free colored persons as one of itsgrievances. But why should emancipation South send the free peopleNorth? People of any color seldom run unless there be something to runfrom. Heretofore colored people to some extent have fled North frombondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But ifgradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neitherto flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until newlaborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly givetheir labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them incongenial climes and with people of their own blood and race. Thisproposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved. And in anyevent, can not the North decide for itself whether to receive them?Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there beenany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment ofslavery in this District last spring?What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to thewhites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no referenceto persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act ofCongress abolishing slavery here.The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that arestoration of the national authority would be accepted without itsadoption.Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Itstimely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stayboth.And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provideby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation beforethis plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Suchwould be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments applyto both.This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, butadditional to, all others for restoring and preserving the nationalauthority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively inits economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peacemore speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done byforce alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner ofpayment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be theadditional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force. It is much,very much, that it would cost no blood at all.The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It can not becomesuch without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, andafterwards three fourths of the States. The requisite three fourths ofthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Theirconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severallyadopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the newconstitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now andsave the Union forever.I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressedto the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation,nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of youhave more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet Itrust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you willperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness Imay seem to display.Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shortenthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is itdoubted that it would restore the national authority and nationalprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that wehere Congress and Executive can secure its adoption? Will not the goodpeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, canthey, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vitalobjects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not "Can any of usimagine better?" but "Can we all do better?" Object whatsoever ispossible, still the question recurs, "Can we do better?" The dogmas ofthe quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion ispiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As ourcase is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrallourselves, and then we shall save our country.Fellow citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress andthis Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. Nopersonal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us.The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor ordishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. Theworld will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union.The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold thepower and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave weassure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what wepreserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope ofearth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain,peaceful, generous, just a way which if followed the world willforever applaud and God must forever bless.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests haspassed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of ournational affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us inforeign wars to aid an inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing.Her Britannic Majesty\'s Government, as was justly expected, haveexercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostileexpeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has by a likeproceeding promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed atthe beginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy andimportance have arisen out of the blockade and other belligerentoperations between the Government and several of the maritime powers,but they have been discussed and, as far as was possible, accommodatedin a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good will. It isespecially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality oftheir adjudications, have commanded the respect and confidence ofmaritime powers.The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain forthe suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 17th day ofFebruary last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It isbelieved that so far as American ports and American citizens areconcerned that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.I shall submit for the consideration of the Senate a convention for theadjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory arising out ofthe treaty of the 15th June, 1846, between the United States and GreatBritain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among thecitizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritimejurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba,has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed inan amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power.A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.I have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, toconcur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for theliquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles which have beenheretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in thewaters of Denmark.  The long pending controversy between thisGovernment and that of Chile touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru,by Chilean officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging tocitizens of the United States has been brought to a close by the awardof His Majesty the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration thequestion was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly andpatiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and althoughthe sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as theyexpected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His Majesty\'sdecision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chile whenintelligence in regard to it reached that country.The joint commission under the act of the last session for carryinginto effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has beenorganized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.Difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are incourse of amicable adjustment.In conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, Ihave received a representative from the United States of Colombia, andhave accredited a minister to that Republic.Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced uponmy attention the uncertain state of international questions touchingthe rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizensabroad. In regard to some governments these rights are at leastpartially, defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is itexpressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreignerresiding in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to beexempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whosebehalf the Government or his country can not expect any privileges orimmunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, thatsuch claims have been put forward, and in some instances in behalf offoreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part oftheir lives.There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countrieswho have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have beenfully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them bydenying the fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden ofproof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain thisproof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information.These might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts wheredeclarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected tosend periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized ordeclaring their intention to become citizens to the Secretary of theInterior, in whose Department those names might be arranged and printedfor general information.There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently becomecitizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading dutiesimposed by the laws of their native countries, to which on becomingnaturalized here they at once repair, and though never returning to theUnited States they still claim the interposition of this Government ascitizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisenout of this abuse. It is therefore submitted to your seriousconsideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which nocitizen of the United States residing abroad may claim theinterposition of his Government.The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliensunder pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed whendrafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such anamendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppelagainst any plea of exemption from military service or other civilobligation on the ground of alienage.In common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have beenbrought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of thehereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberalpolicy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society ofnations. It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that thesedifficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to theclaim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained inthe destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,which, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line oftelegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of aninternational telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of atelegraph between this capital and the national forts along theAtlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications,established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well aseffective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service.The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of thelast Congress, begins to be self sustaining, and there is reason tohope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade whichwill ensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have beenfaithful in defending American rights. In protecting commercialinterests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increasedlabors and responsibilities growing out of the war. These they have forthe most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. Thisacknowledgment justly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco,Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries, are chargedwith complex functions and extraordinary powers.The condition of the several organized Territories is generallysatisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not beenentirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho,New Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretoforeunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from thegovernor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration theexpediency of establishing a system for the encouragement ofimmigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength isagain flowing with greater freedom than for several years before theinsurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers inevery field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, aswell of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the demand forlabor is much increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destituteof remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates andoffering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap,assistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that under the sharpdiscipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life. This nobleeffort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and supportof the Government.Injuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some caseshave been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries,both at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the UnitedStates. As this Government expects redress from other powers whensimilar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service uponcitizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice toforeigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to thispurpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear anddecide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisenunder treaties and the public law. Conventions for adjusting the claimsby joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but nodefinitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any.In the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to requestyou to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees ofrestitution have been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts,and in other cases where this Government may be acknowledged to beliable in principle and where the amount of that liability has beenascertained by an informal arbitration.The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required bythe law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon theincomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may notin strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of anyexisting treaty between the United States and a foreign country, theexpediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the incomeof such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived fromthe emoluments of their office or from property not situated in theUnited States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make thissuggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocatedexempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extentthus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to beexceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.The operations of the Treasury during the last year have beensuccessfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national bankinglaw has proved a valuable support of the public credit and the generallegislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations ofits favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws,but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to beneeded.Since these measures have been in operation all demands on theTreasury, including the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptlymet and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it isbelieved, were ever more amply provided and more liberally andpunctually paid, and it may be added that by no people were the burdensincident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne.The receipts during the year from all sources, including loans andbalance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, andthe aggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the1st of July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derivedfrom customs $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, fromdirect tax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneoussources $3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making theaggregate $901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for thecivil service $23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79,for interest on public debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department$599,298,600.83, for the Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment offunded and temporary debt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate$895,796,630.65 and leaving the balance of $5,329,044.21. But thepayment of funded and temporary debt, having been made from moneysborrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal paymentsand the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, andtheir amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore be deducted both fromreceipts and disbursements. This being done there remains as actualreceipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements $714,709,995.58,leaving the balance as already stated.The actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and theestimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quartersof the current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the reportof the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. Itis sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual resultswill exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country thanthe estimates of that officer heretofore submitted, while it isconfidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursementsand debt will be found very considerably less than has beenanticipated.The report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. Itconsists of 1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of theGeneral in Chief. 2. The organization of colored persons into the warservice. 3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter ofGeneral Hitchcock. 4. The operations under the act for enrolling andcalling out the national forces, detailed in the report of theProvost Marshal General. 5. The organization of the invalidcorps, and 6. The operation of the several departments of theQuartermaster General, Commissary General, Paymaster General, Chief ofEngineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Surgeon General.It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,except such as would be too extended for this place, and hence Icontent myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the yearand throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been dischargedwith fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has beenconstantly increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on solong a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicittrade. From returns received at the Navy Department it appears thatmore than 1,000 vessels have been captured since the blockade wasinstituted, and that the value of prizes already sent in foradjudication amounts to over $13,000,000.The naval force of the United States consists at this time of 588vessels completed and in the course of completion, and of these 75 areironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war give an increasedinterest and importance to the Navy which will probably extend beyondthe war itself.The armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which areunder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed innumber those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon forharbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength andcapacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain ourrightful position on the ocean.The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfaresince the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of wardemands either a corresponding change in some of our existingnavy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction andnecessary repair of modern naval vessels. No inconsiderableembarrassment, delay, and public injury have been experienced from thewant of such governmental establishments. The necessity of such anavy yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlanticseaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention ofCongress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the reportof the Secretary which accompanies this communication. I think it myduty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to thatof establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of theWestern rivers. A naval force has been created on those interiorwaters, and under many disadvantages, within little more than twoyears, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at thecommencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and importantas have been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy at thisinteresting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the successof our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, whichhas created a new form of naval power.Our country has advantages superior to any other nation in ourresources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel inthe immediate vicinity of both, and all available and in closeproximity to navigable waters. Without the advantage of public works,the resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayedin the construction of a Navy of such magnitude, which has at the veryperiod of its creation rendered signal service to the Union.The increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500men in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has beenaccomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties topromote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operationof the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, isbeginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if notcorrected, be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen fromtheir proper vocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I thereforerespectfully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and navalservices by a definite provision on this subject which would at thesame time be equitable to the communities more especially interested.I commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of theNavy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and alsothe education of officers and engineers for the naval service. TheNaval Academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen forthe highly responsible duties which in after life they will be requiredto perform. In order that the country should not be deprived of theproper quota of educated officers, for which legal provision has beenmade at the naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect oromission to make nominations from the States in insurrection have beenfilled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full andcomplete than at any former period, and in every respect entitled tothe favorable consideration of Congress.During the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post OfficeDepartment has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified inbeing able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaledthe entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and theformer to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiencyamounted to $5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being$2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in theannual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, butthe annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 percent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department maybecome self sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of thewhole service.The international conference of postal delegates from the principalcountries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion ofthe Postmaster General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last andconcluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principlesestablished by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postalintercourse between nations and as the basis of future postalconventions inaugurate a general system of uniform internationalcharges at reduced rates of postage, and can not fail to producebeneficial results.I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which isherewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relationto the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and othermatters of public concern pertaining to his Department.The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarterof the present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acreswere sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homesteadlaw, and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for militarybounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that thesale of the public lands is largely on the increase.It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmenthat the people of the United States had a higher and more enduringinterest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of thepublic lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived fromthe sale of them. This opinion has had a controlling influence inshaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain. I may citeas evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actualsettlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within theirlimits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit forcultivation; the grants to railway companies of alternate sections ofland upon the contemplated issues of their roads, which when completedwill so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distantpossessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficentillustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actualsettlers. Since the 1st day of January last the before mentionedquantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up under itsprovisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifyingevidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands,notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nationhave been engaged, and which has required so large a withdrawal of ourcitizens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in therecommendation of the Secretary of the Interior suggesting amodification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military andnaval service of the United States. I doubt not that Congress willcheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changingthe general features of the system, secure to the greatest practicableextent its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defenseof the country in this arduous crisis.I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to thepropriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from themineral lands of the United States.The measures provided at your last session for the removal of certainIndian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have beennegotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutionalaction of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing thepossessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.It is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in theestablishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribesas have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with ouroutlying settlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperativeduty to these wards of the Government demand our anxious and constantattention to their material well being, to their progress in the artsof civilization, and, above all, to that moral training which under theblessing of Divine Providence will confer upon them the elevated andsanctifying influences, the hopes and consolations, of the Christianfaith. I suggested in my last annual message the propriety ofremodeling our Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me ofits necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretaryevince the urgent need for immediate legislative action.I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by theGovernment in this District to your generous and fostering care. Theattention of Congress during the last session was engaged to someextent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication betweenthe Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,however, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatestrespectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the samesubject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressedto the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to laybefore you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its ownway I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to yourwisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented interest is given to thissubject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad,under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion. Theenlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road.I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of theDepartment of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments inthat vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago,the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had beenmany conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results; therebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone ofpublic feeling and opinion, at home and abroad was not satisfactory.With other signs, the popular elections then just past indicateduneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold andmenacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accentsof pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Ourcommerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon andfurnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with suchadditions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the seaand raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from EuropeanGovernments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminaryemancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running itsassigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month later thefinal proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men ofsuitable condition would be received into the war service. The policyof emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future anew aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertainconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civiladministration, the General Government had no lawful power to effectemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped thatthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a militarymeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for itmight come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would thenbe presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by darkand doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted totake another review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back,and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated bythe rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practicalcommunication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have beensubstantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens ineach, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of therebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respectiveStates. Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation,Maryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerateany restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, onlydispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits.Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000are now in the United States military service, about one half of whichnumber actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the doubleadvantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause andsupplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many whitemen. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as goodsoldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence orcruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks.These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and,contemporary with such discussion, the tone of public sentiment thereis much improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed,supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual electionsfollowing are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is tobear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the newreckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of theUnion is past.Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to aresumption of the national authority within the States wherein thatauthority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue aproclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. On examinationof this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing willbe attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True,the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The manis only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. TheConstitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardonat his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant onterms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.It is also proffered that if in any of the States named a Stategovernment shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such governmentshall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that underit the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protectedagainst invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligationof the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union arepublican form of government and to protect the State in the casesstated is explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of thisprovision only to a State government set up in this particular way?This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein theelement within a State favorable to republican government in the Unionmay be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to oreven within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which weare now dealing.An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very elementagainst whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simplyabsurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposingelements, so as to build only from the sound; and that test is asufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make asworn recantation of his former unsoundness.But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the politicalbody an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States andto the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regardto slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth forthe purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give themtheir fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. Inmy judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for whichthey were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquisha lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach offaith. I may add at this point that while I remain in my presentposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipationproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free bythe terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. Forthese and other reasons it is thought best that support of thesemeasures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed theExecutive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration offorfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withholdaltogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for thepublic interest. It should be observed also that this part of the oathis subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation andsupreme judicial decision.The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonabletemporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the viewof possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at bestattend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout wholeStates. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in thoseStates may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of theiraffliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves,while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse isabridged by the proposition.The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the politicalframework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in thehope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor andavoid great confusion.But why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is besetwith the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long orbe taken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seemready for action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallyingpoint a plan of action, Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than Bthat of A? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that theGeneral Government here will reject their plan? By the proclamation aplan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point,and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. Thismay bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objectionsto a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consistin the danger of committals on points which could be more safely leftto further developments. Care has been taken to so shape the documentas to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that on certainterms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is notsaid that other classes or other terms will never be in included.Saying specified way, it is said that reconstruction will be acceptedif presented in a not said it will never be accepted in any other way.The movements by State action for emancipation in several of the Statesnot included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profoundgratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretoforeso earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelingsremain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fairopportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation. Inthe midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight ofthe fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that poweralone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people inthe contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrunthem. Until that confidence shall be established little can be doneanywhere for what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest caremust still be directed to the Army and Navy, who have thus far bornetheir harder part so nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunatethat in giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms wedo also honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander tosentinel, who compose them, and to whom more than to others the worldmust stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated,enlarged, and perpetuated.
Abraham Lincoln
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim ourprofoundest gratitude to Almighty God.The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.Mexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our politicalrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at thesame time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competentengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan andthe port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that thedifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensionsand caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have beenamicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the routewill soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. Wecould not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importanceof that great improvement.It would be doing injustice to an important South American State not toacknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which theUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations withthis Government. A claims convention has been constituted to completethe unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect withthe universal acquiescence of the people, the Government under it hasbeen recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in acordial and friendly spirit. The long deferred Aves Island claim hasbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged.Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late jointcommission for the settlement of claims between the United States andPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between thetwo countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used toremove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru andSpain.Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the ArgentineRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti.During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any ofthose Republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with theUnited States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonianin 1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile. Civil warcontinues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently withoutprospect of an early close.Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and itgives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in thatRepublic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from Americaninfluence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the UnitedStates.I solicit your authority to furnish to the Republic a gunboat atmoderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments.Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the nativeAfrican races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective inarresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands. Thepossession of the least organized naval force would stimulate agenerous ambition in the Republic, and the confidence which we shouldmanifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward thecolony from all civilized nations.The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the wayof Behrings Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned byCongress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorablecircumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordialgood will and support as well of this Government as of those of GreatBritain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of theSouth American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise andtheir readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to thatworld encircling communication. I learn with much satisfaction that thenoble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coastof America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation ofits early accomplishment.Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the countrywill be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high careerof commerce and civilization.Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in Aprillast. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporaryincumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in asuspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on thearrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations withEgypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirelysatisfactory.The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last beensuppressed, with the cooperating good offices of this Government and ofthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consularestablishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it willneed legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerceand to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with theGovernment and people of that vast Empire. China seems to be acceptingwith hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercialand social intercourse among the Western nations.Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of itsGovernment, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulationsis inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has beeneffected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Ourown pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement,and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason alsoto believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminishedthe friendship of Japan toward the United States.The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened byproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now considerwhether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well asjust to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports thanit is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contrabandtrade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual militaryoccupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade.For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive,under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from anasylum in the United States. If Congress should think that proceedingsin such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be furtherregulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectuallypreventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilitiesfor their criminal occupation in our country.It is possible that if it were new and open question the maritimepowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede theprivileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the UnitedStates, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of shipsof war and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neitherless assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they werebefore that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege, toembroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and determination ofthe governments of the maritime states to defeat that design arebelieved to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own.Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especiallyin Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of theUnited States, which have required, and are likely to continue torequire, the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatoryspirit on the part of the United States, as well as of the nationsconcerned and their governments.Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britainon the adjustment of the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Pugets SoundAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to theexecution of the trust assigned to them.In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacentto the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredationscommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, ithas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of sixmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangementwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at libertyto increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find thatproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily comeinto consideration in connection with the question of continuing ormodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States,as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarilyestablished by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.I desire, however, to be understood while making this statement thatthe colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionallyunjust or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary,there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the ImperialGovernment, they will take the necessary measures to prevent newincursions across the border.The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigrationhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to needamendment which will enable the officers of the Government to preventthe practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and ontheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice ofavocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward thisgreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, andought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effectivenational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principalreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair theravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in itspresent fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way makeit manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntarymilitary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lotin our country.The financial affairs of the Government have been successfullyadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last sessionof Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficienttime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several ofthe provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis ofwarrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans andthe balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were$1,394,796,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the samebasis, were $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, asshown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73.Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the publicdebt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, andthe actual cash operations of the Treasury were: Receipts,$884,076,646.57; disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cashbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71.Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, fromlands $588,333.29. from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and fromloans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance,$623,443,929.13.There were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensionsand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, forthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86 and leaving abalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and theestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quartersof the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasuryin detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys requiredto meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxationshould be still further increased; and I earnestly invite yourattention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additionallegislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of theSecretary.The public debt on the 1st day of July last, as appears by the books ofthe Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the warcontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far fromfive hundred millions. Held, as it is, for the most part by our ownpeople, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private,property. For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can bedistributed among all the people the better. To favor such generaldistribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, withgood effect and without injury be presented to persons of limitedmeans. With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competentand expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of somefuture issue of public securities might be held by any bona fidepurchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under suchrestrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard againstabuse of so important a privilege. This would enable every prudentperson to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want.Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities tothe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means whomight be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage ofcitizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the publicdebt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be muchoppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.The public debt on the 1st day of July last, although somewhatexceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made toCongress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of theestimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to itsprobable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of$3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conductof the operations of the Treasury.The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalistsand to the people. On the 25th day of November 584 national banks hadbeen organized, a considerable number of which were conversions fromState banks. Changes from State systems to the national system arerapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be inthe United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and nobank note circulation not secured by the Government. That theGovernment and the people will derive great benefit from this change inthe banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. Thenational system will create a reliable and permanent influence insupport of the national credit and protect the people against losses inthe use of paper money. Whether or not any further legislation isadvisable for the suppression of State bank issues it will be forCongress to determine. It seems quite clear that the Treasury can notbe satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise arestraining power over the bank note circulation of the country. Thereport of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents willdetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of thelast annual message, and also the operations of the severaladministrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. Itwill also specify the measures deemed essential for the nationaldefense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force.The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive andsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the navalservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to ourcountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized inso brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under constructionon the 1st of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying4,610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during theyear, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83vessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons.The total number of men at this time in the naval service, includingofficers, is about 51,000.There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, andthe whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is1,379, of which 267 are steamers.The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize propertythus far reported amount to $14,396,250.51. A large amount of suchproceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported.The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called intoexistence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1864, is$238,647,262.35.Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendationsof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy yard andsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vesselsand the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference wasmade in my last annual message.Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report inrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respectto prize on our inland waters.I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to thepropriety of creating the new rank of vice admiral in our navalservice. Your attention is invited to the report of thePostmaster General for a detailed account of the operations andfinancial condition of the Post Office Department.The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to$12,438,253.78 and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess ofexpenditures over receipts being $206,652.42.The views presented by the Postmaster General on the subject of specialgrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines ofocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the developmentof increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboringcountries should receive the careful consideration of Congress.It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,improvement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupiedportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impededor destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seemto have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has beencompleted in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system isfirmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren anduninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which havegrown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperityand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distanceand the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,have been only partially organized; but it is understood that thesedifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit theirgovernments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and fulloperation. As intimately connected with and promotive of this materialgrowth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuableinformation and important recommendations relating to the public lands,Indian affairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries containedin the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewithtransmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents,pensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to hisDepartment.The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters endingon the 30th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614acres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was locatedwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States forrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and locationfees was $1,019,446.The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year.The aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equalto the quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Statesby railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor thatgives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arisingfrom the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route ofthe main line of the road has been definitely located for 100 mileswestward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebr., and a preliminarylocation of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made fromSacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.Numerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have beenadded to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by theSierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teemswith enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believedthat the product of the mines of precious metals in that region hasduring the year reached, if not exceeded, one hundred millions invalue.It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system beremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon therecommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California,and it is believed that under the present organization the managementof the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success. Much yetremains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indiansin other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancingset tier, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretaryreiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congressis invited.The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalidsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, anddependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of diseasecontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country havebeen diligently administered. There have been added to the pensionrolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of16,770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the presentnumber of army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners712.Of widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the armypension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of armypensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At thebeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1,430.Only 12 of them were soldiers, of whom 7 have since died. The remainderare those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship toRevolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the 30th of June, 1864,$4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolentinstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto beenestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer forinformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,the Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of theSecretary.The Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its presentenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the greatand vital interest it was created to advance It is peculiarly thepeople\'s Department, in which they feel more directly concerned than inany other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering careof Congress.The war continues. Since the last annual message all the importantlines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintainedand our arms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions leftin rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of otherStates have again produced reasonably fair crops.The most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year isGeneral Sherman\'s attempted march of 300 miles directly through theinsurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relativestrength that our General in Chief should feel able to confront andhold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach awell appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result notyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.Important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect ofmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of completesuccess, it is much in the fight direction that 12,000 citizens in eachof the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal Stategovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling tomaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction, moreextensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennesseeshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of completesuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future.The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foulspirit being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo herno more.At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of theConstitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed theSenate, but failed for lack of the requisite two thirds vote in theHouse of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress andnearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom orpatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend thereconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session. Ofcourse the abstract question is not changed; but in interveningelection shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass themeasure if this does not. Hence there is only a question of time as towhen the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. Andas it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner thebetter? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty onmembers to change their views or their votes any further than, as anadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected byit. It is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon thequestion. In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of actionamong those seeking a common end is very desirable almostindispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainableunless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simplybecause it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end isthe maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that endsuch will, through the election, is most dearly declared in favor ofsuch constitutional amendment.The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country isderived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvassand its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States tomaintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearlyunanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order withwhich the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strongassurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket,so called, but a great majority of the opposing party also may befairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose. Itis an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for anyoffice whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowalthat he was for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning ofmotives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and bestmode of advancing the Union cause, but on the distinct issue of Unionor no Union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge thatthere is no diversity among the people. In affording the people thefair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world thisfirmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast valueto the national cause.The election has exhibited another tact not less valuable to beknown the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the mostimportant branch of national resources, that of living men. While it ismelancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves andcarried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know that,compared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few. While corpsand divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought anddwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men whocomposed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service.The election returns prove this. So many voters could not else befound. The States regularly holding elections, both now and four yearsago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, east3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregatenow of 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the newStates of Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thusswelling the aggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during thethree years and a half of war to 145,551. A table is appended showingparticulars. To this again should be added the number of all soldiersin the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,Indiana, Illinois, and California, who by the laws of those Statescould not vote away from their homes, and which number can not be lessthan 90,000. Nor yet is this all. The number in organized Territoriesis triple now what it was four years ago, while thousands, white andblack, join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines. Somuch is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is notmaterial to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show thatit would have been greater but for the war, which is probably true. Theimportant fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than wehad when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor in process ofexhaustion; that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintainthe contest indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are nowmore complete and abundant than ever.The national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,inexhaustible. The public purpose to reestablish and maintain thenational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. Themanner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On carefulconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that noattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in anygood. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union,precisely what we will not and can not give. His declarations to thiseffect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceiveus. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can notvoluntarily reaccept the Union; we can not voluntarily yield it.Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple, and inflexible. It isan issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If weyield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he is beaten.Either way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What istrue, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarilytrue of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept the Union, theycan. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion. Thenumber of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace simplyby laying down their arms and submitting to the national authorityunder the Constitution. Alter so much the Government could not, if itwould, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain orallow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by thepeaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operatingonly in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and otherpossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power toadjust; as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress andwhatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive poweritself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war.Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be withinExecutive control. In what spirit and temper this control would beexercised can be fairly judged of by the past.A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, wereoffered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at thesame time made known that the excepted classes were still withincontemplation of special clemency. During the year many availedthemselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that thesigns of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures asrendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the sametime also special pardons have been granted to individuals of theexcepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thuspractically the door has been for a full year open to all except suchas were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were incustody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the timemay come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it beclosed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall beadopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to thenational authority on the part of the insurgents as the onlyindispensable condition to ending the war on the part of theGovernment, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeatthe declaration made a year a ago, that "while I remain in my presentposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipationproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free bythe terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress." Ifthe people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive dutyto re enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be theirinstrument to perform it. In stating a single condition of peace I meansimply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Governmentwhenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.State   1860   1864California   118,840   110,000Connecticut   77,246   86,616Delaware   16,039   16,924Illinois   339,693   348,235Indiana   272,143   280,645Iowa   128,331   143,331Kentucky   146,216   91,300Maine   97,918   115,141Maryland   92,502   72,703Massachusetts   169,533   175,487Michigan   154,747   162,413Minnesota   34,799   42,534Missouri   165,538   90,000New Hampshire   65,953   69,111New Jersey   121,125   128,680New York   675,156   730,664Ohio   42,441   470,745Oregon   14,410   14,410+Pennsylvania   476,442   572,697Rhode Island   19,931   22,187Vermont   42,844   55,811West Virginia   46,195   33,874Wisconsin   152,180   148,513  
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this greatnation, it is with gratitude to the Giver of All Good for the many benefitswe enjoy. We are blessed with peace at home, and are without entanglingalliances abroad to forebode trouble; with a territory unsurpassed infertility, of an area equal to the abundant support of 500,000,000 people,and abounding in every variety of useful mineral in quantity sufficient tosupply the world for generations; with exuberant crops; with a variety ofclimate adapted to the production of every species of earth\'s riches andsuited to the habits, tastes, and requirements of every living thing; witha population of 40,000,000 free people, all speaking one language; withfacilities for every mortal to acquire an education; with institutionsclosing to none the avenues to fame or any blessing of fortune that may becoveted; with freedom of the pulpit, the press, and the school; with arevenue flowing into the National Treasury beyond the requirements of theGovernment. Happily, harmony is being rapidly restored within our ownborders. Manufactures hitherto unknown in our country are springing up inall sections, producing a degree of national independence unequaled by thatof any other power.These blessings and countless others are intrusted to your care and minefor safe keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office. In a shorttime we must, each of us, return to the ranks of the people, who haveconferred upon us our honors, and account to them for our stewardship. Iearnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by a free andenlightened constituency nor by our own consciences.Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, aided, as it was, by thesympathies and assistance of nations with which we were at peace, elevenStates of the Union were, four years ago, left without legal Stategovernments. A national debt had been contracted; American commerce wasalmost driven from the seas; the industry of one half of the country hadbeen taken from the control of the capitalist and placed where all laborrightfully belongs in the keeping of the laborer. The work of restoringState governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering freelabor, and providing means for paying the interest on the public debt hasreceived ample attention from Congress. Although your efforts have not metwith the success in all particulars that might have been desired, yet onthe whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonablyanticipated.Seven States which passed ordinances of secession have been fully restoredto their places in the Union. The eighth (Georgia) held an election atwhich she ratified her constitution, republican in form, elected agovernor, Members of Congress, a State legislature, and all other officersrequired. The governor was duly installed, and the legislature met andperformed all the acts then required of them by the reconstruction acts ofCongress. Subsequently, however, in violation of the constitution whichthey had just ratified (as since decided by the supreme court of theState), they unseated the colored members of the legislature and admittedto seats some members who are disqualified by the third clause of thefourteenth amendment to the Constitution an article which they themselveshad contributed to ratify. Under these circumstances I would submit to youwhether it would not be wise, without delay, to enact a law authorizing thegovernor of Georgia to convene the members originally elected to thelegislature, requiring each member to take the oath prescribed by thereconstruction acts, and none to be admitted who are ineligible under thethird clause of the fourteenth amendment.The freedmen, under the protection which they have received, are makingrapid progress in learning, and no complaints are heard of lack of industryon their part where they receive fair remuneration for their labor. Themeans provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all otherexpenses of Government, are more than ample. The loss of our commerce isthe only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficientattention from you. To this subject I call your earnest attention. I willnot now suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, ifnecessary, make it the subject of a special message during the session ofCongress.At the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive toorder elections in the States of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, tosubmit to them the constitutions which each had previously, in convention,framed, and submit the constitutions, either entire or in separate parts,to be voted upon, at the discretion of the Executive. Under this authorityelections were called. In Virginia the election took place on the 6th ofJuly, 1869. The governor and lieutenant governor elected have beeninstalled. The legislature met and did all required by this resolution andby all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtfulauthority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be promptlyadmitted to their seats, and that the State be fully restored to its placein the family of States. Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas, tocommence on the 30th of November, 1869, and to last two days in Mississippiand four days in Texas. The elections have taken place, but the result isnot known. It is to be hoped that the acts of the legislatures of theseStates, when they meet, will be such as to receive your approval, and thusclose the work of reconstruction.Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, isthat of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will receiveyour most earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest duties,of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fixed,unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie basis, and no substitutefor it can be devised. It should be commenced now and reached at theearliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interestsof the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not bedesirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay, beyond their contracts,the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bringbankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuation, however, in the paper valueof the measure of all values (gold) is detrimental to the interests oftrade. It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler, for in allsales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to whatwill be the value of the currency to be paid and received. I earnestlyrecommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return tospecie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value ofcurrency.The methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as arethe speculators on political economy. To secure the latter I see but oneway, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper, at afixed price, whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation allcurrency so redeemed until sold again for gold.The vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought tomake our credit the best on earth. With a less burden of taxation than thecitizen has endured for six years past, the entire public debt could bepaid in ten years. But it is not desirable that the people should be taxedto pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in arapid ratio. But the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly ascan be done without the violation of contract. The public debt isrepresented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from tento forty years to run, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent and 5 percent, respectively. It is optional with the Government to pay these bondsat any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon theirface. The time has already expired when a great part of them may be takenup, and is rapidly approaching when all may be. It is believed that allwhich are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest notexceeding 4 1/2 per cent, and as rapidly as the remainder become due thatthey may be replaced in the same way. To accomplish this it may benecessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or fourof the money centers of Europe, or by any assistant treasurer of the UnitedStates, at the option of the holder of the bond. I suggest this subject forthe consideration of Congress, and also, simultaneously with this, thepropriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its marketvalue at the time the law goes into effect, increasing the rate at whichcurrency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at thesame rate of interest as Government pays upon its bonds.The subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive yourattention. The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements,and may with safety be reduced. But as the funding of the debt in a 4 or a4 1/2 per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely, thus,after funding, justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be nowexpedient, I suggest postponement of this question until the next meetingof Congress.It may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjustor burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but a generalrevision of the laws regulating this subject I recommend the postponementof for the present. I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes, butat a reduced rate, say of 3 per cent, and this tax to expire in threeyears.With the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel safe insaying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely fromsixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and may be still furtherreduced from year to year, as the resources of the country are developed.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of theGovernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, to be $370,943,747,and the expenditures, including interest, bounties, etc., to be$321,490,597. The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to theGovernment, and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the publicdebt.The receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amountnecessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund, as provided by law.To lock up the surplus in the Treasury and withhold it from circulationwould lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade andseriously affect the prosperity of the country. Under these circumstancesthe Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in thepropriety of using all the surplus currency in the Treasury in the purchaseof Government bonds, thus reducing the interest bearing indebtedness of thecountry, and of submitting to Congress the question of the disposition tobe made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasuryamount to about seventy five millions, including those belonging to thesinking fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of thesinking fund.Your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of theSecretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner ofcustoms revenue; for the increase of salaries to certain classes ofofficials; the substitution of increased national bank circulation toreplace the outstanding 3 per cent certificates; and most especially to hisrecommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines, penalties,forfeitures, etc., to officers of the Government or to informers.The office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most arduousand responsible under the Government. It falls but little, if any, short ofa Cabinet position in its importance and responsibilities. I would ask forit, therefore, such legislation as in your judgment will place the officeupon a footing of dignity commensurate with its importance and with thecharacter and qualifications of the class of men required to fill itproperly.As the United States is the freest of all nations, so, too, its peoplesympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self government; butwhile so sympathizing it is due to our honor that we should abstain fromenforcing our views upon unwilling nations and from taking an interestedpart, without invitation, in the quarrels between different nations orbetween governments and their subjects. Our course should always be inconformity with strict justice and law, international and local. Such hasbeen the policy of the Administration in dealing with these questions. Formore than a year a valuable province of Spain, and a near neighbor of ours,in whom all our people can not but feel a deep interest, has beenstruggling for independence and freedom. The people and Government of theUnited States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for thepeople of Cuba in their pending struggle that they manifested throughoutthe previous struggles between Spain and her former colonies in behalf ofthe latter. But the contest has at no time assumed the conditions whichamount to a war in the sense of international law, or which would show theexistence of a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficientto justify a recognition of belligerency.The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judgewhen to accord the rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling tofree themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive or toindependent nations at war with each other.The United States have no disposition to interfere with the existingrelations of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. Theybelieve that in due time Spain and other European powers will find theirinterest in terminating those relations and establishing their presentdependencies as independent powers members of the family of nations. Thesedependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from oneEuropean power to another. When the present relation of colonies ceases,they are to become independent powers, exercising the right of choice andof self control in the determination of their future condition andrelations with other powers.The United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in theinterest of a neighboring people, proposed their good offices to bring theexisting contest to a termination. The offer, not being accepted by Spainon a basis which we believed could be received by Cuba, was withdrawn. Itis hoped that the good offices of the United States may yet proveadvantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile a numberof illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up. It has been theendeavor of the Administration to execute the neutrality laws in goodfaith, no matter how unpleasant the task, made so by the sufferings we haveendured from lack of like good faith toward us by other nations.On the 26th of March last the United States schooner Lizzie Major wasarrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers takenfrom it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representations of these factswere made to the Spanish Government as soon as official information of themreached Washington. The two passengers were set at liberty, and the SpanishGovernment assured the United States that the captain of the frigate inmaking the capture had acted without law, that he had been reprimanded forthe irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish authorities in Cubawould not sanction any act that could violate the rights or treat withdisrespect the sovereignty of this nation.The question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell at one of the BahamaIslands by Spanish authorities is now the subject of correspondence betweenthis Government and those of Spain and Great Britain.The Captain General of Cuba about May last issued a proclamationauthorizing search to be made of vessels on the high seas. Immediateremonstrance was made against this, whereupon the Captain General issued anew proclamation limiting the right of search to vessels of the UnitedStates so far as authorized under the treaty of 1795. This proclamation,however, was immediately withdrawn.I have always felt that the most intimate relations should be cultivatedbetween the Republic of the United States and all independent nations onthis continent. It may be well worth considering whether new treatiesbetween us and them may not be profitably entered into, to secure moreintimate relations friendly, commercial, and otherwise.The subject of an interoceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacificoceans through the Isthmus of Darien is one in which commerce is greatlyinterested. Instructions have been given to our minister to the Republic ofthe United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a surveyby this Government, in order to determine the practicability of such anundertaking, and a charter for the right of way to build, by privateenterprise, such a work, if the survey proves it to be practicable.In order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixedcommission at Lima for the adjustment of claims, it became necessary tosend a commissioner and secretary to Lima in August last. No appropriationhaving been made by Congress for this purpose, it is now asked that one bemade covering the past and future expenses of the commission.The good offices of the United States to bring about a peace between Spainand the South American Republics with which she is at war having beenaccepted by Spain, Peru, and Chile, a congress has been invited to be heldin Washington during the present winter.A grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit overthe territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rico has given its assent,which, it is alleged, conflicts with vested rights of citizens of theUnited States. The Department of State has now this subject underconsideration.The minister of Peru having made representations that there was a state ofwar between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing, in and nearNew York, thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as torelieve the naval force at Cuba, so as to operate against Peru, orders weregiven to prevent their departure. No further steps having been taken by therepresentative of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of thesevessels, and I not feeling authorized to detain the property of a nationwith which we are at peace on a mere Executive order, the matter has beenreferred to the courts to decide.The conduct of the war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay hasmade the intercourse with that country so difficult that it has been deemedadvisable to withdraw our representative from there.Toward the close of the last Administration a convention was signed atLondon for the settlement of all outstanding claims between Great Britainand the United States, which failed to receive the advice and consent ofthe Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attendingthe negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by thepeople of the United States, and its provisions were wholly inadequate forthe settlement of the grave wrongs that had been sustained by thisGovernment, as well as by its citizens. The injuries resulting to theUnited States by reason of the course adopted by Great Britain during ourlate civil war in the increased rates of insurance; in the diminution ofexports and imports, and other obstructions to domestic industry andproduction; in its effect upon the foreign commerce of the country; in thedecrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine; in theprolongation of the war and the increased cost (both in treasure and inlives) of its suppression could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinarycommercial claims, which continually arise between commercial nations; andyet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary claims, from whichthey differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in themagnitude of their amount, great even as is that difference. Not a word wasfound in the treaty, and not an inference could be drawn from it, to removethe sense of the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in ourstruggle for existence, which had so deeply and universally impresseditself upon the people of this country.Believing that a convention thus misconceived in its scope and inadequatein its provisions would not have produced the hearty, cordial settlement ofpending questions, which alone is consistent with the relations which Idesire to have firmly established between the United States and GreatBritain, I regarded the action of the Senate in rejecting the treaty tohave been wisely taken in the interest of peace and as a necessary step inthe direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the twocountries. A sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at easeunder a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of asettlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their gravesense of the grievance they have sustained. The rejection of the treaty wasfollowed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I thought notfavorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations. I accordingly soinstructed the minister of the United States to Great Britain, and foundthat my views in this regard were shared by Her Majesty\'s ministers. I hopethat the time may soon arrive when the two Governments can approach thesolution of this momentous question with an appreciation of what is due tothe rights, dignity, and honor of each, and with the determination not onlyto remove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay the foundation ofa broad principle of public law which will prevent future differences andtend to firm and continued peace and friendship.This is now the only grave question which the United States has with anyforeign nation.The question of renewing a treaty for reciprocal trade between the UnitedStates and the British Provinces on this continent has not been favorablyconsidered by the Administration. The advantages of such a treaty would bewholly in favor of the British producer. Except, possibly, a few engaged inthe trade between the two sections, no citizen of the United States wouldbe benefited by reciprocity. Our internal taxation would prove a protectionto the British producer almost equal to the protection which ourmanufacturers now receive from the tariff. Some arrangement, however, forthe regulation of commercial intercourse between the United States and theDominion of Canada may be desirable.The commission for adjusting the claims of the "Hudsons Bay and Puget SoundAgricultural Company" upon the United States has terminated its labors. Theaward of $650,000 has been made and all rights and titles of the company onthe territory of the United States have been extinguished. Deeds for theproperty of the company have been delivered. An appropriation by Congressto meet this sum is asked.The commissioners for determining the northwestern land boundary betweenthe United States and the British possessions under the treaty of 1856 havecompleted their labors, and the commission has been dissolved.In conformity with the recommendation of Congress, a proposition was earlymade to the British Government to abolish the mixed courts created underthe treaty of April 7, 1862, for the suppression of the slave trade. Thesubject is still under negotiation.It having come to my knowledge that a corporate company, organized underBritish laws, proposed to land upon the shores of the United States and tooperate there a submarine cable, under a concession from His Majesty theEmperor of the French of an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphiccommunication between the shores of France and the United States, with thevery objectionable feature of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby tothe scrutiny and control of the French Government, I caused the French andBritish legations at Washington to be made acquainted with the probablepolicy of Congress on this subject, as foreshadowed by the bill whichpassed the Senate in March last. This drew from the representatives of thecompany an agreement to accept as the basis of their operations theprovisions of that bill, or of such other enactment on the subject as mightbe passed during the approaching session of Congress; also, to use theirinfluence to secure from the French Government a modification of theirconcession, so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cablebelonging to any company incorporated by the authority of the United Statesor of any State in the Union, and, on their part, not to oppose theestablishment of any such cable. In consideration of this agreement Idirected the withdrawal of all opposition by the United States authoritiesto the landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting ofCongress. I regret to say that there has been no modification made in thecompany\'s concession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they attempted tosecure one. Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of theUnited States from competition upon the shores of France. I recommendlegislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States, as wellas the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, against such an assumption. Ishall also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an abandonment of theprinciple of monopolies in ocean telegraphic cables. Copies of thiscorrespondence are herewith furnished.The unsettled political condition of other countries, less fortunate thanour own, sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States forthe sole purpose of becoming naturalized. Having secured this, they returnto their native country and reside there, without disclosing their changeof allegiance. They accept official positions of trust or honor, which canonly be held by citizens of their native land; they journey under passportsdescribing them as such citizens; and it is only when civil discord, afterperhaps years of quiet, threatens their persons or their property, or whentheir native state drafts them into its military service, that the fact oftheir change of allegiance is made known. They reside permanently away fromthe United States, they contribute nothing to its revenues, they avoid theduties of its citizenship, and they only make themselves known by a claimof protection. I have directed the diplomatic and consular officers of theUnited States to scrutinize carefully all such claims for protection. Thecitizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who discharges hisduty to his country, is entitled to its complete protection. While I have avoice in the direction of affairs I shall not consent to imperil thissacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants.On the accession of the present Administration it was found that theminister for North Germany had made propositions for the negotiation of aconvention for the protection of emigrant passengers, to which no responsehad been given. It was concluded that to be effectual all the maritimepowers engaged in the trade should join in such a measure. Invitations havebeen extended to the cabinets of London, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels,The Hague, Copenhagen, and Stockholm to empower their representatives atWashington to simultaneously enter into negotiations and to conclude withthe United States conventions identical in form, making uniform regulationsas to the construction of the parts of vessels to be devoted to the use ofemigrant passengers, as to the quality and quantity of food, as to themedical treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be observed duringthe voyage, in order to secure ventilation, to promote health, to preventintrusion, and to protect the females; and providing for the establishmentof tribunals in the several countries for enforcing such regulations bysummary process.Your attention is respectfully called to the law regulating the tariff onRussian hemp, and to the question whether to fix the charges on Russianhemp higher than they are fixed upon manila is not a violation of ourtreaty with Russia placing her products upon the same footing with those ofthe most favored nations.Our manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under theencouragement which they now receive. With the improvements in machineryalready effected, and still increasing, causing machinery to take the placeof skilled labor to a large extent, our imports of many articles must falloff largely within a very few years. Fortunately, too, manufactures are notconfined to a few localities, as formerly, and it is to be hoped willbecome more and more diffused, making the interest in them equal in allsections. They give employment and support to hundreds of thousands ofpeople at home, and retain with us the means which otherwise would beshipped abroad. The extension of railroads in Europe and the East isbringing into competition with our agricultural products like products ofother countries. Self interest, if not self preservation, thereforedictates caution against disturbing any industrial interest of the country.It teaches us also the necessity of looking to other markets for the saleof our surplus. Our neighbors south of us and China and Japan, shouldreceive our special attention. It will be the endeavor of theAdministration to cultivate such relations with all these nations as toentitle us to their confidence and make it their interest, as well as ours,to establish better commercial relations.Through the agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretoforepursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts of one of ourown distinguished citizens, the world is about to commence largelyincreased relations with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. Asthe United States have been the initiators in this new policy, so theyshould be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it asuccess. In this connection I advise such legislation as will foreverpreclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our soil under the name ofcoolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in thetransportation of coolies to any country tolerating the system. I alsorecommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class.On my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the UnitedStates it was with the conviction that three things were essential to itspeace, prosperity, and fullest development. First among these is strictintegrity in fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure protectionto the person and property of the citizen of the United States in each andevery portion of our common country, wherever he may choose to move,without reference to original nationality, religion, color, or politics,demanding of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for therights of others; third, union of all the States, with equal rights,indestructible by any constitutional means.To secure the first of these, Congress has taken two essential steps:First, in declaring by joint resolution that the public debt shall be paid,principal and interest, in coin; and, second, by providing the means forpaying. Providing the means, however, could not secure the object desiredwithout a proper administration of the laws for the collection of therevenues and an economical disbursement of them. To this subject theAdministration has most earnestly addressed itself, with results, I hope,satisfactory to the country. There has been no hesitation in changingofficials in order to secure an efficient execution of the laws, sometimes,too, when, in a mere party view, undesirable political results were likelyto follow; nor any hesitation in sustaining efficient officials againstremonstrances wholly political.It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise fromleaving on the statute books the so called "tenure of office acts," and toearnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been theintention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing thatappointments made by the President should receive the consent of theSenate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office personsplaced there by Federal appointment against the will of the President. Thelaw is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of theGovernment. What faith can an Executive put in officials forced upon him,and those, too, whom he has suspended for reason? How will such officialsbe likely to serve an Administration which they know does not trust them?For the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm buthumane administration of existing laws (amended from time to time as theymay prove ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary) are probably all thatare required.The third can not be attained by special legislation, but must be regardedas fixed by the Constitution itself and gradually acquiesced in by force ofpublic opinion.From the foundation of the Government to the present the management of theoriginal inhabitants of this continent the Indians has been a subject ofembarrassment and expense, and has been attended with continuous robberies,murders, and wars. From my own experience upon the frontiers and in Indiancountries, I do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the whiteswho come most in contact with the Indian blameless for these hostilities.The past, however, can not be undone, and the question must be met as wenow find it. I have attempted a new policy toward these wards of the nation(they can not be regarded in any other light than as wards), with fairresults so far as tried, and which I hope will be attended ultimately withgreat success. The Society of Friends is well known as having succeeded inliving in peace with the Indians in the early settlement of Pennsylvania,while their white neighbors of other sects in other sections wereconstantly embroiled. They are also known for their opposition to allstrife, violence, and war, and are generally noted for their strictintegrity and fair dealings. These considerations induced me to give themanagement of a few reservations of Indians to them and to throw the burdenof the selection of agents upon the society itself. The result has provenmost satisfactory. It will be found more fully set forth in the report ofthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs. For superintendents and Indian agentsnot on the reservations, officers of the Army were selected. The reasonsfor this are numerous. Where Indian agents are sent, there, or near there,troops must be sent also. The agent and the commander of troops areindependent of each other, and are subject to orders from differentDepartments of the Government. The army officer holds a position for life;the agent, one at the will of the President. The former is personallyinterested in living in harmony with the Indian and in establishing apermanent peace, to the end that some portion of his life may be spentwithin the limits of civilized society; the latter has no such personalinterest. Another reason is an economic one; and still another, the holdwhich the Government has upon a life officer to secure a faithful dischargeof duties in carrying out a given policy.The building of railroads, and the access thereby given to all theagricultural and mineral regions of the country, is rapidly bringingcivilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of Indians. Nomatter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and theaborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the otherhas to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of arace is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itselfthe wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard forhuman life and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see nosubstitute for such a system, except in placing all the Indians on largereservations, as rapidly as it can be done, and giving them absoluteprotection there. As soon as they are fitted for it they should be inducedto take their lands in severalty and to set up Territorial governments fortheir own protection. For full details on this subject I call your specialattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and theCommissioner of Indian Affairs.The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the WarDepartment for the year ending June 30, 1869, to be $80,644,042, of which$23,882,310 was disbursed in the payment of debts contracted during thewar, and is not chargeable to current army expenses. His estimate of$34,531,031 for the expenses of the Army for the next fiscal year is as lowas it is believed can be relied on. The estimates of bureau officers havebeen carefully scrutinized, and reduced wherever it has been deemedpracticable. If, however, the condition of the country should be such bythe beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a greaterconcentration of troops, the appropriation asked for will not be expended.The appropriations estimated for river and harbor improvements and forfortifications are submitted separately. Whatever amount Congress may deemproper to appropriate for these purposes will be expended.The recommendation of the General of the Army that appropriations be madefor the forts at Boston. Portland, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, andSan Francisco, if for no other, is concurred in. I also ask your specialattention to the recommendation of the general commanding the MilitaryDivision of the Pacific for the sale of the seal islands of St. Paul andSt. George, Alaska Territory, and suggest that it either be complied withor that legislation be had for the protection of the seal fisheries fromwhich a revenue should be derived.The report of the Secretary of War contains a synopsis of the reports ofthe heads of bureaus, of the commanders of military divisions, and of thedistricts of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, and the report of theGeneral of the Army in full. The recommendations therein contained havebeen well considered, and are submitted for your action. I, however, callspecial attention to the recommendation of the Chief of Ordnance for thesale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to the Government; also, to therecommendation of the Secretary of War that the act of 3d March, 1869,prohibiting promotions and appointments in the staff corps of the Army, berepealed. The extent of country to be garrisoned and the number of militaryposts to be occupied is the same with a reduced Army as with a large one.The number of staff officers required is more dependent upon the latterthan the former condition.The report of the Secretary of the Navy accompanying this shows thecondition of the Navy when this Administration came into office and thechanges made since. Strenuous efforts have been made to place as manyvessels "in commission," or render them fit for service if required, aspossible, and to substitute the sail for steam while cruising, thusmaterially reducing the expenses of the Navy and adding greatly to itsefficiency. Looking to our future, I recommend a liberal, though notextravagant, policy toward this branch of the public service.The report of the Postmaster General furnishes a clear and comprehensiveexhibit of the operations of the postal service and of the financialcondition of the Post Office Department. The ordinary postal revenues forthe year ending the 30th of June, 1869, amounted to $18,344,510, and theexpenditures to $23,698,131, showing an excess of expenditures overreceipts of $5,353,620. The excess of expenditures over receipts for theprevious year amounted to $6,437,992. The increase of revenues for 1869over those of 1868 was $2,051,909, and the increase of expenditures was$967,538. The increased revenue in 1869 exceeded the increased revenue in1868 by $996,336, and the increased expenditure in 1869 was $2,527,570 lessthan the increased expenditure in 1868, showing by comparison thisgratifying feature of improvement, that while the increase of expendituresover the increase of receipts in 1868 was $2,439,535, the increase ofreceipts over the increase of expenditures in 1869 was $1,084,371.Your attention is respectfully called to the recommendations made by thePostmaster General for authority to change the rate of compensation to themain trunk railroad lines for their services in carrying the mails; forhaving post route maps executed; for reorganizing and increasing theefficiency of the special agency service; for increase of the mail serviceon the Pacific, and for establishing mail service, under the flag of theUnion, on the Atlantic; and most especially do I call your attention to hisrecommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilege. This isan abuse from which no one receives a commensurate advantage; it reducesthe receipts for postal service from 25 to 30 per cent and largelyincreases the service to be performed. The method by which postage shouldbe paid upon public matter is set forth fully in the report of thePostmaster General.The report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the quantity ofpublic lands disposed of during the year ending the 30th of June, 1869, was7,666,152 acres, exceeding that of the preceding year by 1,010,409 acres.Of this amount 2,899,544 acres were sold for cash and 2,737,365 acresentered under the homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid in theconstruction of works of internal improvement, approved to the States asswamp land, and located with warrants and scrip. The cash receipts from allsources were $4,472,886, exceeding those of the preceding year $2,840,140.During the last fiscal year 23,196 names were added to the pension rollsand 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount paidto pensioners, including the compensation of disbursing agents, was$28,422,884, an increase of $4,411,902 on that of the previous year. Themunificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in itslegislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recentstruggle to maintain "that unity of government which makes us one people."The additions to the pension rolls of each successive year since theconclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeatedamendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1862, which extended itsprovisions to cases not falling within its original scope. The large outlaywhich is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowancebestowed since that date upon those who in the line of duty were wholly orpermanently disabled. Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction tothese measures of Congress, and it will be conceded that no part of ourpublic burden is more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by thisbranch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, inaddition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund, anappropriation of $30,000,000.During the year ending the 30th of September, 1869, the Patent Officeissued 13,762 patents, and its receipts were $686,389, being $213,926 morethan the expenditures.Messages and Papers of the Presidents, Ulysses S. Grant, vol. 6, p.3995I would respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of theSecretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising theeducation of freedmen with the other duties devolving upon the Commissionerof Education.If it is the desire of Congress to make the census which must be takenduring the year 1870 more complete and perfect than heretofore, I wouldsuggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress atthe last session appointed a committee to take into consideration suchmeasures as might be deemed proper in reference to the census and report aplan, I desist from saying more.I recommend to your favorable consideration the claims of the AgriculturalBureau for liberal appropriations. In a country so diversified in climateand soil as ours, and with a population so largely dependent uponagriculture, the benefits that can be conferred by properly fostering thisBureau are incalculable.I desire respectfully to call the attention of Congress to the inadequatesalaries of a number of the most important offices of the Government. Inthis message I will not enumerate them, but will specify only the justicesof the Supreme Court. No change has been made in their salaries for fifteenyears. Within that time the labors of the court have largely increased andthe expenses of living have at least doubled. During the same time Congresshas twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation of itsown members, and the duty which it owes to another department of theGovernment deserves, and will undoubtedly receive, its due consideration.There are many subjects not alluded to in this message which might withpropriety be introduced, but I abstain, believing that your patriotism andstatesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most conducive tothe interests of the whole people. On my part I promise a rigid adherenceto the laws and their strict enforcement.
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:A year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since thelast assembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, beenblessed with abundant crops, and have been spared from complications andwar with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has beenrestored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of theelective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizensin exceptional cases in several of the States lately in rebellion, and theverdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia,Mississippi, and Texas have been restored to representation in our nationalcouncils. Georgia, the only State now without representation, mayconfidently be expected to take her place there also at the beginning ofthe new year, and then, let us hope, will be completed the work ofreconstruction. With an acquiescence on the part of the whole people in thenational obligation to pay the public debt created as the price of ourUnion, the pensions to our disabled soldiers and sailors and their widowsand orphans, and in the changes to the Constitution which have been madenecessary by a great rebellion, there is no reason why we should notadvance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever didafter so protracted and devastating a war.Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe the protection of theUnited States minister in Paris was invoked in favor of North Germansdomiciled in French territory. Instructions were issued to grant theprotection. This has been followed by an extension of American protectionto citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Saxe Coburg, Gotha, Colombia, Portugal,Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay, and Venezuela inParis. The charge was an onerous one, requiring constant and severe labor,as well as the exercise of patience, prudence, and good judgment. It hasbeen performed to the entire satisfaction of this Government, and, as I amofficially informed, equally so to the satisfaction of the Government ofNorth Germany.As soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris and thatthe people of France had acquiesced in the change, the minister of theUnited States was directed by telegraph to recognize it and to tender mycongratulations and those of the people of the United States. Thereestablishment in France of a system of government disconnected with thedynastic traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper subject for thefelicitations of Americans. Should the present struggle result in attachingthe hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government,it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people. While wemake no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of othercountries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civilcontests elsewhere, we can not be indifferent to the spread of Americanpolitical ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France.We were asked by the new Government to use our good offices, jointly withthose of European powers, in the interests of peace. Answer was made thatthe established policy and the true interests of the United States forbadethem to interfere in European questions jointly with European powers. Iascertained, informally and unofficially, that the Government of NorthGermany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from anypower, and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restoredto the belligerents, with all of whom the United States are on terms offriendship, I declined on the part of this Government to take a step whichcould only result in injury to our true interests without advancing theobject for which our intervention was invoked. Should the time come whenthe action of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a singlehour, that action will be heartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view ofthe number of persons of German and French birth living in the UnitedStates, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had beenreceived from both belligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of theUnited States as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing withintheir territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. Thisproclamation was followed by others, as circumstances seemed to call forthem. The people, thus acquainted in advance of their duties andobligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality ofthe United States.It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba hasmaterially changed since the close of the last session of Congress. In anearly stage of the contest the authorities of Spain inaugurated a system ofarbitrary arrests, of close confinement, and of military trial andexecution of persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and ofsummary embargo of their properties, and sequestration of their revenues byexecutive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they affected the persons orproperty of citizens of the United States, were in violation of theprovisions of the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain.Representations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to becitizens of the United States by reason of such violations were made to theSpanish Government. From April, 1869, to June last the Spanish minister atWashington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing suchwrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn, "in view," as it was said,"of the favorable situation in which the island of Cuba" then "was," which,however, did not lead to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinaryand arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in Cuba, and wewere obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In the negotiations thusopened, and still pending there, the United States only claimed that forthe future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should berespected in Cuba, and that as to the past a joint tribunal should beestablished in the United States with full jurisdiction over all suchclaims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be requiredto prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverseevery material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case whichat one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the UnitedStates and Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of theowners of the Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detentionof that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and hasresulted in an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of$19,702.50 in gold. Another and long pending claim of like nature, that ofthe whaleship Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament duringthe present year. It was referred, by the joint consent of Brazil and theUnited States, to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, Her BritannicMajesty\'s minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious taskof examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submittedby the two Governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of$100,740.09 in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial Government.These recent examples show that the mode which the United States haveproposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible,and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to behoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without furtherdelay. Should the pending negotiations, unfortunately and unexpectedly, bewithout result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact toCongress and invite its action on the subject.The long deferred peace conference between Spain and the allied SouthAmerican Republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices ofthe United States. Pursuant to the recommendation contained in theresolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December, 1866,the executive department of the Government offered its friendly offices forthe promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied Republics.Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the offer.Ultimately, however, a conference was arranged, and was opened in this cityon the 29th of October last, at which I authorized the Secretary of Stateto preside. It was attended by the ministers of Spain, Peru, Chile, andEcuador. In consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia,the conference was adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary fromthat Republic could be secured or other measures could be adopted towardcompassing its objects.The allied and other Republics of Spanish origin on this continent may seein this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare, of ourdesire to see them blessed with good governments, capable of maintainingorder and of preserving their respective territorial integrity, and of oursincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them.The time is not probably far distant when, in the natural course of events,the European political connection with this continent will cease. Ourpolicy should be shaped, in view of this probability, so as to ally thecommercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to ourown, and thus give the United States all the preeminence and all theadvantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Clay contemplated when theyproposed to join in the congress of Panama.During the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of theRepublic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive therequisite two thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced thenthat the best interests of this country, commercially and materially,demanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed me in this view. I nowfirmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States haveentirely abandoned the project of accepting as a part of its territory theisland of San Domingo a free port will be negotiated for by Europeannations in the Bay of Samana. A large commercial city will spring up, towhich we will be tributary without receiving corresponding benefits, andthen will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great a prize. TheGovernment of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation. It is aweak power, numbering probably less than 120,000 souls, and yet possessingone of the richest territories under the sun, capable of supporting apopulation of 10,000,000 people in luxury. The people of San Domingo arenot capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and mustlook for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our freeinstitutions and laws, our progress and civilization. Shall we refusethem?The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographicalposition. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmustransit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capaciousharbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of theforests, mine, and soil of any of the West India Islands. Its possession byus will in a few years build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude,which will go far toward restoring to us our lost merchant marine. It willgive to us those articles which we consume so largely and do not produce,thus equalizing our exports and imports. In case of foreign war it willgive us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemyfrom ever again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. Atpresent our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic andthose bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and theAntilies. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to getby sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida.San Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resourcescan be developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands oflaborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of everyavailable means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seekthe blessings of freedom and its sequence each inhabitant receiving thereward of his own labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery,as a measure of self preservation, to retain their laborers.San Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farmsand manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnishedwith food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that contiguousislands should have the same advantages in order to compete in theproduction of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc. This will opento us a still wider market for our products. The production of our ownsupply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of ourannual imports, besides largely increasing our exports. With such a pictureit is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to beextinguished. With a balance of trade against us (including interest onbonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling inforeign lands) equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in thiscountry, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwiseaccomplished.The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the "Monroe doctrine;" itis a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim to acontrolling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow fromwest to east by way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up ourmerchant marine; it is to furnish new markets for the products of ourfarms, shops, and manufactories; it is to make slavery insupportable inCuba and Porto Rico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to settlethe unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict; it is toprovide honest means of paying our honest debts without overtaxing thepeople; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of everyday lifeat cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in fine, a rapid stridetoward that greatness which the intelligence, industry, and enterprise ofthe citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume amongnations.In view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Congressearly action expressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring SanDomingo. My suggestion is that by joint resolution of the two Houses ofCongress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotiate atreaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the acquisition of thatisland, and that an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such acommission. The question may then be determined, either by the action ofthe Senate upon the treaty or the joint action of the two Houses ofCongress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisitionof Texas. So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisitionof San Domingo, and of the great disadvantages I might almost saycalamities to flow from nonacquisition, that I believe the subject hasonly to be investigated to be approved.It is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the injuriouseffects, especially upon the revenue of the United States, of the policy ofthe Mexican Government in exempting from impost duties a large tract of itsterritory on our borders have not only been fruitless, but that it is evenproposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilegeadverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The expediency of taking into yourserious consideration proper measures for countervailing the policyreferred to will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention.It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provideagainst impunity to those who may have committed high crimes within theirborders and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extraditiontreaties have been concluded with several of the Central AmericanRepublics, and others are in progress.The sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon theproceedings of the commission on claims against Venezuela, as communicatedin my messages of March 16, 1869, March 1, 1870, and March 31, 1870. It hasnot been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has beenreceived from that Government until Congress shall have acted on thesubject.The massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien Tsin, undercircumstances of great barbarity, was supposed by some to have beenpremeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminateforeigners in the Chinese Empire. The evidence fails to establish such asupposition, but shows a complicity between the local authorities and themob. The Government at Peking, however, seems to have been disposed tofulfill its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do so.Unfortunately, the news of the war between the German States and Francereached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popularmind became possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to Chinesewaters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that thetime was coming when the superstitious masses might expel all foreignersand restore mandarin influence. Anticipating trouble from this cause, Iinvited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension ofhostilities in the East (where they were temporarily suspended by act ofthe commanders), and to act together for the future protection in China ofthe lives and properties of Americans and Europeans.Since the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty withGreat Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of theslave trade have been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is nowconfined to the eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken toArabian markets.The ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britainand the United States have also been exchanged during the recess, and thusa long standing dispute between the two Governments has been settled inaccordance with the principles always contended for by the United States.In April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation nearPembina, a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly receivedboundary line between the United States and the British possessions at thatplace is about 4,700 feet south of the true position of the forty ninthparallel, and that the line, when run on what is now supposed to be thetrue position of that parallel, would leave the fort of the Hudsons BayCompany at Pembina within the territory of the United States. Thisinformation being communicated to the British Government, I was requestedto consent, and did consent, that the British occupation of the fort of theHudsons Bay Company should continue for the present. I deem it important,however, that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed bya joint commission of the two Governments, and I submit herewith estimatesof the expense of such a commission on the part of the United States andrecommend that an appropriation be made for that purpose. The land boundaryhas already been fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountains tothe Georgian Bay. It should now be in like manner marked from the Lake ofthe Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment ofthe claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by thatGovernment during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its viewshave been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that HerMajesty\'s Government was guilty of any negligence, or did or permitted anyact during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint.Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. I thereforerecommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to takeproof of the amount and the ownership of these several claims, on notice tothe representative of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority begiven for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that theGovernment shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as theresponsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It can not benecessary to add that whenever Her Majesty\'s Government shall entertain adesire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims the United Stateswill enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusionconsistent with the honor and dignity of both nations.The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of theUnited States during the past season has not been marked by a friendlyfeeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between GreatBritain and the United States it was agreed that the inhabitants of theUnited States should have forever, in common with British subjects, theright of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters notincluded in the limits named in the convention (within 3 miles of parts ofthe British coast) it has been the custom for many years to give tointruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of theirviolation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial Governmentis understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction orcontrol of these inshore fishing grounds to the colonial authority known asthe Dominion of Canada, and this semi independent but irresponsible agenthas exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have beenseized without notice or warning, in violation of the custom previouslyprevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyagesbroken up, and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that thisunfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon thehardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect uponthis Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a stillbroader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the UnitedStates. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within3 marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canadainto port, to search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching thecargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if trueanswers are not given; and if such a vessel is found "preparing to fish"within 3 marine miles of any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or harborswithout a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the lastlicense granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, etc.,shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been madeunder this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it,it will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary to protectthe rights of the citizens of the United States.It has been claimed by Her Majesty\'s officers that the fishing vessels ofthe United States have no right to enter the open ports of the Britishpossessions in North America, except for the purposes of shelter andrepairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they haveno right to enter at the British custom houses or to trade there except inthe purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart withintwenty four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizureof a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been madeunder this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an alleged constructionof he convention of 1818, it can not be acquiesced in by the United States.It is hoped that it will not be insisted on by Her Majesty\'s Government.During the conferences which preceded the negotiation of the convention of1818 the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermenof the United States from "the privilege of carrying on trade with any ofHis Britannic Majesty\'s subjects residing within the limits assigned fortheir use;" and also that it should not be "lawful for the vessels of theUnited States engaged in said fishery to have on board any goods, wares, ormerchandise whatever, except such as may be necessary for the prosecutionof their voyages to and from the said fishing grounds: and any vessel ofthe United States which shall contravene this regulation may be seized,condemned, and confiscated, with her cargo."This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon thelanguage of the convention, was emphatically rejected by the Americancommissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the Britishplenipotentiaries, and Article I, as it stands in the convention, wassubstituted.If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial orcolonial statutes, and not upon the convention, this Government can not butregard them as unfriendly, and in contravention of the spirit, if not ofthe letter, of the treaty, for the faithful execution of which the ImperialGovernment is alone responsible.Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadianauthorities in the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts towardour fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power tosuspend by proclamation the operation of the laws authorizing the transitof goods, wares, and merchandise in bond across the territory of the UnitedStates to Canada, and, further, should such an extreme measure becomenecessary, to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of theDominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States.A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada inthe maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the UnitedStates from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes anatural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with an aggregate populationof about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367tons upon the waters which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of ourports on these waters is open to British competition, and the major part ofit is done in British bottoms.If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean,the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlanticwould be in foreign hands, their vessels on transatlantic voyages having anaccess to our lake ports which would be denied to American vessels onsimilar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice.During the Administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams Mr. Clay unanswerablydemonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to thenavigation of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of Viennain opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the judgment ofEuropean jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country throughwhich a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigationof that river to and into the sea, even though passing through theterritories of another power. This right does not exclude the coequal rightof the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouchesinto the sea to make such regulations relative to the police of thenavigation as may be reasonably necessary; but those regulations should beframed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not impose needlessburdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit. It has been foundin practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutualagreement. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangementas to the police of the St. Lawrence which may be suggested by GreatBritain.If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of Statesbordering on the shores of the Lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derivesgreater force and equity from the increased population, wealth, production,and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advancedhis argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he contendedhas been frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or bytreaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treatyconcluded at Mayence in 1831 the Rhine was declared free from the pointwhere it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spainand Portugal concluded in 1835 the navigation of the Douro throughout itswhole extent was made free for the subjects of both Crowns. In 1853 theArgentine Confederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of theParana and the Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 theCrimean War was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigationof the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia by treaty declared that it regarded therivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of nationallaw, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of allnations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December,1866, the Emperor of Brazil by imperial decree declared the Amazon to beopen to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. Thegreatest living British authority on this subject, while asserting theabstract right of the British claim, says: It seems difficult to deny thatGreat Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, but it is equallydifficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extremeand hard law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation ofthe St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with herconduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the groundthat she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise,she insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. Onthe ground that she possesses both banks of the St. Lawrence, where itdisembogues itself into the sea, she denies to the United States the rightof navigation, though about one half of the waters of Lakes Ontario. Erie,Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which theriver flows, are the property of the United States. The whole nation isinterested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States ofthe West to the Atlantic Seaboard. To the citizens of those States itsecures a greater return for their labor; to the inhabitants of theseaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation, an increase in the annualsurplus of wealth. It is hoped that the Government of Great Britain willsee the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to whichher Canadian Provinces have urged her adherence.Our depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your specialattention at the last session, and suggested that we will in the futurehave to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, forits revival. Our representatives to all these Governments have exertedtheir influence to encourage trade between the United States and thecountries to which they are accredited. But the fact exists that thecarrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this stateof affairs exists we can not control our due share of the commerce of theworld; that between the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all thecarrying trade now conducted in American vessels. I would recommend aliberal policy toward that line of American steamers one that will insureits success, and even increased usefulness.The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete withforeign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the UnitedStates than in foreign countries that without some assistance from theGovernment they can not be successfully built here. There will be severalpropositions laid before Congress in the course of the present sessionlooking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to theNational Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be given as will secureAmerican shipping on the high seas and American shipbuilding at home.The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for theearly action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department is afrail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion andfrom the other Departments, is ill adapted to the purpose for which it isused, has not capacity to accommodate the archives, and is not fireproof.Its remote situation, its slender construction, and the absence of a supplyof water in the neighborhood leave but little hope of safety for either thebuilding or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destructionwould involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts andresolutions of Congress, of the historic records of the Revolution and ofthe Confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archivessince the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other valuablerecords and papers left with that Department when it was the principaldepository of the governmental archives. I recommend an appropriation forthe construction of a building for the Department of State.I recommend to your consideration the propriety of transferring to theDepartment of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately tobelong, all powers and duties in relation to the Territories with which theDepartment of State is now charged by law or usage; and from the InteriorDepartment to the War Department the Pension Bureau, so far as it regulatesthe payment of soldiers\' pensions. I would further recommend that thepayment of naval pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the NavyDepartment.The estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal yearare $18,244,346.01 less than for the current one, but exceed theappropriations for the present year for the same items $8,972,127.56. Inthis estimate, however, is included $22,338,278.37 for public worksheretofore begun under Congressional provision, and of which only so muchis asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for the sameworks for the present fiscal year was $11,984,518.08.The average value of gold, as compared with national currency, for thewhole of the year 1869 was about 134, and for eleven months of 1870 thesame relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis isvery gratifying, but the fact can not be denied that the instability of thevalue of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keepup prices, to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated andfluctuating currency are so great that now, when the premium on gold hasfallen so much, it would seem that the time has arrived when by wise andprudent legislation Congress should look to a policy which would place ourcurrency at par with gold at no distant day.The tax collected from the people has been reduced more than $80,000,000per annum. By steadiness in our present course there is no reason why in afew short years the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the doorof the citizen almost entirely. With the revenue stamp dispensed bypostmasters in every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobaccoin all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put aduty only upon those articles which we could dispense with, known asluxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enoughmay be raised after a few years of peace and consequent reduction ofindebtedness to fulfill all our obligations. A further reduction ofexpenses, in addition to a reduction of interest account, may be relied onto make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it means this, has my heartysupport. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support ofthe Government, for the payment of principal and interest of the publicdebt, pensions, etc., by directly taxing the people, then I am againstrevenue reform, and confidently believe the people are with me. If it meansfailure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses ofGovernment, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then Iam still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform hasnot been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to beaccepted as something which is to supply every man\'s wants without any costor effort on his part.A true revenue reform can not be made in a day, but must be the work ofnational legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensedwith, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea and other articles ofuniversal use not produced by ourselves. The necessities of the countrycompel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors andcollectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but that of a tariff forrevenue is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts as an encouragementto home production, affords employment to labor at living wages, incontrast to the pauper labor of the Old World, and also in the developmentof home resources.Under the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870, the Army hasgradually been reduced, so that on the 1st day of January, 1871, the numberof commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated bythat law.The War Department building is an old structure, not fireproof, andentirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands ofdollars are now paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodatethe various bureaus of the Department. I recommend an appropriation for anew War Department building, suited to the present and growing wants of thenation.The report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction inthe expenses of the Army for the last fiscal year. For details you arereferred to his accompanying report.The expenses of the Navy for the whole of the last year i.e., fromDecember 1, 1869, the date of the last report are less than $19,000,000,or about $1,000,000 less than they were the previous year. The expensessince the commencement of this fiscal year i.e., since July 1 show forthe five months a decrease of over $2,400,000 from those of thecorresponding months last year. The estimates for the current year were$28,205,671.37. Those for next year are $20,683,317, with $955,100additional for necessary permanent improvements. These estimates are madeclosely for the mere maintenance of the naval establishment as now is,without much in the nature of permanent improvement. The appropriationsmade for the last and current years were evidently intended by Congress,and are sufficient only, to keep the Navy on its present footing by therepairing and refitting of our old ships.This policy must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the Navy, and itis in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued thenecessity for mere repairs in ships and navy yards becomes more imperativeand more costly, and our current expenses are annually increased for themere repair of ships, many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. Ihope during the present session of Congress to be able to submit to it aplan by which naval vessels can be built and repairs made with great savingupon the present cost.It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents acountry with over 5,000 miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive ofAlaska, and containing 40,000,000 progressive people, with relations ofevery nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with suchinadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy, either of protection orredress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern Continent,our Navy is our only means of direct protection to our citizens abroad orfor the enforcement of any foreign policy.The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a most satisfactoryworking of that Department. With the adoption of the recommendationscontained therein, particularly those relating to a reform in the frankingprivilege and the adoption of the "correspondence cards," a self sustainingpostal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a furtherreduction of the rate of postage be attained.I recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General andAttorney General to issue all commissions to officials appointed throughtheir respective Departments. At present these commissions, whereappointments are Presidential, are issued by the State Department. The lawin all the Departments of Government, except those of the Post Office andof Justice, authorizes each to issue its own commissions.Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention toone abuse of long standing which I would like to see remedied by thisCongress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would haveit go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks andemployees who do not require "the advice and consent of the Senate" to maketheir appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the tenure, butthe manner of making all appointments. There is no duty which so muchembarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as that of appointments,nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators andRepresentatives as that of finding places for constituents. The presentsystem does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men, for publicplace. The elevation and purification of the civil service of theGovernment will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the UnitedStates.Reform in the management of Indian affairs has received the specialattention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present day.The experiment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few agenciesgiven to the denomination of Friends, and has been found to work mostadvantageously. All agencies and superintendencies not so disposed of weregiven to officers of the Army. The act of Congress reducing the Armyrenders army officers ineligible for civil positions. Indian agencies beingcivil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such religiousdenominations as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians,and perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the work on thesame terms i.e., as a missionary work. The societies selected are allowedto name their own agents, subject to the approval of the Executive, and areexpected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries, to Christianizeand civilize the Indian, and to train him in the arts of peace. TheGovernment watches over the official acts of these agents, and requires ofthem as strict an accountability as if they were appointed in any othermanner. I entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will ina few years bring all the Indians upon reservations, where they will livein houses, and have schoolhouses and churches, and will be pursuingpeaceful and self sustaining avocations, and where they may be visited bythe law abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits thecivilized white settlements. I call your special attention to the report ofthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full information on this subject.During the last fiscal year 8,095,413 acres of public land were disposedof. Of this quantity 3,698,910.05 acres were taken under the homestead lawand 2,159,515.81 acres sold for cash. The remainder was located withmilitary warrants, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction ofgrants to railroads or for other public uses. The entries under thehomestead law during the last year covered 961,545 acres more than thoseduring the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to thefull extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land inmarket will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settler underthe homestead or the preemption laws is not, however, limited to landssubject to sale at private entry. Any unappropriated surveyed public landmay, to a limited amount, be acquired under the former laws if the partyentitled to enter under them will comply with the requirements theyprescribe in regard to the residence and cultivation. The actual settler\'spreference right of purchase is even broader, and extends to lands whichwere unsurveyed at the time of his settlement. His right was formerlyconfined within much narrower limits, and at one period of our history wasconferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from time to time tolegalize what was then regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon thenational domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regardedchiefly as a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapidsettlement and successful cultivation of them are now justly considered ofmore importance to our well being than is the fund which the sale of themwould produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new States andTerritories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invites the tillerof the soil to secure a permanent home on terms within the reach of all.The pioneer who incurs the dangers and privations of a frontier life, andthus aids in laying the foundation of new commonwealths, renders a signalservice to his country, and is entitled to its special favor andprotection. These laws secure that object and largely promote the generalwelfare. They should therefore be cherished as a permanent feature of ourland system.Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. Thetime honored and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections ofpublic land for educational purposes in the new States should be continued.When ample provision shall have been made for these objects, I submit as aquestion worthy of serious consideration whether the residue of ournational domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provisions thehomestead and preemption laws.In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States inwhich they are situated, the lands taken under the agricultural collegeacts and for internal improvement purposes under the act of September,1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed up to theclose of the last fiscal year, by patent or other equivalent title, toStates and corporations 27,836,257.63 acres for railways, canals, and wagonroads. It is estimated that an additional quantity of 174,735,523 acres isstill due under grants for like uses. The policy of thus aiding the Statesin building works of internal improvement was inaugurated more than fortyyears since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois, to aid those States inopening canals to connect the waters of the Wabash with those of Lake Erieand the waters of the Illinois with those of Lake Michigan. It wasfollowed, with some modifications, in the grant to Illinois of alternatesections of public land within certain limits of the Illinois CentralRailway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similarsubsidies in connection with railways completed or in process ofconstruction. As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, thesale of them at the enhanced price has thus in many instances indemnifiedthe Treasury for the granted lands. The construction of some of thesethoroughfares has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the developmentof our resources and the settlement of the more distant portions of thecountry. It may, however, be well insisted that much of our legislation inthis regard has been characterized by indiscriminate and profuseliberality. The United States should not loan their credit in aid of anyenterprise undertaken by States or corporations, nor grant lands in anyinstance, unless the projected work is of acknowledged national importance.I am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient andunnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description; but should Congressdetermine otherwise I earnestly recommend that the right of settlers and ofthe public be more effectually secured and protected by appropriatelegislation.During the year ending September 30, 1870, there were filed in the PatentOffice 19,411 applications for patents, 3,374 caveats, and 160 applicationsfor the extension of patents. Thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty twopatents, including reissues and designs, were issued, 1,010 extended, and1,089 allowed, but not issued by reason of the nonpayment of the finalfees. The receipts of the office during the year were $136,304.29 in excessof its expenditures.The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted. Thepreliminary report, containing much information of special value andinterest, will be ready for delivery during the present session. Theremaining volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent withperfect accuracy in arranging and classifying the returns. We shall thus atno distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our condition andresources. It will, I doubt not, attest the growing prosperity of thecountry, although during the decade which has just closed it was soseverely tried by the great war waged to maintain its integrity and tosecure and perpetuate our free institutions.During the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners, including the costof disbursement, was $27,780,811.11, and 1,758 bounty land warrants wereissued. At its close 198,686 names were on the pension rolls.The labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutinyof the evidence submitted in favor of new claims and to the discovery offictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed. The appropriation forthe employment of special agents for the investigation of frauds has beenjudiciously used, and the results obtained have been of unquestionablebenefit to the service.The subjects of education and agriculture are of great interest to thesuccess of our republican institutions, happiness, and grandeur as anation. In the interest of one a bureau has been established in theInterior Department the Bureau of Education; and in the interest of theother, a separate Department, that of Agriculture. I believe great generalgood is to flow from the operations of both these Bureaus if properlyfostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too highly thereports of the Commissioners of Education and of Agriculture, nor urge toostrongly such liberal legislation as to secure their efficiency.In conclusion I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be athorough enforcement of every law; a faithful collection of every taxprovided for; economy in the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment ofevery debt of the nation; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as therequirements of the country will admit; reductions of taxation and tariff,to be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number;honest and fair dealings with all other peoples, to the end that war, withall its blighting consequences, may be avoided, but without surrenderingany right or obligation due to us; a reform in the treatment of Indians andin the whole civil service of the country; and, finally, in securing apure, untrammeled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may doso, just once at each election, without fear of molestation or proscriptionon account of his political faith, nativity, of color.
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In addressing my third annual message to the law making branch of theGovernment it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past yearsuccess has generally attended the effort to execute all laws found uponthe statute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom oflaws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforcethem accordingly.The past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperityto the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than usualchastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. Thesedisasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature inour country and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreignnations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses occasioned bythese calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously shared their meanswith the victims of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in theconsciousness of having performed a noble act and in receiving the gratefulthanks of men, women, and children whose sufferings they have relieved.The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to befriendly. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two greatnations, speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by peacefularbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring thosenations into bloody and costly conflict. An example has thus been setwhich, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilizednations, and finally be the means of returning to productive industrymillions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by thebayonet and the broadside.I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has beenconcluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, anda copy of the protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by whom itwas negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questionspending between the two nations.Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend Congressat an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Genevaand for the several commissioners on the part of the United States calledfor by the treaty.His Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation,and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each consented, on the jointrequest of the two powers, to name an arbiter for the tribunal at Geneva. Ihave caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with whichthe joint request has been complied with, by the appointment of gentlemenof eminence and learning to these important positions.His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with thejoint request of the two Governments, and has consented to act as thearbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States andGreat Britain.The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as betweenthemselves certain principles of public law, for which the United Stateshave contended from the commencement of their history. They have alsoagreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the other maritimepowers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on asto the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to theother powers.I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States tobring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheriesand to the other matters touching the relations of the United States towardthe British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as theproper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and itspossessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may becomeoperative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make theirarrangements for the coming season.I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith,to the governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those States,respectively, the necessary action on their part to carry into effect theobject of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of thecanals, on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes andrivers forming the boundary, on terms of equality, by the inhabitants ofboth countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object and thebenefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislativesanction of the States concerned.I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the trueposition of the forty ninth parallel of latitude where it forms theboundary between the United States and the British North Americanpossessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the RockyMountains. The early action of Congress on this recommendation would put itin the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during thenext summer.The resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Germany hasenabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extendedto Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representatives of theUnited States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty ofthis protection has been performed by the minister and the consul generalat Paris, and the various consuls in France under the supervision of thelatter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their coursehas received the commendation of the German Government, and has wounded nosusceptibility of the French.The Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendlyfeeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with themoderate and just policy which this Government maintains in its relationswith Asiatic powers, as well as with the South American Republics. I havegiven assurances that the friendly feelings of that Government are fullyshared by the United States.The ratifications of the consular and naturalization conventions with theAustro Hungarian Empire have been exchanged.I have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of theChurch to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of thatKingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy of the UnitedStates, I have recognized this change. The ratifications of the new treatyof commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged. Thetwo powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea shall beexempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The UnitedStates have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into theobligation of nations.The Forty first Congress, at its third session, made an appropriation forthe organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims ofcitizens of the United States against Spain growing out of the insurrectionin Cuba. That commission has since been organized. I transmit herewith thecorrespondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to behoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy fortheir injuries.It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over aconference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and theallied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistice, withthe reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between theUnited States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third sonof the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of hisGovernment to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitablereception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on ourside we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of theRussian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall andto decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomaticrepresentative. It was impossible, with self respect or with a just regardto the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to holdintercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of Governmentofficials, and during his persistent interferences, through various means,with the relations between the United States and other powers. Inaccordance with my wishes, this Government has been relieved of furtherintercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of theimperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirelyunobjectionable.With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The cabinet of theMikado has since the close of the last session of Congress selectedcitizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in severaldepartments of Government. I have reason to think that this selection isdue to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which theUnited States have pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue tomaintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan.The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no dispositionon the part of this Government to swerve from its established course.Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of ourshipwrecked sailors on the Korean coast, I instructed our minister atPeking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Korea for securing thesafety and humane treatment of such mariners.Admiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force toprotect him in case of need.A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast was treacherouslyattacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation andapology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After anarduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which theoutrages had been committed were reduced by a gallant assault and weredestroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated thehonor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable underthe circumstances to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully referto the correspondence relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leave thesubject for such action as Congress may see fit to take.The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable lawsestablishing what is known as the "free zone" on the frontier of the UnitedStates. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more stringentmeasures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persons onits frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon relieve thisGovernment of the difficulties experienced from these causes.Our relations with the various Republics of Central and South Americacontinue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly.I recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installmentsunder the award of the Venezuelan Claims Commission of 1866. The internaldissensions of this Government present no justification for the absence ofeffort to meet their solemn treaty obligations.The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has beenexchanged.It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil hastaken the initiatory step toward the abolition of slavery. Our relationswith that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by thisact. It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafterfind it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance towardentire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates.The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in theelevation and education of its laborers.It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which werevoluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out inits West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparentabolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers inbondage, with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to theiremployers.I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the UnitedStates, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, are largeholders in foreign lands of this species of property, forbidden by thefundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress toprovide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the holding,owning or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave property, inforeign lands, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagors, by citizens of theUnited States.It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cubacontinues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of aprotracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, withoutapparent prospect of an early termination, can not be other than an objectof concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in theaffairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in theundisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of freeinstitutions.Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case itshould become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives andproperty of bona fide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of theflag.It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of theaffairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliationwhich has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of suchquestions.To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomaticrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the goodopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share ofthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of thecommercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made tosupport at least four American youths in each of those countries, to serveas a part of the official family of our ministers there. Ourrepresentatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with therepresentatives of Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated,our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters andtranslators upon natives of those countries who know our languageimperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees inforeign business houses or the interpreters to other foreign ministers.I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting theAmerican lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan andChina, and the Australian line almost our only remaining lines of oceansteamers and of increasing their services.The national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057, 126.80 duringthe year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate ofinterest the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished thatnow the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000,000less than on the 1st of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that thisrapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of thecountry and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet everydollar of liability without bankrupting them. But in view of theaccomplishment of these desirable ends: of the rapid development of theresources of the country; its increasing ability to meet large demands, andthe amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources ofthe country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapidpayment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff andinternal tax law. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources beabolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous, and maltliquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps.In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of theamount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providingfor the current expenses of the Government, the interest count, and asinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as toafford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articlesnot produced at home, but which enter largely into general consumptionthrough articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicinescompounded, etc., etc., from which very little revenue is derived, butwhich enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed onthe "free list." Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would thenrecommend that it be made upon those articles which can best bear itwithout disturbing home production or reducing the wages of Americanlabor.I have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat whatwill be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. Thepresent laws for collecting revenue pay collectors of customs smallsalaries, but provide for moieties (shares in all seizures), which, atprincipal ports of entry particularly, raise the compensation of thoseofficials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system mustat times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men,should such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny ofgoods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Yourattention is respectfully invited to this subject.Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the nationalcurrency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development ofthe country, in keeping up prices of all articles necessary in everydaylife. It fosters a spirit of gambling, prejudicial alike to national moralsand the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get afixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformlyapproaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained.For the operations of the Army in the past year, the expense of maintainingit, the estimate for the ensuing year, and for continuing seacoast andother improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department, Irefer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War.I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approvedMarch 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the Armyuntil provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in eachgrade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any onegrade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled bypromotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office ofchief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by selection fromthe corps in which the vacancy exists.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the numberand efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expenseof supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and isbeing extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vesselsas cruisers on the several stations. By this means we have been enabled tooccupy at once a larger extent of cruising grounds, to visit morefrequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable, andgenerally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the Navyin time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditureauthorized by law.During the past year the Navy has, in addition to its regular service,supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey, and hascompleted the surveys authorized by Congress of the isthmuses of Darien andTehuantepec, and, under like authority, has sent out an expedition,completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of thenorth.The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing andimproving the materiel of the Navy, and the plan recommended for reducingthe personnel of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolitionof certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employmentof some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered anddeserve the thoughtful attention of Congress.I also recommend that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of captainbe by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in thehigher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to youngofficers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession.The present cost of maintaining the Navy, its cost compared with that ofthe preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained inthe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy.The enlarged receipts of the Post Office Department, as shown by theaccompanying report of the Postmaster General, exhibit a gratifyingincrease in that branch of the public service. It is the index of thegrowth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elementshighly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vastterritory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring theservices of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that thisDepartment can be made self sustaining. But a gradual approach to this endfrom year to year is confidently relied on, and the day is not far distantwhen the Post Office Department of the Government will prove a much greaterblessing to the whole people than it is now.The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in theDepartment presided over by him are earnestly recommended to you, specialattention. Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of the planfor uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postalsystem. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing couldbe much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It wouldsecure the further advantage of extending the telegraph through portions ofthe country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce,trade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated intoa community of interest are always benefited by a rapid intercommunication.Education, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged byincreasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of thecountry. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulateeducation. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for fulldetails of the operations of last year and for comparative statements ofresults with former years.There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government theexecution of the act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonlyknown as the Kuklux law, in a portion of the State of South Carolina. Thenecessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of theCommittee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Under the provisions of theabove act I issued a proclamation calling the attention of the people ofthe United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise anyof the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case ofimperative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powerswhenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing toall citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rightsguaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws.After the passage of this law information was received from time to timethat combinations of the character referred to in this law existed and werepowerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certaincounties in the State of South Carolina.Careful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in ninecounties of that State such combinations were active and powerful,embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the localauthority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving theemancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of preventingthe free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize withtheir own views. Among their operations were frequent scourgings andoccasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguisedpersons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of differentpolitical sentiments from their own or freed persons who had shown adisposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands ofinoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawlessviolence,Thereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, a proclamation was issued, interms of the law, calling upon the members of those combinations todisperse within five days and to deliver to the marshal or militaryofficers of the United States all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises,and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawfulpurposes.This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October anotherproclamation was issued, suspending the privileges of the writ of habeascorpus in nine counties in that State.Direction was given that within the counties so designated personssupposed, upon creditable information, to be members of such unlawfulcombinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United Statesand delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with according to law. In two ofsaid counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests have been made. At thelast account the number of persons thus arrested was 168. Several hundred,whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, werereleased for the present. These have generally made confessions of theirguilt.Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and,notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person isnow in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in thejudicial tribunals of the United States.As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were aboutto take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, andthere is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violatedthe law. A full report of what has been done under this law will besubmitted to Congress by the Attorney General.In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant tocivilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorialofficers, however, have been found who are willing to perform their duty ina spirit of equity and with a due sense of the necessity of sustaining themajesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other violation of existingstatutes will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It isnot with the religion of the self styled Saints that we are now dealing,but with their practices. They will be protected in the worship of Godaccording to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not bepermitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion.It may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in the execution of thelaws against polygamy, is to be the status of plural wives and theiroffspring. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizingthe Territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born priorto a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to theseinnocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation.The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as canbe judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation.Through the exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom hasbeen intrusted the execution of the policy, and the board of commissionersauthorized by the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of Indians have beeninduced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to performproductive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization.They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce thosestill pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunitywhich is left them to avoid extermination.I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy,not only because it is humane, Christian like, and economical, but becauseit is right.I recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting aTerritorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west ofArkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so every rightguaranteed to the Indian by treaty should be secured. Such a course mightin time be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between theMissouri and the Pacific and south of the British possessions into oneTerritory or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has treated upon thissubject at length, and I commend to you his suggestions.I renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritageto our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and toactual settlers. Those already granted have been in great part disposed ofin such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler whomay wish to avail himself of them, but caution should be exercised even inattaining so desirable an object.Educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of thesale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood asrecommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by theGeneral Government for the encouragement of education.The report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will giveyou all the information collected and prepared for publication in regard tothe census taken during the year 1870; the operations of the Bureau ofEducation for the year; the Patent Office; the Pension Office; the LandOffice, and the Indian Bureau.The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of hisDepartment for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of ourprosperity, too much importance can not be attached to the labors of thisDepartment. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants, allzealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of thenation all useful products adapted to any of the various climates and soilsof our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to themethod of cultivation, the plants, cereals, and other products adapted toparticular localities. Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bureau isworking a great national good, and if liberally supported the more widelyits influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon theproducts of foreign countries.The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials holdingpositions of responsibility, and requiring ability and character to fillproperly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of theofficials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of afamily, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest. Inprivate life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered; awise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service.I have not given the estimates for the support of Government for theensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures forthe year just passed and the one just preceding, because all these figuresare contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly toCongress. These estimates have my approval.More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was firedbetween the armies then arrayed against each other one for theperpetuation, the other for the destruction, of the Union it may well beconsidered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by thefourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude theballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon certainclasses. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure toelect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see theadvantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because theywere before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to beelected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support theConstitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely thesame views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said thatthe former violated an oath, while the latter did not; the latter did nothave it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath, it can not bedoubted they would have broken it as did the former class. If there are anygreat criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took inopposition to the Government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, beexcluded from such an amnesty.This subject is submitted for your careful consideration.The condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all truepatriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion\'s sake,personal violence or threats toward persons entertaining political viewsopposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, preventsimmigration and the flow of much needed capital into the States lately inrebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country when the oldcitizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs,promulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing theirviews, and tolerate the same freedom of expression and ballot in thoseentertaining different political convictions.Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21, 1871, aTerritorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Itsresults have thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates.Under the direction of the Territorial officers, a system of improvementshas been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming acity worthy of the nation\'s capital. The citizens of the District havingvoluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose ofcontributing to the adornment of the seat of Government, I recommendliberal appropriations on the part of Congress, in order that theGovernment may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out ajudicious system of improvements.By the great fire in Chicago the most important of the Government buildingsin that city were consumed. Those burned had already become inadequate tothe wants of the Government in that growing city, and, looking to the nearfuture, were totally inadequate. I recommend, therefore, that anappropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the squareon which the burned buildings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fairvaluation, or provided that the legislature of Illinois will pass a lawauthorizing its condemnation for Government purposes; and also anappropriation of as much money as can properly be expended toward theerection of new buildings during this fiscal year.The number of immigrants ignorant of our laws, habits, etc., coming intoour country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced uponthem so numerous and flagrant that I suggest Congressional action for theirprotection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made byimmigrants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so duringthe session of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive yourattention.It has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiencyin all public offices. Every public servant who has violated the trustplaced in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. Ifbad men have secured places, it has been the fault of the systemestablished by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault ofthose who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently wellknown to them personally, or who give letters indorsing the characters ofoffice seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility whichsuch a course devolves upon them. A civil service reform which can correctthis abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man whogives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain creditfrom a stranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of hisfriend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law whichwould enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for publicplace would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutarylesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in thegreat number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking placethroughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have provenrecreant to the trusts confided to them and in elevating to public officenone but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the virtuous,who, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the community inwhich they live.In my message to Congress one year ago I urgently recommended a reform inthe civil service of the country. In conformity with that recommendationCongress, in the ninth section of "An act making appropriations for sundrycivil expenses of the Government, and for other purposes," approved March3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate acivil service reform, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so.Under the authority of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminentlyqualified for the work to devise rules and regulations to effect the neededreform. Their labors are not yet complete, but it is believed that theywill succeed in devising a plan that can be adopted to the great relief ofthe Executive, the heads of Departments, and members of Congress, and whichwill redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events, theexperiment shall have a fair trial.I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during thelast year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for yourconsideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined actionwill be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best interests of the wholecountry.
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In transmitting to you this my fourth annual message it is withthankfulness to the Giver of All Good that as a nation we have been blessedfor the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a generalprosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples.With the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from theearth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the cityof Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the year torecord. It is gratifying to note how, like their fellow citizens of thecity of Chicago under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens ofBoston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that theirenergy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles and show the sameprosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise wehave been free from pestilence, war, and calamities, which often overtakenations; and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no causeseems to exist to threaten our present peace.When Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised by GreatBritain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperiled thesettlement by friendly arbitration of the grave differences between thisGovernment and that of Her Britannic Majesty, which by the treaty ofWashington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which had metat Geneva, in Switzerland.The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeoparded thewhole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in mostunhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory tothis Government and in accordance with the views and the policy which ithad maintained.The tribunal, which had convened at Geneva in December, concluded itslaborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, havingavailed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty toaward a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of$15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to theUnited States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to itsconsideration.This decision happily disposes of a long standing difference between thetwo Governments, and, in connection with another award, made by the GermanEmperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these twoGovernments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is mysincere hope may forever remain equally unclouded.The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Genevatribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of thearbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both Governments, the award ofthe tribunal, and the opinions given by the several arbitrators, istransmitted herewith.I have caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powerswho complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty thethanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by themrespectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them,and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and greatability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions.Her Majesty\'s Government has communicated to me the appreciation by HerMajesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams,the arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the protractedinquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite with HerMajesty in this appreciation.It is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to recordmy high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and theprudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsibleand delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned andeminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government toexpress my sense of the talents and wisdom which they brought to bear inthe attainment of the result so happily reached.It will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution amongthose who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money tobe paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the dateof the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making aproper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may bedue. I consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners forthe purpose.By the thirty fourth article of the treaty of Washington the respectiveclaims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction ofthe treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, defining the boundary line betweentheir respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration and awardof His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of those claims ismost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846.His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake thearbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people ofthe United States for the labor, pains, and care which he has devoted tothe consideration of this long pending difference. I have caused anexpression of my thanks to be communicated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,the representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case andprepared the statement on the part of the United States with the abilitythat his past services justified the public in expecting at his hands. As amember of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to thediscussion between the two Governments, as the minister to Great Britainwhen the construction now pronounced unfounded was first advanced, and asthe agent and representative of the Government to present the case and toreceive the award, he has been associated with the question in all of itsphases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestnessin maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to muchcredit for the success which has attended the submission.After a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of eachparty, His Majesty the Emperor, on the 21st day of October last, signed hisaward in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the UnitedStates, that the boundary line between the territories of Her BritannicMajesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro Channel, ismost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded onthe 15th of June, 1846, between the Governments of Her Britannic Majestyand of the United States.Copies of the "case" presented on behalf of each Government, and of the"statement in reply" of each, and a translation of the award, aretransmitted herewith.This award confirms the United States in their claim to the importantarchipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouvers Island,which for more than twenty six years (ever since the ratification of thetreaty) Great Britain has contested, and leaves us, for the first time inthe history of the United States as a nation, without a question ofdisputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of GreatBritain on this continent.It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action of HerMajesty\'s Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of anyrequest from this Government, and before the reception in the United Statesof the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions forthe removal of her troops which had been stationed there and for thecessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave theUnited States in the exclusive possession of the lately disputed territory.I am gratified to be able to announce that the orders for the removal ofthe troops have been executed, and that the military joint occupation ofSan Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of theUnited States.It now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of thatportion of the boundary line (through the Haro Channel) upon which thecommission which determined the remaining part of the line were unable toagree. I recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with onewhich may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose.Experience of the difficulties attending the determination of our admittedline of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlementby those owing allegiance to the respective Governments, points to theimportance of establishing, by natural objects or other monuments, theactual line between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and theadjoining possessions of Her Britannic Majesty. The region is now sosparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or ofjurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of theactual location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter andoccupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array thetwo Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of acommission, to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part ofGreat Britain, to determine the line between our Territory of Alaska andthe conterminous possessions of Great Britain.In my last annual message I recommended the legislation necessary on thepart of the United States to bring into operation the articles of thetreaty of Washington of May 8, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to othermatters touching the relations of the United States toward the BritishNorth American possessions, to become operative so soon as the properlegislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and itspossessions.That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had notthen been had, and during the session of Congress a question was raisedwhich for the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in thedirection indicated would become important. This question has since beendisposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament andthe legislatures of the provincial governments have passed laws to carrythe provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into operation. Itherefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the samedirection necessary on the part of this Government.The joint commission for determining the boundary line between the UnitedStates and the British possessions between the Lake of the Woods and theRocky Mountains has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirablethat the force be increased, in order that the completion of the survey anddetermination of the line may be the sooner attained. To this end Irecommend that a sufficient appropriation be made.With France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend ofthe United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have somany causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the otherpowers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms.Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of theratifications of a treaty with the Austro Hungarian Empire relating tonaturalization; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consulsand trade marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating tonaturalization; all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed.Congress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray theexpense of commissioners on the part of the United States to theInternational Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons appointedin that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessionsof the congress. Their report shall in due season be laid before you. Thiscongress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessionsin several of the countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration thepropriety of extending an invitation to the congress to hold its nextmeeting in the United States. The Centennial Celebration to be held in 1876would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting.Preparations are making for the international exposition to be held duringthe next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendencyof these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization, and ofthe elevation of industry and of labor, and of the increase of humanhappiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations.As this exposition is to be the first which will have been held in easternEurope, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will beready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of theirproductions if encouraged by proper aid and protection.At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment ofone or more agents to represent this Government at the exposition. Theauthority thus given has been exercised, but, in the absence of anyappropriation, there is danger that the important benefits which theoccasion offers will in a large degree be lost to citizens of the UnitedStates. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, and recommendthat an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose.To further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I wouldrecommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary ofthe Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between ourAtlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna, andback, their articles for exhibition.Since your last session the President of the Mexican Republic,distinguished by his high character and by his services to his country, hasdied. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity bythe people a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdomwhich it is believed will be confirmed by the results of hisadministration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be leftundone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen their relationsas neighbors and friends.It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb thequiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that ofMexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in various partsof the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which theneighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some degreecontributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settledrule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the presentGovernment, the acts of which just complaint is made will cease.The proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately, beenchecked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been takenby the two Governments which it is believed will prove successful.The commissioners appointed, pursuant to the joint resolution of Congressof the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the Texan frontierhave diligently made investigations in that quarter. Their report upon thesubject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarilyincomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriation made byCongress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similarcommission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially,but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation isdesired, and that the cooperation of all parties concerned is invited tosecure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be madeat the earliest day practicable, to enable the commissioners on the part ofthe United States to return to their labors without delay.It is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance of thedisturbed condition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward thepacification of the discontented part of the population has been made.While the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no more of theelements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than wereexhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in itsrepression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitudewhich they have occupied for a long time past.This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were its scene at adistance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result,although humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents whereverthey might occur. It is, however, at our door.I can not doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is amongthe strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terriblewrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery andthe introduction of other reforms in the administration of government inCuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It isgreatly to be hoped that the present liberal Government of Spain willvoluntarily adopt this view.The law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, hasremained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. Itwas but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition ofright, and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony withsentiments of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other powersof the Christian and civilized world.Within the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law ofemancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity ofintention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. Ihave not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, andthe justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evilwhich oppresses a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest closeto our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of concedingreforms of which the propriety is not questioned.Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is oneof the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition inCuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or thoseclaiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed asproperty, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the UnitedStates. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws,contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest.In my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommendsuch legislation as may be proper to denounce, and, if not prevent, atleast to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves.It is gratifying to announce that the ratifications of the conventionconcluded under the auspices of this Government between Spain on the onepart and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for anarmistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewithsubmitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peacebetween the same parties.The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peacebetween Brazil and the Argentine Republic it is hoped are in the way ofsatisfactory adjustment.With these States, as with the Republics of Central and of South America,we continue to maintain the most friendly relations.It is with regret, however, I announce that the Government of Venezuela hasmade no further payments on account of the awards under the convention ofthe 25th of April, 1866. That Republic is understood to be now almost, ifnot quite, tranquilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no timein providing for the unpaid balance of its debt to the United States,which, having originated in injuries to our citizens by Venezuelanauthorities, and having been acknowledged, pursuant to a treaty, in themost solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preferenceover debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. Thissubject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such actionas may be deemed proper.Our treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An imposing embassy fromthat interesting and progressive nation visited this country during theyear that is passing, but, being unprovided with powers for the signing ofa convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction was reached.It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions which took placeduring their stay in this country has led to a mutual appreciation of theinterests which may be promoted when the revision of the existing treatyshall be undertaken.In this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, that To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomaticrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the goodopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share ofthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of thecommercial world, an appropriation be made to support at least fourAmerican youths in each of those countries, to serve as a part of theofficial family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not eventhen be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britainand of some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan andChina have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of thosecountries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasionthe services of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters toother foreign ministers.I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion, of the transfer tothe Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately tobelong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the Territories withwhich the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom.Congress from the beginning of the Government has wisely made provision forthe relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision,however, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distressabroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with othergovernments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens orsubjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation tocarry it into effect are recommended in the case of citizens of the UnitedStates destitute or sick under such circumstances. It is well known thatsuch citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most ofthem are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are somewho, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friendsat home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish,cast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or be relieved at theprivate charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the mostbenevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes.Should the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will betaken so to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect that it shall notbe unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed. TREASURY.The moneys received and covered into the Treasury during the fiscal yearended June 30, 1872, were:From customs   $216,370,286.77From sales of public lands   2,575,714.19From internal revenue   130,642,177.72From tax on national bank circulation, etc   6,523,396.39From Pacific railway companies   749,861.87From customs fines, etc   1,136,442.34From fees consular, patent, lands, etc   2,284,095.92From miscellaneous   412,254.71  
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The year that has passed since the submission of my last message toCongress has, especially during the latter part of it, been an eventful oneto the country. In the midst of great national prosperity a financialcrisis has occurred that has brought low fortunes of gigantic proportions;political partisanship has almost ceased to exist, especially in theagricultural regions; and, finally, the capture upon the high seas of avessel bearing our flag has for a time threatened the most seriousconsequences, and has agitated the public mind from one end of the countryto the other. But this, happily, now is in the course of satisfactoryadjustment, honorable to both nations concerned.The relations of the United States, however, with most of the other powerscontinue to be friendly and cordial. With France, Germany, Russia, Italy,and the minor European powers; with Brazil and most of the South AmericanRepublics, and with Japan, nothing has occurred during the year to demandspecial notice. The correspondence between the Department of State andvarious diplomatic representatives in or from those countries istransmitted herewith.In executing the will of Congress, as expressed in its joint resolution ofthe 14th of February last, and in accordance with the provisions of theresolution, a number of "practical artisans," of "scientific men," and of"honorary commissioners" were authorized to attend the exposition at Viennaas commissioners on the part of the United States. It is believed that wehave obtained the object which Congress had in view when it passed thejoint resolution "in order to enable the people of the United States toparticipate in the advantages of the International Exhibition of theProducts of Agriculture, Manufactures, and the Fine Arts to be held atVienna." I take pleasure in adding that the American exhibitors havereceived a gratifying number of diplomas and of medals.During the exposition a conference was held at Vienna for the purpose ofconsultation on the systems prevailing in different countries for theprotection of inventions. I authorized a representative from the PatentOffice to be present at Vienna at the time when this conference was to takeplace, in order to aid as far as he might in securing any possibleadditional protection to American inventors in Europe. The report of thisagent will be laid before Congress.It is my pleasant duty to announce to Congress that the Emperor of China,on attaining his majority, received the diplomatic representatives of theWestern powers in person. An account of these ceremonies and of theinteresting discussions which preceded them will be found in the documentstransmitted herewith. The accompanying papers show that some advance,although slight, has been made during the past year toward the suppressionof the infamous Chinese cooly trade. I recommend Congress to inquirewhether additional legislation be not needed on this subject.The money awarded to the United States by the tribunal of arbitration atGeneva was paid by Her Majesty\'s Government a few days in advance of thetime when it would have become payable according to the terms of thetreaty. In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1873, itwas at once paid into the Treasury, and used to redeem, so far as it might,the public debt of the United States; and the amount so redeemed wasinvested in a 5 per cent registered bond of the United States for$15,500,000, which is now held by the Secretary of State, subject to thefuture disposition of Congress.I renew my recommendation, made at the opening of the last session ofCongress, that a commission be created for the purpose of auditing anddetermining the amounts of the several "direct losses growing out of thedestruction of vessels and their cargoes" by the Alabama, the Florida, orthe Shenandoah after leaving Melbourne, for which the sufferers havereceived no equivalent or compensation, and of ascertaining the names ofthe persons entitled to receive compensation for the same, making thecomputations upon the basis indicated by the tribunal of arbitration atGeneva; and that payment of such losses be authorized to an extent not toexceed the awards of the tribunal at Geneva.By an act approved on the 14th day of February last Congress made provisionfor completing, jointly with an officer or commissioner to be named by HerBritannic Majesty, the determination of so much of the boundary linebetween the territory of the United States and the possessions of GreatBritain as was left uncompleted by the commissioners appointed under theact of Congress of August 11, 1856. Under the provisions of this act thenorthwest water boundary of the United States has been determined andmarked in accordance with the award of the Emperor of Germany. A protocoland a copy of the map upon which the line was thus marked are contained inthe papers submitted herewith.I also transmit a copy of the report of the commissioner for marking thenorthern boundary between the United States and the British possessionswest of the Lake of the Woods, of the operations of the commission duringthe past season. Surveys have been made to a point 497 miles west of theLake of the Woods, leaving about 350 miles to be surveyed, the field workof which can be completed during the next season.The mixed commission organized under the provisions of the treaty ofWashington for settling and determining the claims of citizens of eitherpower against the other arising out of acts committed against their personsor property during the period between April 13, 1861, and April 9, 1865,made its final award on the 25th day of September last. It was awarded thatthe Government of the United States should pay to the Government of HerBritannic Majesty, within twelve months from the date of the award, the sumof $1,929,819 in gold. The commission disallowed or dismissed all otherclaims of British subjects against the United States. The amount of theclaims presented by the British Government, but disallowed or dismissed, isunderstood to be about $93,000,000. It also disallowed all the claims ofcitizens of the United States against Great Britain which were referred toit.I recommend the early passage of an act appropriating the amount necessaryto pay this award against the United States.I have caused to be communicated to the Government of the King of Italy thethanks of this Government for the eminent services rendered by Count Cortias the third commissioner on this commission. With dignity, learning, andimpartiality he discharged duties requiring great labor and constantpatience, to the satisfaction, I believe, of both Governments. I recommendlegislation to create a special court, to consist of three judges, whoshall be empowered to hear and determine all claims of aliens upon theUnited States arising out of acts committed against their persons orproperty during the insurrection. The recent reference under the treaty ofWashington was confined to claims of British subjects arising during theperiod named in the treaty; but it is understood that there are otherBritish claims of a similar nature, arising after the 9th of April, 1865,and it is known that other claims of a like nature are advanced by citizensor subjects of other powers. It is desirable to have these claims alsoexamined and disposed of.Official information being received from the Dutch Government of a state ofwar between the King of the Netherlands and the Sultan of Acheen, theofficers of the United States who were near the seat of the war wereinstructed to observe an impartial neutrality. It is believed that theyhave done so.The joint commission under the convention with Mexico of 1868, having againbeen legally prolonged, has resumed its business, which, it is hoped, maybe brought to an early conclusion. The distinguished representative of HerBritannic Majesty at Washington has kindly consented, with the approval ofhis Government, to assume the arduous and responsible duties of umpire inthis commission, and to lend the weight of his character and name to suchdecisions as may not receive the acquiescence of both the arbitratorsappointed by the respective Governments.The commissioners appointed pursuant to the authority of Congress toexamine into the nature and extent of the forays by trespassers from thatcountry upon the herds of Texas have made a report, which will be submittedfor your consideration.The Venezuelan Government has been apprised of the sense of Congress inregard to the awards of the joint commission under the convention of 25thApril, 1866, as expressed in the act of the 25th of February last.It is apprehended that that Government does not realize the character ofits obligations under that convention. As there is reason to believe,however, that its hesitancy in recognizing them springs, in part at least,from real difficulty in discharging them in connection with its obligationsto other governments, the expediency of further forbearance on our part isbelieved to be worthy of your consideration.The Ottoman Government and that of Egypt have latterly shown a dispositionto relieve foreign consuls of the judicial powers which heretofore theyhave exercised in the Turkish dominions, by organizing other tribunals. AsCongress, however, has by law provided for the discharge of judicialfunctions by consuls of the United States in that quarter under the treatyof 1830, I have not felt at liberty formally to accept the proposed changewithout the assent of Congress, whose decision upon the subject at as earlya period as may be convenient is earnestly requested.I transmit herewith, for the consideration and determination of Congress,an application of the Republic of Santo Domingo to this Government toexercise a protectorate over that Republic.Since the adjournment of Congress the following treaties with foreignpowers have been proclaimed: A naturalization convention with Denmark; aconvention with Mexico for renewing the Claims Commission; a convention offriendship, commerce, and extradition with the Orange Free State, and anaturalization convention with Ecuador.I renew the recommendation made in my message of December, 1870, thatCongress authorize the Postmaster General to issue all commissions toofficials appointed through his Department.I invite the earnest attention of Congress to the existing laws of theUnited States respecting expatriation and the election of nationality byindividuals. Many citizens of the United States reside permanently abroadwith their families. Under the provisions of the act approved February 10,1855, the children of such persons are to be deemed and taken to becitizens of the United States, but the rights of citizenship are not todescend to persons whose fathers never resided in the United States.It thus happens that persons who have never resided within the UnitedStates have been enabled to put forward a pretension to the protection ofthe United States against the claim to military service of the governmentunder whose protection they were born and have been reared. In some caseseven naturalized citizens of the United States have returned to the land oftheir birth, with intent to remain there, and their children, the issue ofa marriage contracted there after their return, and who have never been inthe United States, have laid claim to our protection when the lapse of manyyears had imposed upon them the duty of military service to the onlygovernment which had ever known them personally.Until the year 1868 it was left, embarrassed by conflicting opinions ofcourts and of jurists, to determine how far the doctrine of perpetualallegiance derived from our former colonial relations with Great Britainwas applicable to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept thesedoubts away by enacting that Any declaration, instruction, opinion,order, or decision of any officer of this Government which denies,restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation is inconsistentwith the fundamental principles of this Government. But Congress did notindicate in that statute, nor has it since done so, what acts are to bedeemed to work expatriation. For my own guidance in determining suchquestions I required (under the provisions of the Constitution) the opinionin writing of the principal officer in each of the Executive Departmentsupon certain questions relating to this subject. The result satisfies methat further legislation has become necessary. I therefore commend thesubject to the careful consideration of Congress, and I transmit herewithcopies of the several opinions of the principal officers of the ExecutiveDepartments, together with other correspondence and pertinent informationon the same subject.The United States, who led the way in the overthrow of the feudal doctrineof perpetual allegiance, are among the last to indicate how their owncitizens may elect another nationality. The papers submitted herewithindicate what is necessary to place us on a par with other leading nationsin liberality of legislation on this international question. We havealready in our treaties assented to the principles which would need to beembodied in laws intended to accomplish such results. We have agreed thatcitizens of the United States may cease to be citizens and may voluntarilyrender allegiance to other powers. We have agreed that residence in aforeign land, without intent to return, shall of itself work expatriation.We have agreed in some instances upon the length of time necessary for suchcontinued residence to work a presumption of such intent. I invite Congressnow to mark out and define when and how expatriation can be accomplished;to regulate by law the condition of American women marrying foreigners; tofix the status of children born in a foreign country of American parentsresiding more or less permanently abroad, and to make rules for determiningsuch other kindred points as may seem best to Congress.In compliance with the request of Congress, I transmitted to the Americanminister at Madrid, with instructions to present it to the SpanishGovernment, the joint resolution approved on the 3d of March last,tendering to the people of Spain, in the name and on the behalf of theAmerican people, the congratulations of Congress upon the efforts toconsolidate in Spain the principles of universal liberty in a republicanform of government.The existence of this new Republic was inaugurated by striking the fettersfrom the slaves in Porto Rico. This beneficent measure was followed by therelease of several thousand persons illegally held as slaves in Cuba. Next,the Captain General of that colony was deprived of the power to set asidethe orders of his superiors at Madrid, which had pertained to the officesince 1825. The sequestered estates of American citizens, which had beenthe cause of long and fruitless correspondence, were ordered to be restoredto their owners. All these liberal steps were taken in the face of aviolent opposition directed by the reactionary slave holders of Havana, whoare vainly striving to stay the march of ideas which has terminated slaveryin Christendom, Cuba only excepted. Unhappily, however, this banefulinfluence has thus far succeeded in defeating the efforts of allliberal minded men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, and in preventingthe promised reform in that island. The struggle for political supremacycontinues there.The proslavery and aristocratic party in Cuba is gradually arraigningitself in more and more open hostility and defiance of the home government,while it still maintains a political connection with the Republic in thepeninsula; and although usurping and defying the authority of the homegovernment whenever such usurpation or defiance tends in the direction ofoppression or of the maintenance of abuses, it is still a power in Madrid,and is recognized by the Government. Thus an element more dangerous tocontinued colonial relations between Cuba and Spain than that whichinspired the insurrection at Yara an element opposed to granting anyrelief from misrule and abuse, with no aspirations after freedom,commanding no sympathies in generous breasts, aiming to rivet stillstronger the shackles of slavery and oppression has seized many of theemblems of power in Cuba, and, under professions of loyalty to the mothercountry, is exhausting the resources of the island, and is doing acts whichare at variance with those principles of justice, of liberality, and ofright which give nobility of character to a republic. In the interests ofhumanity, of civilization, and of progress, it is to be hoped that thisevil influence may be soon averted.The steamer Virginius was on the 26th day of September, 1870, dulyregistered at the port of New York as a part of the commercial marine ofthe United States. On the 4th of October, 1870, having received thecertificate of her register in the usual legal form, she sailed from theport of New York and has not since been within the territorial jurisdictionof the United States. On the 31st day of October last, while sailing underthe flag of the United States on the high seas, she was forcibly seized bythe Spanish gunboat Tornado, and was carried into the port of Santiago deCuba, where fifty three of her passengers and crew were inhumanly, and, sofar at least as relates to those who were citizens of the United States,without due process of law, put to death.It is a well established principle, asserted by the United States from thebeginning of their national independence, recognized by Great Britain andother maritime powers, and stated by the Senate in a resolution passedunanimously on the 16th of June, 1858, that American vessels on the highseas in time of peace, bearing the American flag, remain under thejurisdiction of the country to which they belong, and therefore anyvisitation, molestation, or detention of such vessel by force, or by theexhibition of force, on the part of a foreign power is in derogation of thesovereignty of the United States. In accordance with this principle, therestoration of the Virginius and the surrender of the survivors of herpassengers and crew, and a due reparation to the flag, and the punishmentof the authorities who had been guilty of the illegal acts of violence,were demanded. The Spanish Government has recognized the justice of thedemand, and has arranged for the immediate delivery of the vessel, and forthe surrender of the survivors of the passengers and crew, and for a saluteto the flag, and for proceedings looking to the punishment of those who maybe proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of violence toward citizensof the United States, and also toward indemnifying those who may be shownto be entitled to indemnity. A copy of a protocol of a conference betweenthe Secretary of State and the Spanish minister, in which the terms of thisarrangement were agreed to, is transmitted herewith.The correspondence on this subject with the legation of the United Statesin Madrid was conducted in cipher and by cable, and needs the verificationof the actual text of the correspondence. It has seemed to me to be due tothe importance of the case not to submit this correspondence until theaccurate text can be received by mail. It is expected shortly, and will besubmitted when received.In taking leave of this subject for the present I wish to renew theexpression of my conviction that the existence of African slavery in Cubais a principal cause of the lamentable condition of the island. I do notdoubt that Congress shares with me the hope that it will soon be made todisappear, and that peace and prosperity may follow its abolition.The embargoing of American estates in Cuba, cruelty to American citizensdetected in no act of hostility to the Spanish Government, the murdering ofprisoners taken with arms in their hands, and, finally, the capture uponthe high seas of a vessel sailing under the United States flag and bearinga United States registry have culminated in an outburst of indignation thathas seemed for a time to threaten war. Pending negotiations between theUnited States and the Government of Spain on the subject of this capture, Ihave authorized the Secretary of the Navy to put our Navy on a war footing,to the extent, at least, of the entire annual appropriation for that branchof the service, trusting to Congress and the public opinion of the Americanpeople to justify my action.Assuming from the action of the last Congress in appointing a Committee onPrivileges and Elections to prepare and report to this Congress aconstitutional amendment to provide a better method of electing thePresident and Vice President of the United States, and also from thenecessity of such an amendment, that there will be submitted to the Statelegislatures for ratification such an improvement in our Constitution, Isuggest two others for your consideration:First. To authorize the Executive to approve of so much of any measurepassing the two Houses of Congress as his judgment may dictate, withoutapproving the whole, the disapproved portion or portions to be subjected tothe same rules as now, to wit, to be referred back to the House in whichthe measure or measures originated, and, if passed by a two thirds vote ofthe two Houses, then to become a law without the approval of the President.I would add to this a provision that there should be no legislation byCongress during the last twenty four hours of its sitting, except uponvetoes, in order to give the Executive an opportunity to examine andapprove or disapprove bills understandingly.Second. To provide by amendment that when an extra session of Congress isconvened by Executive proclamation legislation during the continuance ofsuch extra session shall be confined to such subjects as the Executive maybring before it from time to time in writing.The advantages to be gained by these two amendments are too obvious for meto comment upon them. One session in each year is provided for by theConstitution, in which there are no restrictions as to the subjects oflegislation by Congress. If more are required, it is always in the power ofCongress, during their term of office, to provide for sessions at any time.The first of these amendments would protect the public against the manyabuses and waste of public moneys which creep into appropriation bills andother important measures passing during the expiring hours of Congress, towhich otherwise due consideration can not be given.TREASURY DEPARTMENT.The receipts of the Government from all sources for the last fiscal yearwere $333,738,204, and expenditures on all accounts $290,345,245, thusshowing an excess of receipts over expenditures of $43,392,959. But it isnot probable that this favorable exhibit will be shown for the presentfiscal year. Indeed, it is very doubtful whether, except with great economyon the part of Congress in making appropriations and the same economy inadministering the various Departments of Government, the revenues will notfall short of meeting actual expenses, including interest on the publicdebt.I commend to Congress such economy, and point out two sources where Itseems to me it might commence, to wit, in the appropriations for publicbuildings in the many cities where work has not yet been commenced; in theappropriations for river and harbor improvement in those localities wherethe improvements are of but little benefit to general commerce, and forfortifications.There is a still more fruitful source of expenditure, which I will pointout later in this message. I refer to the easy method of manufacturingclaims for losses incurred in suppressing the late rebellion.I would not be understood here as opposing the erection of good,substantial, and even ornamental buildings by the Government wherever suchbuildings are needed. In fact, I approve of the Government owning its ownbuildings in all sections of the country, and hope the day is not fardistant when it will not only possess them, but will erect in the capitalsuitable residences for all persons who now receive commutation forquarters or rent at Government expense, and for the Cabinet, thus settingan example to the States which may induce them to erect buildings for theirSenators. But I would have this work conducted at a time when the revenuesof the country would abundantly justify it.The revenues have materially fallen off for the first five months of thepresent fiscal year from what they were expected to produce, owing to thegeneral panic now prevailing, which commenced about the middle of Septemberlast. The full effect of this disaster, if it should not prove a "blessingin disguise," is yet to be demonstrated. In either event it is your duty toheed the lesson and to provide by wise and well considered legislation, asfar as it lies in your power, against its recurrence, and to take advantageof all benefits that may have accrued.My own judgment is that, however much individuals may have suffered, onelong step has been taken toward specie payments; that we can never havepermanent prosperity until a specie basis is reached: and that a speciebasis can not be reached and maintained until our exports, exclusive ofgold, pay for our imports, interest due abroad, and other specieobligations, or so nearly so as to leave an appreciable accumulation of theprecious metals in the country from the products of our mines.The development of the mines of precious metals during the past year andthe prospective development of them for years to come are gratifying intheir results. Could but one half of the gold extracted from the mines beretained at home, our advance toward specie payments would be rapid.To increase our exports sufficient currency is required to keep all theindustries of the country employed. Without this national as well asindividual bankruptcy must ensue. Undue inflation, on the other hand, whileit might give temporary relief, would only lead to inflation of prices, theimpossibility of competing in our own markets for the products of homeskill and labor, and repeated renewals of present experiences. Elasticityto our circulating medium, therefore, and just enough of it to transact thelegitimate business of the country and to keep all industries employed, iswhat is most to be desired. The exact medium is specie, the recognizedmedium of exchange the world over. That obtained, we shall have a currencyof an exact degree of elasticity. If there be too much of it for thelegitimate purposes of trade and commerce, it will flow out of the country.If too little, the reverse will result. To hold what we have and toappreciate our currency to that standard is the problem deserving of themost serious consideration of Congress.The experience of the present panic has proven that the currency of thecountry, based, as it is, upon the credit of the country, is the best thathas ever been devised. Usually in times of such trials currency has becomeworthless, or so much depreciated in value as to inflate the values of allthe necessaries of life as compared with the currency. Everyone holding ithas been anxious to dispose of it on any terms. Now we witness the reverse.Holders of currency hoard it as they did gold in former experiences of alike nature.It is patent to the most casual observer that much more currency, or money,is required to transact the legitimate trade of the country during the falland winter months, when the vast crops are being removed, than during thebalance of the year. With our present system the amount in the countryremains the same throughout the entire year, resulting in an accumulationof all the surplus capital of the country in a few centers when notemployed in the moving of crops, tempted there by the offer of interest oncall loans. Interest being paid, this surplus capital must earn thisinterest paid with a profit. Being subject to "call," it can not be loaned,only in part at best, to the merchant or manufacturer for a fixed term.Hence, no matter how much currency there might be in the country, it wouldbe absorbed, prices keeping pace with the volume, and panics, stringency,and disasters would ever be recurring with the autumn. Elasticity in ourmonetary system, therefore, is the object to be attained first, and next tothat, as far as possible, a prevention of the use of other people\'s moneyin stock and other species of speculation. To prevent the latter it seemsto me that one great step would be taken by prohibiting the national banksfrom paying interest on deposits, by requiring them to hold their reservesin their own vaults, and by forcing them into resumption, though it wouldonly be in legal tender notes. For this purpose I would suggest theestablishment of clearing houses for your consideration.To secure the former many plans have been suggested, most, if not all, ofwhich look to me more like inflation on the one hand, or compelling theGovernment, on the other, to pay interest, without corresponding benefits,upon the surplus funds of the country during the seasons when otherwiseunemployed.I submit for your consideration whether this difficulty might not beovercome by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue at any timeto national banks of issue any amount of their own notes below a fixedpercentage of their issue (say 40 per cent), upon the banks\' depositingwith the Treasurer of the United States an amount of Government bonds equalto the amount of notes demanded, the banks to forfeit to the Government,say, 4 per cent of the interest accruing on the bonds so pledged during thetime they remain with the Treasurer as security for the increasedcirculation, the bonds so pledged to be redeemable by the banks at theirpleasure, either in whole or in part, by returning their own bills forcancellation to an amount equal to the face of the bonds withdrawn. I wouldfurther suggest for your consideration the propriety of authorizingnational banks to diminish their standing issue at pleasure, by returningfor cancellation their own bills and withdrawing so many United Statesbonds as are pledged for the bills returned.In view of the great actual contraction that has taken place in thecurrency and the comparative contraction continuously going on, due to theincrease of population, increase of manufactories and all the industries, Ido not believe there is too much of it now for the dullest period of theyear. Indeed, if clearing houses should be established, thus forcingredemption, it is a question for your consideration whether banking shouldnot be made free, retaining all the safeguards now required to secure billholders. In any modification of the present laws regulating national banks,as a further step toward preparing for resumption of specie payments, Iinvite your attention to a consideration of the propriety of exacting fromthem the retention as a part of their reserve either the whole or a part ofthe gold interest accruing upon the bonds pledged as security for theirissue. I have not reflected enough on the bearing this might have inproducing a scarcity of coin with which to pay duties on imports to give itmy positive recommendation. But your attention is invited to the subject.During the last four years the currency has been contracted, directly, bythe withdrawal of 3 per cent certificates, compound interest notes, and"seven thirty" bonds outstanding on the 4th of March, 1869, all of whichtook the place of legal tenders in the bank reserves to the extent of$63,000,000.During the same period there has been a much larger comparative contractionof the currency. The population of the country has largely increased. Morethan 25,000 miles of railroad have been built, requiring the active use ofcapital to operate them. Millions of acres of land have been opened tocultivation, requiring capital to move the products. Manufactories havemultiplied beyond all precedent in the same period of time, requiringcapital weekly for the payment of wages and for the purchase of material;and probably the largest of all comparative contraction arises from theorganizing of free labor in the South. Now every laborer there receives hiswages, and, for want of savings banks, the greater part of such wages iscarried in the pocket or hoarded until required for use.These suggestions are thrown out for your consideration, without anyrecommendation that they shall be adopted literally, but hoping that thebest method may be arrived at to secure such an elasticity of the currencyas will keep employed all the industries of the country and prevent such aninflation as will put off indefinitely the resumption of specie payments,an object so devoutly to be wished for by all, and by none more earnestlythan the class of people most directly interested those who "earn theirbread by the sweat of their brow." The decisions of Congress on thissubject will have the hearty support of the Executive.In previous messages I have called attention to the decline in Americanshipbuilding and recommended such legislation as would secure to us ourproportion of the carrying trade. Stimulated by high rates and abundance offreight, the progress for the last year in shipbuilding has been verysatisfactory. There has been an increase of about 3 per cent in the amounttransported in American vessels over the amount of last year. With thereduced cost of material which has taken place, it may reasonably be hopedthat this progress will be maintained, and even increased. However, as wepay about $80,000,000 per annum to foreign vessels for the transportationto a market of our surplus products, thus increasing the balance of tradeagainst us to this amount, the subject is one worthy of your seriousconsideration."Cheap transportation" is a subject that has attracted the attention ofboth producers and consumers for the past few years, and has contributedto, if it has not been the direct cause of, the recent panic andstringency.As Congress, at its last session, appointed a special committee toinvestigate this whole subject during the vacation and report at thissession, I have nothing to recommend until their report is read.There is one work, however, of a national character, in which the greaterportion of the East and the West, the North and the South, are equallyinterested, to which I will invite your attention.The State of New York has a canal connecting Lake Erie with tide water onthe Hudson River. The State of Illinois has a similar work connecting LakeMichigan with navigable water on the Illinois River, thus making watercommunication inland between the East and the West and South. These greatartificial water courses are the property of the States through which theypass, and pay toll to those States. Would it not be wise statesmanship topledge these States that if they will open these canals for the passage oflarge vessels the General Government will look after and keep in navigablecondition the great public highways with which they connect, to wit, theOverslaugh on the Hudson, the St. Clair Flats, and the Illinois andMississippi rivers? This would be a national work; one of great value tothe producers of the West and South in giving them cheap transportation fortheir produce to the seaboard and a market, and to the consumers in theEast in giving them cheaper food, particularly of those articles of foodwhich do not find a foreign market, and the prices of which, therefore, arenot regulated by foreign demands. The advantages of such a work are tooobvious for argument. I submit the subject to you, therefore, withoutfurther comment.In attempting to regain our lost commerce and carrying trade I haveheretofore called attention to the States south of us offering a fieldwhere much might be accomplished. To further this object I suggest that asmall appropriation be made, accompanied with authority for the Secretaryof the Navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon River to themouth of the Madeira; thence to explore that river and its tributaries intoBolivia, and to report to Congress at its next session, or as soon aspracticable, the accessibility of the country by water, its resources, andthe population so reached. Such an exploration would cost but little; itcan do no harm, and may result in establishing a trade of value to bothnations.In further connection with the Treasury Department I would recommend arevision and codification of the tariff laws and the opening of more mintsfor coining money, with authority to coin for such nations as may apply.WAR DEPARTMENT.The attention of Congress is invited to the recommendations contained inthe report of the Secretary of War herewith accompanying.The apparent great cost of supporting the Army is fully explained by thisreport, and I hope will receive your attention.While inviting your general attention to all the recommendations made bythe Secretary of War, there are two which I would especially invite you toconsider: First, the importance of preparing for war in time of peace byproviding proper armament for our seacoast defenses. Proper armament is ofvastly more importance than fortifications. The latter can be supplied veryspeedily for temporary purposes when needed; the former can not. The secondis the necessity of reopening promotion in the staff corps of the Army.Particularly is this necessity felt in the Medical, Pay, and Ordnancedepartments.At this time it is necessary to employ "contract surgeons" to supply thenecessary medical attendance required by the Army.With the present force of the Pay Department it is now difficult to makethe payments to troops provided for by law. Long delays in payments areproductive of desertions and other demoralization, and the law prohibitsthe payment of troops by other than regular army paymasters.There are now sixteen vacancies in the Ordnance Department, thus leavingthat branch of the service without sufficient officers to conduct thebusiness of the different arsenals on a large scale if ever required.NAVY DEPARTMENT.During the past year our Navy has been depleted by the sale of some vesselsno longer fit for naval service and by the condemnation of others not yetdisposed of. This, however, has been more than compensated for by therepair of six of the old wooden ships and by the building of eight newsloops of war, authorized by the last Congress. The building of theselatter has occurred at a doubly fortunate time. They are about beingcompleted at a time when they may possibly be much needed, and the workupon them has not only given direct employment to thousands of men, but hasno doubt been the means of keeping open establishments for other work at atime of great financial distress.Since the commencement of the last month, however, the distressingoccurrences which have taken place in the waters of the Caribbean Sea,almost on our very seaboard, while they illustrate most forcibly thenecessity always existing that a nation situated like ours should maintainin a state of possible efficiency a navy adequate to its responsibilities,has at the same time demanded that all the effective force we really haveshall be put in immediate readiness for warlike service. This has been andis being done promptly and effectively, and I am assured that all theavailable ships and every authorized man of the American Navy will be readyfor whatever action is required for the safety of our citizens or themaintenance of our honor. This, of course, will require the expenditure ina short time of some of the appropriations which were calculated to extendthrough the fiscal year, but Congress will, I doubt not, understand andappreciate the emergency, and will provide adequately not only for thepresent preparation, but for the future maintenance of our naval force. TheSecretary of the Navy has during the past year been quietly putting some ofour most effective monitors in condition for service, and thus the exigencyfinds us in a much better condition for work than we could possibly havebeen without his action.POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.A complete exhibit is presented in the accompanying report of thepostmaster General of the operations of the Post Office Department duringthe year. The ordinary postal revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30,1873, amounted to $22,996,741.57, and the expenditures of all kinds to$29,084,945.67. The increase of revenues over 1872 was $1,081,315.20, andthe increase of expenditures $2,426,753.36.Independent of the payments made from special appropriations for mailsteamship lines, the amount drawn from the General Treasury to meetdeficiencies was $5,265,475. The constant and rapid extension of our postalservice, particularly upon railways, and the improved facilities for thecollection, transmission, distribution, and delivery of the mails which areconstantly being provided account for the increased expenditures of thispopular branch of the public service.The total number of post offices in operation on June 30, 1873, was 33,244,a net increase of 1,381 over the number reported the preceding year. Thenumber of Presidential offices was 1,363, an increase of 163 during theyear. The total length of railroad mail routes at the close of the year was63,457 miles, an increase of 5,546 miles over the year 1872. Fifty ninerailway post office lines were in operation June 30, 1873, extending over14,866 miles of railroad routes and performing an aggregate service of34,925 miles daily.The number of letters exchanged with foreign countries was 27,459,185, anincrease of 3,096,685 over the previous year, and the postage thereonamounted to $2,021,310.86. The total weight of correspondence exchanged inthe mails with European countries exceeded 912 tons, an increase of 92 tonsover the previous year. The total cost of the United States ocean steamshipservice, including $725,000 paid from special appropriations to subsidizedlines of mail steamers, was $1,047,271.35.New or additional postal conventions have been concluded with Sweden,Norway, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Newfoundland, and Japan, reducing postagerates on correspondence exchanged with those countries; and further effortshave been made to conclude a satisfactory postal convention with France,but without success.I invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the suggestions andrecommendations of the Postmaster General for an extension of thefree delivery system in all cities having a population of not less than10,000; for the prepayment of postage on newspapers and other printedmatter of the second class; for a uniform postage and limit of weight onmiscellaneous matter; for adjusting the compensation of all postmasters notappointed by the President, by the old method of commissions on the actualreceipts of the office, instead of the present mode of fixing the salary inadvance upon special returns; and especially do I urge favorable action byCongress on the important recommendations of the Postmaster General for theestablishment of United States postal savings depositories.Your attention is also again called to a consideration of the question ofpostal telegraphs and the arguments adduced in support thereof, in the hopethat you may take such action in connection therewith as in your judgmentwill most contribute to the best interests of the country.DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.Affairs in Utah require your early and special attention. The Supreme Courtof the United States, in the case of Clinton vs. Englebrecht, decided thatthe United States marshal of that Territory could not lawfully summonjurors for the district courts; and those courts hold that the Territorialmarshal can not lawfully perform that duty, because he is elected by thelegislative assembly, and not appointed as provided for in the actorganizing the Territory. All proceedings at law are practically abolishedby these decisions, and there have been but few or no jury trials in thedistrict courts of that Territory since the last session of Congress.Property is left without protection by the courts, and crimes gounpunished. To prevent anarchy there it is absolutely necessary thatCongress provide the courts with some mode of obtaining jurors, and Irecommend legislation to that end, and also that the probate courts of theTerritory, now assuming to issue writs of injunction and habeas corpus andto try criminal cases and questions as to land titles, be denied alljurisdiction not possessed ordinarily by courts of that description.I have become impressed with the belief that the act approved March 2,1867, entitled "An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcythroughout the United States," is productive of more evil than good at thistime. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but, if thisis not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously questionedthat those portions of said act providing for what is called involuntarybankruptcy operate to increase the financial embarrassments of the country.Careful and prudent men very often become involved in debt in thetransaction of their business, and though they may possess ample property,if it could be made available for that purpose, to meet all theirliabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money, theymay be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations as they become due,in consequence of which they are liable to be prostrated in their businessby proceedings in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditors.People are now so easily alarmed as to monetary matters that the merefiling of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor willnecessarily embarrass, and oftentimes accomplish the financial ruin, of aresponsible business man. Those who otherwise might make lawful and justarrangements to relieve themselves from difficulties produced by thepresent stringency in money are prevented by their constant exposure toattack and disappointment by proceedings against them in bankruptcy, and,besides, the law is made use of in many cases by obdurate creditors tofrighten or force debtors into a compliance with their wishes and into actsof injustice to other creditors and to themselves. I recommend that so muchof said act as provides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of thesuspension of payment be repealed.Your careful attention is invited to the subject of claims against theGovernment and to the facilities afforded by existing laws for theirprosecution. Each of the Departments of State, Treasury, and War hasdemands for many millions of dollars upon its files, and they are rapidlyaccumulating. To these may be added those now pending before Congress, theCourt of Claims, and the Southern Claims Commission, making in theaggregate an immense sum. Most of these grow out of the rebellion, and areintended to indemnify persons on both sides for their losses during thewar; and not a few of them are fabricated and supported by false testimony.Projects are on foot, it is believed, to induce Congress to provide for newclasses of claims, and to revive old ones through the repeal ormodification of the statute of limitations, by which they are now barred. Ipresume these schemes, if proposed, will be received with little favor byCongress, and I recommend that persons having claims against the UnitedStates cognizable by any tribunal or Department thereof be required topresent them at an early day, and that legislation be directed as far aspracticable to the defeat of unfounded and unjust demands upon theGovernment; and I would suggest, as a means of preventing fraud, thatwitnesses be called upon to appear in person to testify before thosetribunals having said claims before them for adjudication. Probably thelargest saving to the National Treasury can be secured by timelylegislation on these subjects of any of the economic measures that will beproposed.You will be advised of the operations of the Department of Justice by thereport of the Attorney General, and I invite your attention to theamendments of existing laws suggested by him, with the view of reducing theexpenses of that Department.DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.The policy inaugurated toward the Indians at the beginning of the lastAdministration has been steadily pursued, and, I believe, with beneficialresults. It will be continued with only such modifications as time andexperience may demonstrate as necessary.With the encroachment of civilization upon the Indian reservations andhunting grounds, disturbances have taken place between the Indians andwhites during the past year, and probably will continue to do so until eachrace appreciates that the other has rights which must be respected.The policy has been to collect the Indians as rapidly as possible onreservations, and as far as practicable within what is known as the IndianTerritory, and to teach them the arts of civilization and self support.Where found off their reservations, and endangering the peace and safety ofthe whites, they have been punished, and will continue to be for likeoffenses.The Indian Territory south of Kansas and west of Arkansas is sufficient inarea and agricultural resources to support all the Indians east of theRocky Mountains. In time, no doubt, all of them, except a few who may electto make their homes among white people, will be collected there. As apreparatory step for this consummation, I am now satisfied that aTerritorial form of government should be given them, which will secure thetreaty rights of the original settlers and protect their homesteads fromalienation for a period of twenty years.The operations of the Patent Office are growing to such a magnitude and theaccumulation of material is becoming so great that the necessity of moreroom is becoming more obvious day by day. I respectfully invite yourattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and Commissionerof Patents on this subject.The business of the General Land Office exhibits a material increase in allits branches during the last fiscal year. During that time there weredisposed of out of the public lands 13,030,606 acres, being an amountgreater by 1,165,631 acres than was disposed of during the preceding year.Of the amount disposed of, 1,626,266 acres were sold for cash, 214,940acres were located with military land warrants, 3,793,612 acres were takenfor homesteads, 653,446 acres were located with agricultural college scrip,6,083,536 acres were certified by railroads, 76,576 acres were granted towagon roads, 238,548 acres were approved to States as swamp lands, 138,681acres were certified for agricultural colleges, common schools,universities, and seminaries, 190,775 acres were approved to States forinternal improvements, and 14,222 acres were located with Indian scrip. Thecash receipts during the same time were $3,408,515.50, being $190,415.50 inexcess of the receipts of the previous year. During the year 30,488,132acres of public land were surveyed, an increase over the amount surveyedthe previous year of 1,037,193 acres, and, added to the area previouslysurveyed, aggregates 616,554,895 acres which have been surveyed, leaving1,218,443,505 acres of the public land still unsurveyed.The increased and steadily increasing facilities for reaching ourunoccupied public domain and for the transportation of surplus productsenlarge the available field for desirable homestead locations, thusstimulating settlement and extending year by year in a gradually increasingratio the area of occupation and cultivation.The expressed desire of the representatives of a large colony of citizensof Russia to emigrate to this country, as is understood, with the consentof their Government, if certain concessions can be made to enable them tosettle in a compact colony, is of great interest, as going to show thelight in which our institutions are regarded by an industrious,intelligent, and wealthy people, desirous of enjoying civil and religiousliberty; and the acquisition of so large an immigration of citizens of asuperior class would without doubt be of substantial benefit to thecountry. I invite attention to the suggestion of the Secretary of theInterior in this behalf.There was paid during the last fiscal year for pensions, including theexpense of disbursement, $29,185,289.62, being an amount less by$984,050.98 than was expended for the same purpose the preceding year.Although this statement of expenditures would indicate a material reductionin amount compared with the preceding year, it is believed that the changesin the pension laws at the last session of Congress will absorb that amountthe current year. At the close of the last fiscal year there were on thepension rolls 99,804 invalid military pensioners and 112,088 widows,orphans, and dependent relatives of deceased soldiers, making a total ofthat class of 211,892; 18,266 survivors of the War of 1812 and 5,058 widowsof soldiers of that war pensioned under the act of Congress of February 14,1871, making a total of that class of 23,319; 1,480 invalid navy pensionersand 1,770 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of deceased officers,sailors, and marines of the Navy, making a total of navy pensioners of3,200, and a grand total of pensioners of 311 classes of 238,411, showing anet increase during the last fiscal year of 6,182. During the last year thenames of 16,405 pensioners were added to the rolls, and 10,223 names weredropped therefrom for various causes.The system adopted for the detection of frauds against the Government inthe matter of pensions has been productive of satisfactory results, butlegislation is needed to provide, if possible, against the perpetration ofsuch frauds in future.The evidently increasing interest in the cause of education is a mostencouraging feature in the general progress and prosperity of the country,and the Bureau of Education is earnest in its efforts to give properdirection to the new appliances and increased facilities which are beingoffered to aid the educators of the country in their great work.The Ninth Census has been completed, the report thereof published anddistributed, and the working force of the Bureau disbanded. The Secretaryof the Interior renews his recommendation for a census to be taken in 1875,to which subject the attention of Congress is invited. The originalsuggestion in that behalf has met with the general approval of the country;and even if it be not deemed advisable at present to provide for a regularquinquennial census, a census taken in 1875, the report of which could becompleted and published before the one hundredth anniversary of ournational independence, would be especially interesting and valuable, asshowing the progress of the country during the first century of ournational existence. It is believed, however, that a regular census everyfive years would be of substantial benefit to the country, inasmuch as ourgrowth hitherto has been so rapid that the results of the decennial censusare necessarily unreliable as a basis of estimates for the latter years ofa decennial period.DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.Under the very efficient management of the governor and the board of publicworks of this District the city of Washington is rapidly assuming theappearance of a capital of which the nation may well be proud. From being amost unsightly place three years ago, disagreeable to pass through insummer in consequence of the dust arising from unpaved streets, and almostimpassable in the winter from the mud, it is now one of the most sightlycities in the country, and can boast of being the best paved.The work has been done systematically, the plans, grades, location ofsewers, water and gas mains being determined upon before the work wascommenced, thus securing permanency when completed. I question whether somuch has ever been accomplished before in any American city for the sameexpenditures. The Government having large reservations in the city, and thenation at large having an interest in their capital, I recommend a liberalpolicy toward the District of Columbia, and that the Government should bearits just share of the expense of these improvements. Every citizen visitingthe capital feels a pride in its growing beauty, and that he too is partowner in the investments made here.I would suggest to Congress the propriety of promoting the establishment inthis District of an institution of learning, or university of the highestclass, by the donation of lands. There is no place better suited for suchan institution than the national capital. There is no other place in whichevery citizen is so directly interested.CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.In three successive messages to Congress I have called attention to thesubject of "civil service reform."Action has been taken so far as to authorize the appointment of a board todevise rules governing methods of making appointments and promotions, butthere never has been any action making these rules, or any rules, binding,or even entitled to observance, where persons desire the appointment of afriend or the removal of an official who may be disagreeable to them.To have any rules effective they must have the acquiescence of Congress aswell as of the Executive. I commend, therefore, the subject to yourattention, and suggest that a special committee of Congress might conferwith the Civil Service Board during the present session for the purpose ofdevising such rules as can be maintained, and which will secure theservices of honest and capable officials, and which will also protect themin a degree of independence while in office.Proper rules will protect Congress, as well as the Executive, from muchneedless persecution, and will prove of great value to the public atlarge.I would recommend for your favorable consideration the passage of anenabling act for the admission of Colorado as a State in the Union. Itpossesses all the elements of a prosperous State, agricultural and mineral,and, I believe, has a population now to justify such admission. Inconnection with this I would also recommend the encouragement of a canalfor purposes of irrigation from the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains tothe Missouri River. As a rule I am opposed to further donations of publiclands for internal improvements owned and controlled by privatecorporations, but in this instance I would make an exception. Between theMissouri River and the Rocky Mountains there is an arid belt of public landfrom 300 to 500 miles in width, perfectly valueless for the occupation ofman, for the want of sufficient rain to secure the growth of any product.An irrigating canal would make productive a belt as wide as the supply ofwater could be made to spread over across this entire country, and wouldsecure a cordon of settlements connecting the present population of themountain and mining regions with that of the older States. All the landreclaimed would be clear gain. If alternate sections are retained by theGovernment, I would suggest that the retained sections be thrown open toentry under the homestead laws, or sold to actual settlers for a very lowprice.I renew my previous recommendation to Congress for general amnesty. Thenumber engaged in the late rebellion yet laboring under disabilities isvery small, but enough to keep up a constant irritation. No possible dangercan accrue to the Government by restoring them to eligibility to holdoffice.I suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law to better securethe civil rights which freedom should secure, but has not effectuallysecured, to the enfranchised slave.
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:Since the convening of Congress one year ago the nation has undergone aprostration in business and industries such as has not been witnessed withus for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this prostration mightbe indulged in without profit, because as many theories would be advancedas there would be independent writers those who expressed their own viewswithout borrowing upon the subject. Without indulging in theories as tothe cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call your attention onlyto the fact, and to some plain questions as to which it would seem thereshould be no disagreement.During this prostration two essential elements of prosperity have been mostabundant labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed. Wheresecurity has been undoubted, capital has been attainable at very moderaterates. Where labor has been wanted, it has been found in abundance, atcheap rates compared with what of necessaries and comforts of life couldbe purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity,therefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added: Our soil andclimate are unequaled, within the limits of any contiguous territory underone nationality, for its variety of products to feed and clothe a peopleand in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored peoples.Therefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wisestatesmanship, at this session of Congress, would dictate legislationignoring the past; directing in proper channels these great elements ofprosperity to any people. Debt, debt abroad, is the only element that can,with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continueddepression in the industries and prosperity of our people.A great conflict for national existence made necessary, for temporarypurposes, the raising of large sums of money from whatever sourceattainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress and I do notdoubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of thetimes to devise a system of national currency which it proved to beimpossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of the civilizedworld. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extravagance andluxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, andinvolving, both directly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness. Thecurrency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold forlegitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculationwithin itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreignindebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which shouldbe paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt wascontracted gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government cannot be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. But ourcommerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding and carrying capacityincreased; foreign markets sought for products of the soil andmanufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where anew market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil,the mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing ouridle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in myjudgment, the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure acurrency of fixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilizationreigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find amarket with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labornecessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silverare now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and tothis we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of thepledges of the American Congress when our present legal tender system wasadopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay certainly nounnecessary delay in fixing by legislation a method by which we willreturn to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your specialattention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanentrevival of business and industries until a policy is adopted withlegislation to carry it out looking to a return to a specie basis. It iseasy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it ofvalue to them to make so called money abundant until they can throw aportion of their burdens upon others. But even these, I believe, would bedisappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep indoubt the value of the legal tender medium of exchange. A revival ofproductive industry is needed by all classes; by none more than the holdersof property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realizationupon its sale. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to bebenefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not thegeneral loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just ashonest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal tendersto the extent of his liabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer,for fear of overissues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debtobligations are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew,each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? Thesepropositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking orhonest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakesof this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out thata convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming ourpledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positiveaction by Congress, or by national disasters which will destroy, for a timeat least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. A soundcurrency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of theintegrity of the nation and of individuals. I believe it is in the power ofCongress at this session to devise such legislation as will renewconfidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperityto last for many years and to save the credit of the nation and of thepeople. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisitesto this devoutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touchupon hereafter.A nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in value labors undertwo great disadvantages: First, having no use for the world\'s acknowledgedmedium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out of the countrybecause there is no need for their use; second, the medium of exchange inuse being of a fluctuating value for, after all, it is only worth justwhat it will purchase of gold and silver, metals having an intrinsic valuejust in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them a largermargin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It ismonths from the date of production to the date of realization. Interestupon capital must be charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of thatwhich is to be received in payment added. Hence high prices, acting as aprotection to the foreign producer, who receives nothing in exchange forthe products of his skill and labor except a currency good, at a stablevalue, the world over It seems to me that nothing is clearer than that thegreater part of the burden of existing prostration, for the want of a soundfinancial system, falls upon the working man, who must after all producethe wealth, and the salaried man, who superintends and conducts business.The burden falls upon them in two ways by the deprivation of employmentand by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty ofCongress to devise the method of correcting the evils which areacknowledged to exist, and not mine. But I will venture to suggest two orthree things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to a return to speciepayments, the first great requisite in a return to prosperity. Thelegal tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency by theNational Government should be repealed, to take effect as to all contractsentered into after a day fixed in the repealing act not to apply, however,to payments of salaries by Government, or for other expenditures nowprovided by law to be paid in currency, in the interval pending betweenrepeal and final resumption. Provision should be made by which theSecretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary fromtime to time from the date when specie redemption commences. To this mightand should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insurean accumulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain permanent redemption.I commend this subject to your careful consideration, believing that afavorable solution is attainable, and if reached by this Congress that thepresent and future generations will ever gratefully remember it as theirdeliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace.With resumption, free banking may be authorized with safety, giving thesame full protection to bill holders which they have under existing laws.Indeed, I would regard free banking as essential. It would give properelasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for thetransaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started, and in turnbanks would wind up their business when it was found that there was asuperabundance of currency. The experience and judgment of the people canbest decide just how much currency is required for the transaction of thebusiness of the country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of thisquestion to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Executive.Congress should make the regulation under which banks may exist, but shouldnot make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable papercurrency that shall be authorized. Such importance do I attach to thissubject, and so earnestly do I commend it to your attention, that I give itprominence by introducing it at the beginning of this message.During the past year nothing has occurred to disturb the general friendlyand cordial relations of the United States with other powers.The correspondence submitted herewith between this Government and itsdiplomatic representatives, as also with the representatives of othercountries, shows a satisfactory condition of all questions between theUnited States and the most of those countries, and with few exceptions, towhich reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of differenceto be adjusted.The notice directed by the resolution of Congress of June 17, 1874, to begiven to terminate the convention of July 17, 1858, between the UnitedStates and Belgium has been given, and the treaty will accordinglyterminate on the 1st day of July, 1875. This convention secured to certainBelgian vessels entering the ports of the United States exceptionalprivileges which are not accorded to our own vessels. Other features of theconvention have proved satisfactory, and have tended to the cultivation ofmutually beneficial commercial intercourse and friendly relations betweenthe two countries. I hope that negotiations which have been invited willresult in the celebration of another treaty which may tend to the interestsof both countries.Our relations with China continue to be friendly. During the past year thefear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the landing ofan armed force upon the island of Formosa by the latter, has occasioneduneasiness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the difficulties arisingfrom this cause will be adjusted, and that the advance of civilization inthese Empires may not be retarded by a state of war. In consequence of thepart taken by certain citizens of the United States in this expedition, ourrepresentatives in those countries have been instructed to impress upon theGovernments of China and Japan the firm intention of this country tomaintain strict neutrality in the event of hostilities, and to carefullyprevent any infraction of law on the part of our citizens.In connection with this subject I call the attention of Congress to agenerally conceded fact that the great proportion of the Chineseimmigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily, to make theirhomes with us and their labor productive of general prosperity, but comeunder contracts with headmen, who own them almost absolutely. In a worseform does this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perceptible percentage ofthem perform any honorable labor, but they are brought for shamefulpurposes, to the disgrace of the communities where settled and to the greatdemoralization of the youth of those localities. If this evil practice canbe legislated against, it will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforceany regulation to secure so desirable an end.It is hoped that negotiations between the Government of Japan and thetreaty powers, looking to the further opening of the Empire and to theremoval of various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce theresults desired, which can not fail to inure to the benefit of all theparties. Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration ofCongress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from thefurther payment of the indemnity under the convention of October 22, 1864,and as no action had been taken thereon, it became my duty to regard theobligations of the convention as in force; and as the other powersinterested had received their portion of the indemnity in full, theminister of the United States in Japan has, in behalf of this Government,received the remainder of the amount due to the United States under theconvention of Simonosaki. I submit the propriety of applying the income ofa part, if not of the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japaneselanguage of a number of young men to be under obligations to serve theGovernment for a specified time as interpreters at the legation and theconsulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the sametime be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result toboth Governments. The importance of having our own citizens, competent andfamiliar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in othercapacities connected with the legation and the consulates in that countrycan not readily be overestimated.The amount awarded to the Government of Great Britain by the mixedcommission organized under the provisions of the treaty of Washington insettlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committedbetween April 13, 1861, and April 9, 1865, became payable, under the termsof the treaty, within the past year, and was paid upon the 21st day ofSeptember, 1874. In this connection I renew my recommendation, made at theopening of the last session of Congress, that a special court be created tohear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States arisingfrom acts committed against their persons or property during theinsurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity should be offered tocitizens of other states to present their claims, as well as to thoseBritish subjects whose claims were not admissible under the latecommission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end Irecommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of allclaims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equitable and satisfactorymanner, and to relieve Congress and the Departments from the considerationof these questions.The legislation necessary to extend to the colony of Newfoundland certainarticles of the treaty of Washington of the 8th day of May, 1871, havingbeen had, a protocol to that effect was signed in behalf of the UnitedStates and of Great Britain on the 28th day of May last, and was dulyproclaimed on the following day. A copy of the proclamation is submittedherewith.A copy of the report of the commissioner appointed under the act of March19, 1872, for surveying and marking the boundary between the United Statesand the British possessions from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of theRocky Mountains is herewith transmitted. I am happy to announce that thefield work of the commission has been completed, and the entire line fromthe northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the RockyMountains has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It isbelieved that the amount remaining unexpended of the appropriation made atthe last session of Congress will be sufficient to complete the officework. I recommend that the authority of Congress be given to the use of theunexpended balance of the appropriation in the completion of the work ofthe commission in making its report and preparing the necessary maps.The court known as the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, created byan act of Congress of the last session, has organized and commenced itswork, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissible under the provisionsof the act may be speedily ascertained and paid.It has been deemed advisable to exercise the discretion conferred upon theExecutive at the last session by accepting the conditions required by theGovernment of Turkey for the privilege of allowing citizens of the UnitedStates to hold real estate in the former country, and by assenting to acertain change in the jurisdiction of courts in the latter. A copy of theproclamation upon these subjects is herewith communicated.There has been no material change in our relations with the independentStates of this hemisphere which were formerly under the dominion of Spain.Marauding on the frontiers between Mexico and Texas still frequently takesplace, despite the vigilance of the civil and military authorities in thatquarter. The difficulty of checking such trespasses along the course of ariver of such length as the Rio Grande, and so often fordable, is obvious.It is hoped that the efforts of this Government will be seconded by thoseof Mexico to the effectual suppression of these acts of wrong.From a report upon the condition of the business before the American andMexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on the part of theUnited States, and dated October 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017claims filed on the part of citizens of the United States, 483 had beenfinally decided and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to bedisposed of; and of the 998 claims filed against the United States, 726 hadbeen finally decided, I was before the umpire, and 271 remained to bedisposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been disposedof, reducing somewhat the number still pending; and others have been passedupon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, in view of these figuresand of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire is particularlylaborious, that the commission will be unable to dispose of the entirenumber of claims pending prior to the 1st day of February, 1875 the datefixed for its expiration. Negotiations are pending looking to the securingof the results of the decisions which have been reached and to a furtherextension of the commission for a limited time, which it is confidentlyhoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a finalclose.The strife in the Argentine Republic is to be deplored, both on account ofthe parties thereto and from the probable effects on the interests of thoseengaged in the trade to that quarter, of whom the United States are amongthe principal. As yet, so far as I am aware, there has been no violation ofour neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that respect, itshall be my endeavor to maintain and observe.It is with regret I announce that no further payment has been received fromthe Government of Venezuela on account of awards in favor of citizens ofthe United States. Hopes have been entertained that if that Republic couldescape both foreign and civil war for a few years its great naturalresources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though it is nowunderstood to be at peace with other countries, a serious insurrection isreported to be in progress in an important region of that Republic. Thismay be taken advantage of as another reason to delay the payment of thedues of our citizens.The deplorable strife in Cuba continues without any marked change in therelative advantages of the contending forces. The insurrection continues,but Spain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife give to theinsurrection a significance which can not be denied. Its duration and thetenacity of its adherence, together with the absence of manifested power ofsuppression on the part of Spain, can not be controverted, and may makesome positive steps on the part of other powers a matter of self necessity.I had confidently hoped at this time to be able to announce the arrangementof some of the important questions between this Government and that ofSpain, but the negotiations have been protracted. The unhappy intestinedissensions of Spain command our profound sympathy, and must be accepted asperhaps a cause of some delay. An early settlement, in part at least, ofthe questions between the Governments is hoped. In the meantime, awaitingthe results of immediately pending negotiations, I defer a further andfuller communication on the subject of the relations of this country andSpain.I have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactorycondition of the existing laws with reference to expatriation and theelection of nationality. Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and decisions,it was difficult to exactly determine how far the doctrine of perpetualallegiance was applicable to citizens of the United States. Congress by theact of the 27th of July, 1868, asserted the abstract right of expatriationas a fundamental principle of this Government. Notwithstanding suchassertion and the necessity of frequent application of the principle, nolegislation has been had defining what acts or formalities shall workexpatriation or when a citizen shall be deemed to have renounced or to havelost his citizenship. The importance of such definition is obvious. Therepresentatives of the United States in foreign countries are continuallycalled upon to lend their aid and the protection of the United States topersons concerning the good faith or the reality of whose citizenship thereis at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treatiesfurnish some guide; in others it seems left to the person claiming thebenefits of citizenship, while living in a foreign country, contributing inno manner to the performance of the duties of a citizen of the UnitedStates, and without intention at any time to return and undertake thoseduties, to use the claims to citizenship of the United States simply as ashield from the performance of the obligations of a citizen elsewhere.The status of children born of American parents residing in a foreigncountry, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizensresiding abroad where such question is not regulated by treaty, are allsources of frequent difficulty and discussion. Legislation on these andsimilar questions, and particularly defining when and under whatcircumstances expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, isespecially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention ofCongress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization. TheUnited States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship to allwho may come in good faith to reside within its limits on their complyingwith certain prescribed reasonable and simple formalities and conditions.Among the highest duties of the Government is that to afford firm,sufficient, and equal protection to all its citizens, whether native bornor naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying with it suchsupport from the Government should not be fraudulently obtained, and shouldbe bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance with the law; and yetfrequent instances are brought to the attention of the Government ofillegal and fraudulent naturalization and of the unauthorized use ofcertificates thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulentcharacter of the naturalization has appeared upon the face of thecertificate itself; in others examination discloses that the holder had notcomplied with the law, and in others certificates have been obtained wherethe persons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, buthad not even been within the United States at the time of the pretendednaturalization. Instances of each of these classes of fraud are discoveredat our legations, where the certificates of naturalization are presentedeither for the purpose of obtaining passports or in demanding theprotection of the legation. When the fraud is apparent on the face of suchcertificates, they are taken up by the representatives of the Governmentand forwarded to the Department of State. But even then the record of thecourt in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, andduplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Upon the presentation ofthese for the issue of passports or in demanding protection of theGovernment, the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates arenot infrequently used in transactions of business to the deception andinjury of innocent parties. Without placing any additional obstacles in theway of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well intentionedforeigner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestlyrecommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and tosecure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization made infraud.Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratificationof treaties of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru, and Salvador; alsoof a treaty of commerce and navigation with Peru, and one of commerce andconsular privileges with Salvador; all of which have been duly proclaimed,as has also a declaration with Russia with reference to trade marks.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made directlyto Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts andexpenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amountreceived from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each ofthe Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report thatthe amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for thefiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year theestimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. Inview of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 percent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased orexpenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide forthe sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts andobligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a veryconsiderable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number ofarticles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether ornot, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, Iventure the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especiallyfrom imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make itquestionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure tocollect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of theinterests of honest importers and taxpayers.The Secretary of the Treasury in his report favors legislation looking toan early return to specie payments, thus supporting views previouslyexpressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appropriations;calls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea andcoffee, without benefit to the consumer; recommends an increase of 10 centsa gallon on whisky, and, further, that no modification be made in thebanking and currency bill passed at the last session of Congress, unlessmodification should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measuresfor returning to specie payments. In these recommendations I cordiallyjoin.I would suggest to Congress the propriety of readjusting the tariff so asto increase the revenue, and at the same time decrease the number ofarticles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into ourmanufactures and are not produced at home, it seems to me, should beentered free. Those articles of manufacture which we produce a constituentpart of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produceshould enter free also. I will instance fine wool, dyes, etc. Thesearticles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture of the highergrades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medicines,and used in various ways in manufactures come under this class. Theintroduction free of duty of such wools as we do not produce wouldstimulate the manufacture of goods requiring the use of those we doproduce, and therefore would be a benefit to home production. There aremany articles entering into "home manufactures" which we do not produceourselves the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing themanufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the directionof bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other and of supplyingone of the elements of prosperity so much needed.The report of the Secretary of War herewith attached, and forming a part ofthis message, gives all the information concerning the operations, wants,and necessities of the Army, and contains many suggestions andrecommendations which I commend to your special attention.There is no class of Government employees who are harder worked than theArmy officers and men; none who perform their tasks more cheerfully andefficiently and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships.Legislation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the publicservice. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War I regard asjudicious, and I especially commend to your attention the following: Theconsolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage toofficers traveling under orders; the exemption of money received from thesale of subsistence stores from being covered into the Treasury; the use ofappropriations for the purchase of subsistence stores without waiting forthe beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; foradditional appropriations for the collection of torpedo material; forincreased appropriations for the manufacture of arms; for relieving thevarious States from indebtedness for arms charged to them during therebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the Army without trialfor the offense of drawing pay more than once for the same period; for thediscouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by cheek, and for theestablishment of a professorship of rhetoric and English literature at WestPoint. The reasons for these recommendations are obvious, and are set forthsufficiently in the reports attached. I also recommend that the status ofthe staff corps of the Army be fixed, where this has not already been done,so that promotions may be made and vacancies filled as they occur in eachgrade when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. The necessity forsuch legislation is specially felt now in the Pay Department. The number ofofficers in that department is below the number adequate to the performanceof the duties required of them by law.The efficiency of the Navy has been largely increased during the last year.Under the impulse of the foreign complications which threatened us at thecommencement of the last session of Congress, most of our efficient woodenships were put in condition for immediate service, and the repairs of ourironclad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. The result is that mostof these are now in an effective state and need only to be manned and putin commission to go at once into service.Some of the new sloops authorized by Congress are already in commission,and most of the remainder are launched and wait only the completion oftheir machinery to enable them to take their places as part of oureffective force.Two iron torpedo ships have been completed during the last year, and fourof our large double turreted ironclads are now undergoing repairs. Whenthese are finished, everything that is useful of our Navy, as nowauthorized, will be in condition for service, and with the advance in thescience of torpedo warfare the American Navy, comparatively small as it is,will be found at any time powerful for the purposes of a peaceful nation.Much has been accomplished during the year in aid of science and toincrease the sum of general knowledge and further the interests of commerceand civilization. Extensive and much needed soundings have been made forhydrographic purposes and to fix the proper routes of ocean telegraphs.Further surveys of the great Isthmus have been undertaken and completed,and two vessels of the Navy are now employed, in conjunction with those ofEngland, France, Germany, and Russia, in observations connected with thetransit of Venus, so useful and interesting to the scientific world.The estimates for this branch of the public service do not differmaterially from those of last year, those for the general support of theservice being somewhat less and those for permanent improvements at thevarious stations rather larger than the corresponding estimate made a yearago. The regular maintenance and a steady increase in the efficiency ofthis most important arm in proportion to the growth of our maritimeintercourse and interests is recommended to the attention of Congress.The use of the Navy in time of peace might be further utilized by a directauthorization of the employment of naval vessels in explorations andsurveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities on thiscontinent, especially the tributaries of the two great rivers of SouthAmerica, the Orinoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevents, under existing laws,such exploration, except that expenditures must be made in such expeditionsbeyond those usually provided for in the appropriations. The fielddesignated is unquestionably one of interest and one capable of largedevelopment of commercial interests advantageous to the peoples reachedand to those who may establish relations with them.Education of the people entitled to exercise the right of franchise Iregard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so inrepublics, where birth, education, or previous condition does not enterinto account in giving suffrage. Next to the public school, the post officeis the great agent of education over our vast territory. The rapidity withwhich new sections are being settled, thus increasing the carrying of mailsin a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not alarming. Thereport of the Postmaster General herewith attached shows that there was anincrease of revenue in his Department in 1873 over the previous year of$1,674,411, and an increase of cost of carrying the mails and payingemployees of $3,041,468.91. The report of the Postmaster General givesinteresting statistics of his Department, and compares them with thecorresponding statistics of a year ago, showing a growth in every branch ofthe Department.A postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange ofpostal cards established with Switzerland, and the negotiations pending forseveral years past with France have been terminated in a convention withthat country, which went into effect last August.An international postal congress was convened in Berne, Switzerland, inSeptember last, at which the United States was represented by an officer ofthe Post Office Department of much experience and of qualification for theposition. A convention for the establishment of an international postalunion was agreed upon and signed by the delegates of the countriesrepresented, subject to the approval of the proper authorities of thosecountries.I respectfully direct your attention to the report of thePostmaster General and to his suggestions in regard to an equitableadjustment of the question of compensation to railroads for carrying themails.Your attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs in someof the Southern States.On the 14th of September last the governor of Louisiana called upon me, asprovided by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid insuppressing domestic violence in that State. This call was made in view ofa proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Penn, claiming that he waselected lieutenant governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia of theState to arm, assemble, and drive from power the usurpers, as he designatedthe officers of the State government. On the next day I issued myproclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days fromthe date thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had takenforcible possession of the statehouse. Steps were taken by me to supportthe existing and recognized State government, but before the expiration ofthe five days the insurrectionary movement was practically abandoned, andthe officers of the State government, with some minor exceptions, resumedtheir powers and duties. Considering that the present State administrationof Louisiana has been the only government in that State for nearly twoyears; that it has been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in as such byCongress, and more than once expressly recognized by me, I regarded it asmy clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent itsoverthrow by an armed mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity in theelection of 1872. I have heretofore called the attention of Congress tothis subject, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committedat said election, and because it appears that the returns thereof werenever legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen;but from the best sources of information at my command I have alwaysbelieved that the present State officers received a majority of the legalvotes actually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my specialmessage of February 23, 1873, that in the event of no action by Congress Imust continue to recognize the government heretofore recognized by me.I regret to say that with preparations for the late election decidedindications appeared in some localities in the Southern States of adetermination, by acts of violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens ofthe freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions. Bands ofmen, masked and armed, made their appearance; White Leagues and othersocieties were formed; large quantities of arms and ammunition wereimported and distributed to these organizations; military drills, withmenacing demonstrations, were held, and with all these murders enough werecommitted to spread terror among those whose political action was to besuppressed, if possible, by these intolerant and criminal proceedings. Insome places colored laborers were compelled to vote according to the wishesof their employers, under threats of discharge if they acted otherwise; andthere are too many instances in which, when these threats were disregarded,they were remorselessly executed by those who made them. I understand thatthe fifteenth amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent this and alike state of things, and the act of May 31, 1870, with amendments, waspassed to enforce its provisions, the object of both being to guarantee toall citizens the right to vote and to protect them in the free enjoyment ofthat right. Enjoined by the Constitution "to take care that the laws befaithfully executed," and convinced by undoubted evidence that violationsof said act had been committed and that a widespread and flagrant disregardof it was contemplated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecutethe offenders, and troops were stationed at convenient points to aid theseofficers, if necessary, in the performance of their official duties.Complaints are made of this interference by Federal authority; but if saidamendment and act do not provide for such interference under thecircumstances as above stated, then they are without meaning, force, oreffect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse thanmockery and little better than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it dueto truth and justice to ascertain, by means of a committee, whether thealleged wrongs to colored citizens for political purposes are real or thereports thereof were manufactured for the occasion.The whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia,Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas,Mississippi, Maryland, and Virginia at the time of the election was 4,082.This embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to the Gulfof Mexico.Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the constitution ofthat State (which was adopted in 1868, and upon the approval of which byCongress the State was restored to representation as one of the States ofthe Union) provides in effect that before any amendments proposed to thisconstitution shall become a part thereof they shall be passed by twosuccessive assemblies and then submitted to and ratified by a majority ofthe electors of the State voting thereon. On the 11th of May, 1874, thegovernor convened an extra session of the general assembly of the State,which on the 18th of the same month passed an act providing for aconvention to frame a new constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at anelection held on the 30th of June, 1874, the convention was approved, anddelegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of last July andframed a new constitution, the schedule of which provided for the electionof an entire new set of State officers in a manner contrary to the thenexisting election laws of the State. On the 13th of October, 1874, thisconstitution, as therein provided, was submitted to the people for theirapproval or rejection, and according to the election returns was approvedby a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon; and at the sameelection persons were chosen to fill all the State, county, and townshipoffices. The governor elected in 1872 for the term of four years turnedover his office to the governor chosen under the new constitution,whereupon the lieutenant governor, also elected in 1872 for a term of fouryears, claiming to act as governor, and alleging that said proceedings bywhich the new constitution was made and a new set of officers elected wereunconstitutional, illegal, and void, called upon me, as provided in section4, Article IV, of the Constitution, to protect the State against domesticviolence. As Congress is now investigating the political affairs ofArkansas, I have declined to interfere.The whole subject of Executive interference with the affairs of a State isrepugnant to public opinion, to the feelings of those who, from theirofficial capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to him or thosewho must direct. Unless most clearly on the side of law, such interferencebecomes a crime; with the law to support it, it is condemned without aheating. I desire, therefore, that all necessity for Executive direction inlocal affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. I invite the attention,not of Congress, but of the people of the United States, to the causes andeffects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a disposition on one sideto magnify wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to belittle them orjustify them? If public opinion could be directed to a correct survey ofwhat is and to rebuking wrong and aiding the proper authorities inpunishing it, a better state of feeling would be inculcated, and the soonerwe would have that peace which would leave the States free indeed toregulate their own domestic affairs. I believe on the part of our citizensof the Southern States the better part of them there is a disposition tobe law abiding, and to do no violence either to individuals or to the lawsexisting. But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence andbloodshed in resistance to constituted authority? I sympathize with theirprostrate condition, and would do all in my power to relieve them,acknowledging that in some instances they have had most trying governmentsto live under, and very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for nominalimprovements, not giving benefits equal to the hardships imposed. But canthey proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for this condition? Theycan not. Violence has been rampant in some localities, and has either beenjustified or denied by those who could have prevented it. The theory iseven raised that there is to be no further interference on the part of theGeneral Government to protect citizens within a State where the Stateauthorities fail to give protection. This is a great mistake. While Iremain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of theConstitution, including the recent amendments added thereto, will beenforced with rigor, but with regret that they should have added one jot ortittle to Executive duties or powers. Let there be fairness in thediscussion of Southern questions, the advocates of both or all politicalparties giving honest, truthful reports of occurrences, condemning thewrong and upholding the tight, and soon all will be well. Under existingconditions the negro votes the Republican ticket because he knows hisfriends are of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, notbecause he agrees with the great principles of state which separateparties, but because, generally, he is opposed to negro rule. This is amost delusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is andmust remain, and soon parties will be divided, not on the color line, buton principle. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference.The report of the Attorney General contains valuable recommendationsrelating to the administration of justice in the courts of the UnitedStates, to which I invite your attention.I respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety of increasing the numberof judicial districts in the United States to eleven (the present numberbeing nine) and the creation of two additional judgeships. The territory tobe traversed by the circuit judges is so great and the business of thecourts so steadily increasing that it is growing more and more impossiblefor them to keep up with the business requiring their attention. Whetherthis would involve the necessity of adding two more justices of the SupremeCourt to the present number I submit to the judgment of Congress.The attention of Congress is invited to the report of the Secretary of theInterior and to the legislation asked for by him. The domestic interests ofthe people are more intimately connected with this Department than witheither of the other Departments of Government. Its duties have been addedto from time to time until they have become so onerous that without themost perfect system and order it will be impossible for any Secretary ofthe Interior to keep trace of all official transactions having his sanctionand done in his name, and for which he is held personally responsible.The policy adopted for the management of Indian affairs, known as the peacepolicy, has been adhered to with most beneficial results. It is confidentlyhoped that a few years more will relieve our frontiers from danger ofIndian depredations.I commend the recommendation of the Secretary for the extension of thehomestead laws to the Indians and for some sort of Territorial governmentfor the Indian Territory. A great majority of the Indians occupying thisTerritory are believed yet to be incapable of maintaining their rightsagainst the more civilized and enlightened white man. Any Territorial formof government given them, therefore, should protect them in their homes andproperty for a period of at least twenty years, and before its finaladoption should be ratified by a majority of those affected.The report of the Secretary of the Interior herewith attached gives muchinteresting statistical information, which I abstain from giving anabstract of, but refer you to the report itself.The act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must subscribe tobefore drawing their pensions cuts off from this bounty a few survivors ofthe War of 1812 residing in the Southern States. I recommend therestoration of this bounty to all such. The number of persons whose nameswould thus be restored to the list of pensioners is not large. They are allold persons, who could have taken no part in the rebellion, and theservices for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the wholecountry.The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture herewith contains suggestionsof much interest to the general public, and refers to the sly approachingCentennial and the part his Department is ready to take in it. I feel thatthe nation at large is interested in having this exposition a success, andcommend to Congress such action as will secure a greater general interestin it. Already many foreign nations have signified their intention to berepresented at it, and it may be expected that every civilized nation willbe represented.The rules adopted to improve the civil service of the Government have beenadhered to as closely as has been practicable with the opposition withwhich they meet. The effect, I believe, has been beneficial on the whole,and has tended to the elevation of the service. But it is impracticable tomaintain them without direct and positive support of Congress. Generallythe support which this reform receives is from those who give it theirsupport only to find fault when the rules are apparently departed from.Removals from office without preferring charges against parties removed arefrequently cited as departures from the rules adopted, and the retention ofthose against whom charges are made by irresponsible persons and withoutgood grounds is also often condemned as a violation of them. Under thesecircumstances, therefore, I announce that if Congress adjourns withoutpositive legislation on the subject of "civil service reform" I will regardsuch action as a disapproval of the system, and will abandon it, except sofar as to require examinations for certain appointees, to determine theirfitness. Competitive examinations will be abandoned.The gentlemen who have given their services, without compensation, asmembers of the board to devise rules and regulations for the government ofthe civil service of the country have shown much zeal and earnestness intheir work, and to them, as well as to myself, it will be a source ofmortification if it is to be thrown away. But I repeat that it isimpossible to carry this system to a successful issue without generalapproval and assistance and positive law to support it.I have stated that three elements of prosperity to the nation capital,labor, skilled and unskilled, and products of the soil still remain withus. To direct the employment of these is a problem deserving the mostserious attention of Congress. If employment can be given to all the laboroffering itself, prosperity necessarily follows. I have expressed theopinion, and repeat it, that the first requisite to the accomplishment ofthis end is the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of afluctuating value. This secured, there are many interests that might befostered to the great profit of both labor and capital. How to inducecapital to employ labor is the question. The subject of cheaptransportation has occupied the attention of Congress. Much new light onthis question will without doubt be given by the committee appointed by thelast Congress to investigate and report upon this subject.A revival of shipbuilding, and particularly of iron steamship building, isof vast importance to our national prosperity. The United States is nowpaying over $100,000,000 per annum for freights and passage on foreignships to be carried abroad and expended in the employment and support ofother peoples beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreignvessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each respectively. It isto be regretted that this disparity in the carrying trade exists, and tocorrect it I would be willing to see a great departure from the usualcourse of Government in supporting what might usually be termed privateenterprise. I would not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to Americansteamship lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compensationfor carrying the mails between Atlantic Seaboard cities and the Continenton American owned and American built steamers, and would extend thisliberality to vessels carrying the mails to South American States and toCentral America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from ourPacific seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific. It might be demandedthat vessels built for this service should come up to a standard fixed bylegislation in tonnage, speed, and all other qualities, looking to thepossibility of Government requiring them at some time for war purposes. Theright also of taking possession of them in such emergency should beguarded.I offer these suggestions, believing them worthy of consideration, in allseriousness, affecting all sections and all interests alike. If anythingbetter can be done to direct the country into a course of generalprosperity, no one will be more ready than I to second the plan.Forwarded herewith will be found the report of the commissioners appointedunder an act of Congress approved June 20, 1874, to wind up the affairs ofthe District government.

Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In submitting my seventh annual message to Congress, in this centennialyear of our national existence as a free and independent people, it affordsme great pleasure to recur to the advancement that has been made from thetime of the colonies, one hundred years ago. We were then a peoplenumbering only 3,000,000. Now we number more than 40,000,000. Thenindustries were confined almost exclusively to the tillage of the soil. Nowmanufactories absorb much of the labor of the country.Our liberties remain unimpaired; the bondmen have been freed from slavery;we have become possessed of the respect, if not the friendship, of allcivilized nations. Our progress has been great in all the arts in science,agriculture, commerce, navigation, mining, mechanics, law, medicine, etc.;and in general education the progress is likewise encouraging. Our thirteenStates have become thirty eight, including Colorado (which has taken theinitiatory steps to become a State), and eight Territories, including theIndian Territory and Alaska, and excluding Colorado, making a territoryextending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. On the south we have extendedto the Gulf of Mexico, and in the west from the Mississippi to thePacific.One hundred years ago the cotton gin, the steamship, the railroad, thetelegraph, the reaping, sewing, and modern printing machines, and numerousother inventions of scarcely less value to our business and happiness wereentirely unknown.In 1776 manufactories scarcely existed even in name in all this vastterritory. In 1870 more than 2,000,000 persons were employed inmanufactories, producing more than $2,100,000,000 of products in amountannually, nearly equal to our national debt. From nearly the whole of thepopulation of 1776 being engaged in the one occupation of agriculture, in1870 so numerous and diversified had become the occupation of our peoplethat less than 6,000,000 out of more than 40,000,000 were so engaged. Theextraordinary effect produced in our country by a resort to diversifiedoccupations has built a market for the products of fertile lands distantfrom the seaboard and the markets of the world.The American system of locating various and extensive manufactories next tothe plow and the pasture, and adding connecting railroads and steamboats,has produced in our distant interior country a result noticeable by theintelligent portions of all commercial nations. The ingenuity and skill ofAmerican mechanics have been demonstrated at home and abroad in a mannermost flattering to their pride. But for the extraordinary genius andability of our mechanics, the achievements of our agriculturists,manufacturers, and transporters throughout the country would have beenimpossible of attainment.The progress of the miner has also been great. Of coal our production hassmall; now many millions of tons are mined annually. So with iron, whichformed scarcely an appreciable part of our products half a century ago, wenow produce more than the world consumed at the beginning of our nationalexistence. Lead, zinc, and copper, from being articles of import, we mayexpect to be large exporters of in the near future. The development of goldand silver mines in the United States and Territories has not only beenremarkable, but has had a large influence upon the business of allcommercial nations. Our merchants in the last hundred years have had asuccess and have established a reputation for enterprise, sagacity,progress, and integrity unsurpassed by peoples of older nationalities. This"good name" is not confined to their homes, but goes out upon every sea andinto every port where commerce enters. With equal pride we can point to ourprogress in all of the learned professions.As we are now about to enter upon our second centennial commenting ourmanhood as a nation it is well to look back upon the past and study whatwill be best to preserve and advance our future greatness From the fall ofAdam for his transgression to the present day no nation has ever been freefrom threatened danger to its prosperity and happiness. We should look tothe dangers threatening us, and remedy them so far as lies in our power. Weare a republic whereof one man is as good as another before the law. Undersuch a form of government it is of the greatest importance that all shouldbe possessed of education and intelligence enough to cast a vote with aright understanding of its meaning. A large association of ignorant men cannot for any considerable period oppose a successful resistance to tyrannyand oppression from the educated few, but will inevitably sink intoacquiescence to the will of intelligence, whether directed by the demagogueor by priestcraft. Hence the education of the masses becomes of the firstnecessity for the preservation of our institutions. They are worthpreserving, because they have secured the greatest good to the greatestproportion of the population of any form of government yet devised. Allother forms of government approach it just in proportion to the generaldiffusion of education and independence of thought and action. As theprimary step, therefore, to our advancement in all that has marked ourprogress in the past century, I suggest for your earnest consideration, andmost earnestly recommend it, that a constitutional amendment be submittedto the legislatures of the several States for ratification, making it theduty of each of the several States to establish and forever maintain freepublic schools adequate to the education of all the children in therudimentary branches within their respective limits, irrespective of sex,color, birthplace, or religions; forbidding the teaching in said schools ofreligious, atheistic, or pagan tenets; and prohibiting the granting of anyschool funds or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by legislative,municipal, or other authority, for the benefit or in aid, directly orindirectly, of any religious sect or denomination, or in aid or for thebenefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever.In connection with this important question I would also call your attentionto the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue,will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of thenineteenth century. It is the accumulation of vast amounts of untaxedchurch property.In 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid notax, municipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000. In 1860 the amounthad doubled; in 1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without check, itis safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. Sovast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Government withoutbearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not belooked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growingcountry, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the UnitedStates, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired bycorporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estatewithout taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alludedto, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutionalauthority and through blood.I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church orcorporation, exempting only the last resting place of the dead andpossibly, with proper restrictions, church edifices.Our relations with most of the foreign powers continue on a satisfactoryand friendly footing.Increased intercourse, the extension of commerce, and the cultivation ofmutual interests have steadily improved our relations with the largemajority of the powers of the world, rendering practicable the peacefulsolution of questions which from time to time necessarily arise, leavingfew which demand extended or particular notice.The correspondence of the Department of State with our diplomaticrepresentatives abroad is transmitted herewith.I am happy to announce the passage of an act by the General Cortes ofPortugal, proclaimed since the adjournment of Congress, for the abolitionof servitude in the Portuguese colonies. It is to be hoped that suchlegislation may be another step toward the great consummation to bereached, when no man shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, under anyguise, excuse, or form of law, to hold his fellow man in bondage. I am ofopinion also that it is the duty of the United States, as contributingtoward that end, and required by the spirit of the age in which we live, toprovide by suitable legislation that no citizen of the United States shallhold slaves as property in any other country or be interested therein.Chile has made reparation in the case of the whale ship Good Return, seizedwithout sufficient cause upward of forty years ago. Though she had hithertodenied her accountability, the denial was never acquiesced in by thisGovernment, and the justice of the claim has been so earnestly contendedfor that it has been gratifying that she should have at last acknowledgedit.The arbitrator in the case of the United States steamer Montijo, for theseizure and detention of which the Government of the United States ofColombia was held accountable, has decided in favor of the claim. Thisdecision has settled a question which had been pending for several years,and which, while it continued open, might more or less disturb the goodunderstanding which it is desirable should be maintained between the twoRepublics.A reciprocity treaty with the King of the Hawaiian Islands was concludedsome months since. As it contains a stipulation that it shall not takeeffect until Congress shall enact the proper legislation for that purpose,copies of the instrument are herewith submitted, in order that, if suchshould be the pleasure of Congress, the necessary legislation upon thesubject may be adopted.In March last an arrangement was made, through Mr. Cushing, our minister inMadrid, with the Spanish Government for the payment by the latter to theUnited States of the sum of $80,000 in coin, for the purpose of the reliefof the families or persons of the ship\'s company and certain passengers ofthe Virginius. This sum was to have been paid in three installments at twomonths each. It is due to the Spanish Government that I should state thatthe payments were fully and spontaneously anticipated by that Government,and that the whole amount was paid within but a few days more than twomonths from the date of the agreement, a copy of which is herewithtransmitted. In pursuance of the terms of the adjustment, I have directedthe distribution of the amount among the parties entitled thereto,including the ship\'s company and such of the passengers as were Americancitizens. Payments are made accordingly, on the application by the partiesentitled thereto.The past year has furnished no evidence of an approaching termination ofthe ruinous conflict which has been raging for seven years in theneighboring island of Cuba. The same disregard of the laws of civilizedwarfare and of the just demands of humanity which has heretofore calledforth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom hascontinued to blacken the sad scene. Desolation, ruin, and pillage arepervading the rich fields of one of the most fertile and productive regionsof the earth, and the incendiary\'s torch, firing plantations and valuablefactories and buildings, is the agent marking the alternate advance orretreat of contending parties.The protracted continuance of this strife seriously affects the interestsof all commercial nations, but those of the United States more than others,by reason of close proximity, its larger trade and intercourse with Cuba,and the frequent and intimate personal and social relations which havegrown up between its citizens and those of the island. Moreover, theproperty of our citizens in Cuba is large, and is rendered insecure anddepreciated in value and in capacity of production by the continuance ofthe strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct. The same is true,differing only in degree, with respect to the interests and people of othernations; and the absence of any reasonable assurance of a near terminationof the conflict must of necessity soon compel the States thus suffering toconsider what the interests of their own people and their duty towardthemselves may demand.I have hoped that Spain would be enabled to establish peace in her colony,to afford security to the property and the interests of our citizens, andallow legitimate scope to trade and commerce and the natural productions ofthe island. Because of this hope, and from an extreme reluctance tointerfere in the most remote manner in the affairs of another and afriendly nation, especially of one whose sympathy and friendship in thestruggling infancy of our own existence must ever be remembered withgratitude, I have patiently and anxiously waited the progress of events.Our own civil conflict is too recent for us not to consider thedifficulties which surround a government distracted by a dynastic rebellionat home at the same time that it has to cope with a separate insurrectionin a distant colony. But whatever causes may have produced the situationwhich so grievously affects our interests, it exists, with all itsattendant evils operating directly upon this country and its people. Thusfar all the efforts of Spain have proved abortive, and time has marked noimprovement in the situation. The armed bands of either side now occupynearly the same ground as in the past, with the difference, from time totime, of more lives sacrificed, more property destroyed, and wider extentsof fertile and productive fields and more and more of valuable propertyconstantly wantonly sacrificed to the incendiary\'s torch.In contests of this nature, where a considerable body of people who haveattempted to free themselves of the control of the superior government havereached such point in occupation of territory, in power, and in generalorganization as to constitute in fact a body politic; having a governmentin substance as well as in name; possessed of the elements of stability andequipped with the machinery for the administration of internal policy andthe execution of its laws; prepared and able to administer justice at home,as well as in its dealings with other powers, it is within the province ofthose other powers to recognize its existence as a new and independentnation. In such cases other nations simply deal with an actually existingcondition of things, and recognize as one of the powers of the earth thatbody politic which, possessing the necessary elements, has in fact become anew power. In a word, the creation of a new state is a fact.To establish the condition of things essential to the recognition of thisfact there must be a people occupying a known territory, united under someknown and defined form of government, acknowledged by those subjectthereto, in which the functions of government are administered by usualmethods, competent to mete out justice to citizens and strangers, to affordremedies for public and for private wrongs, and able to assume thecorrelative international obligations and capable of performing thecorresponding international duties resulting from its acquisition of therights of sovereignty. A power should exist complete in its organization,ready to take and able to maintain its place among the nations of theearth.While conscious that the insurrection in Cuba has shown a strength andendurance which make it at least doubtful whether it be in the power ofSpain to subdue it, it seems unquestionable that no such civil organizationexists which may be recognized as an independent government capable ofperforming its international obligations and entitled to be treated as oneof the powers of the earth. A recognition under such circumstances would beinconsistent with the facts, and would compel the power granting it soon tosupport by force the government to which it had really given its only claimof existence. In my judgment the United States should adhere to the policyand the principles which have heretofore been its sure and safe guides inlike contests between revolted colonies and their mother country, and,acting only upon the clearest evidence, should avoid any possibility ofsuspicion or of imputation.A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself isthat of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to thecontest.In a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question,and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful anddevastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity ofwar. Regarding it now, after this lapse of time, I am unable to see thatany notable success or any marked or real advance on the part of theinsurgents has essentially changed the character of the contest. It hasacquired greater age, but not greater or more formidable proportions. It ispossible that the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain herself,of this very nature, might be pointed to in defense of such recognition.But now, as in its past history, the United States should carefully avoidthe false lights which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and ofquestionable propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule, whichhas been its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and ofgood report. The question of according or of withholding rights ofbelligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particularattending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and justly,regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moralsupport to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when theinterests and rights of another government or of its people are so faraffected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of itsrelations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which willbe recognized in the sense of international law as war. Belligerence, too,is a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and theiroccasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to.Applying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognizedby publicists and writers on international law, and which have beenobserved by nations of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitiveor selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection theexistence of such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, andmanifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinaryfunctions of government toward its own people and to other states, withcourts for the administration of justice, with a local habitation,possessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation ofterritory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebelliousinsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footingof war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it. Thecontest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possesseditself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag, nor has itany means of communication with foreign powers except through the militarylines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden anddifficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitateupon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consularofficers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to theparties to the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regardthe accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature asI regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right. Suchrecognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow fromit difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from thecontending parties of the strict observance of their rights andobligations; it confers the right of search upon the high seas by vesselsof both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions ofwar, which now may be transported freely and without interruption in thevessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure; itwould give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the parentGovernment from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents, and wouldinvest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by ourtreaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas, a very large part ofwhich, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and betweenall of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through the waters whichwash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could scarce failto lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peacefulrelations of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result suchsupervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of theUnited States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures ofquestionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Apart from anyquestion of theoretical right, I am satisfied that while the accordance ofbelligerent rights to the insurgents in Cuba might give them a hope and aninducement to protract the struggle, it would be but a delusive hope, andwould not remove the evils which this Government and its people areexperiencing, but would draw the United States into complications which ithas waited long and already suffered much to avoid. The recognition ofindependence or of belligerency being thus, in my judgment, equallyinadmissible, it remains to consider what course shall be adopted shouldthe conflict not soon be brought to an end by acts of the partiesthemselves, and should the evils which result therefrom, affecting allnations, and particularly the United States, continue. In such event I amof opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume theresponsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously consider the onlyremaining measures possible mediation and intervention, Owing, perhaps, tothe large expanse of water separating the island from the peninsula, thewant of harmony and of personal sympathy between the inhabitants of thecolony and those sent thither to rule them, and want of adaptation of theancient colonial system of Europe to the present times and to the ideaswhich the events of the past century have developed, the contending partiesappear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence tosuggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assumethe part of peacemaker. In this view in the earlier days of the contest thegood offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in goodfaith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and insincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined bySpain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they wouldbe indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the opinion ofSpain that time has been reached. And yet the strife continues, with allits dread horrors and all its injuries to the interests of the UnitedStates and of other nations. Each party seems quite capable of workinggreat injury and damage to the other, as well as to all the relations andinterests dependent on the existence of peace in the island; but they seemincapable of reaching any adjustment, and both have thus far failed ofachieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control theisland to the exclusion of the other. Under these circumstances the agencyof others, either by mediation or by intervention, seems to be the onlyalternative which must, sooner or later, be invoked for the termination ofthe strife. At the same time, while thus impressed I do not at this timerecommend the adoption of any measure of intervention. I shall be ready atall times, and as the equal friend of both parties, to respond to asuggestion that the good offices of the United States will be acceptable toaid in bringing about a peace honorable to both. It is due to Spain, so faras this Government is concerned, that the agency of a third power, to whichI have adverted, shall be adopted only as a last expedient. Had it been thedesire of the United States to interfere in the affairs of Cuba, repeatedopportunities for so doing have been presented within the last few years;but we have remained passive, and have performed our whole duty and allinternational obligations to Spain with friendship, fairness, and fidelity,and with a spirit of patience and forbearance which negatives everypossible suggestion of desire to interfere or to add to the difficultieswith which she has been surrounded.The Government of Spain has recently submitted to our minister at Madridcertain proposals which it is hoped may be found to be the basis, if notthe actual submission, of terms to meet the requirements of the particulargriefs of which this Government has felt itself entitled to complain. Theseproposals have not yet reached me in their full text. On their arrival theywill be taken into careful examination, and may, I hope, lead to asatisfactory adjustment of the questions to which they refer and remove thepossibility of future occurrences such as have given rise to our justcomplaints.It is understood also that renewed efforts are being made to introducereforms in the internal administration of the island. Persuaded, however,that a proper regard for the interests of the United States and of itscitizens entitles it to relief from the strain to which it has beensubjected by the difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and losseswhich arise from the contest in Cuba, and that the interests of humanityitself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole island shall belaid waste and larger sacrifices of life be made, I shall feel it my duty,should my hopes of a satisfactory adjustment and of the early restorationof peace and the removal of future causes of complaint be, unhappily,disappointed, to make a further communication to Congress at some periodnot far remote, and during the present session, recommending what may thenseem to me to be necessary.The free zone, so called, several years since established by the MexicanGovernment in certain of the States of that Republic adjacent to ourfrontier, remains in full operation. It has always been materiallyinjurious to honest traffic, for it operates as an incentive to traders inMexico to supply without customs charges the wants of inhabitants on thisside of the line, and prevents the same wants from being supplied bymerchants of the United States, thereby to a considerable extent defraudingour revenue and checking honest commercial enterprise.Depredations by armed bands from Mexico on the people of Texas near thefrontier continue. Though the main object of these incursions is robbery,they frequently result in the murder of unarmed and peaceably disposedpersons, and in some instances even the United States post offices and mailcommunications have been attacked. Renewed remonstrances upon this subjecthave been addressed to the Mexican Government, but without much apparenteffect. The military force of this Government disposable for service inthat quarter is quite inadequate to effectually guard the line, even atthose points where the incursions are usually made. An experiment of anarmed vessel on the Rio Grande for that purpose is on trial, and it ishoped that, if not thwarted by the shallowness of the river and othernatural obstacles, it may materially contribute to the protection of theherdsmen of Texas.The proceedings of the joint commission under the convention between theUnited States and Mexico of the 4th of July, 1868, on the subject ofclaims, will soon be brought to a close. The result of those proceedingswill then be communicated to Congress.I am happy to announce that the Government of Venezuela has, upon furtherconsideration, practically abandoned its objection to pay to the UnitedStates that share of its revenue which some years since it allotted towardthe extinguishment of the claims of foreigners generally. In thusreconsidering its determination that Government has shown a just sense ofself respect which can not fail to reflect credit upon it in the eyes ofall disinterested persons elsewhere. It is to be regretted, however, thatits payments on account of claims of citizens of the United States arestill so meager in amount, and that the stipulations of the treaty inregard to the sums to be paid and the periods when those payments were totake place should have been so signally disregarded.Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratificationof a treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium, and of conventionswith the Mexican Republic for the further extension of the joint commissionrespecting claims; with the Hawaiian Islands for commercial reciprocity,and with the Ottoman Empire for extradition; all of which have been dulyproclaimed.The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims has prosecuted its importantduties very assiduously and very satisfactorily. It convened and wasorganized on the 22d day of July, 1874, and by the terms of the act underwhich it was created was to exist for one year from that date. The actprovided, however, that should it be found impracticable to complete thework of the court before the expiration of the year the President might byproclamation extend the time of its duration to a period not more than sixmonths beyond the expiration of the one year.Having received satisfactory evidence that it would be impracticable tocomplete the work within the time originally fixed, I issued a proclamation(a copy of which is presented herewith) extending the time of duration ofthe court for a period of six months from and after the 22d day of Julylast.A report made through the clerk of the court (communicated herewith) showsthe condition of the calendar on the 1st of November last and the largeamount of work which has been accomplished. One thousand three hundred andeighty two claims have been presented, of which 682 had been disposed of atthe date of the report. I am informed that 170 cases were decided duringthe month of November. Arguments are being made and decisions given in theremaining cases with all the dispatch consistent with the properconsideration of the questions submitted. Many of these claims are inbehalf of mariners, or depend on the evidence of mariners, whose absencehas delayed the taking or the return of the necessary evidence.It is represented to me that it will be impracticable for the court tofinally dispose of all the cases before it within the present limit of itsduration. Justice to the parties claimant, who have been at large expensein preparing their claims and obtaining the evidence in their support,suggests a short extension, to enable the court to dispose of all of theclaims which have been presented.I recommend the legislation which may be deemed proper to enable the courtto complete the work before it.I recommend that some suitable provision be made, by the creation of aspecial court or by conferring the necessary jurisdiction upon someappropriate tribunal, for the consideration and determination of the claimsof aliens against the Government of the United States which have arisenwithin some reasonable limitation of time, or which may hereafter arise,excluding all claims barred by treaty provisions or otherwise. It has beenfound impossible to give proper consideration to these claims by theExecutive Departments of the Government. Such a tribunal would afford anopportunity to aliens other than British subjects to present their claimson account of acts committed against their persons or property during therebellion, as also to those subjects of Great Britain whose claims, havingarisen subsequent to the 9th day of April, 1865, could not be presented tothe late commission organized pursuant to the provisions of the treaty ofWashington.The electric telegraph has become an essential and indispensable agent inthe transmission of business and social messages. Its operation on land,and within the limit of particular states, is necessarily under the controlof the jurisdiction within which it operates. The lines on the high seas,however, are not subject to the particular control of any one government.In 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a companywhich proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the UnitedStates. At that time there was a telegraphic connection between the UnitedStates and the continent of Europe (through the possessions of GreatBritain at either end of the line), under the control of an associationwhich had, at large outlay of capital and at great risk, demonstrated thepracticability of maintaining such means of communication. The cost ofcorrespondence by this agency was great, possibly not too large at the timefor a proper remuneration for so hazardous and so costly an enterprise. Itwas, however, a heavy charge upon a means of communication which theprogress in the social and commercial intercourse of the world found to bea necessity, and the obtaining of this French concession showed that othercapital than that already invested was ready to enter into competition,with assurance of adequate return for their outlay. Impressed with theconviction that the interests, not only of the people of the United States,but of the world at large, demanded, or would demand, the multiplication ofsuch means of communication between separated continents, I was desirousthat the proposed connection should be made; but certain provisions of thisconcession were deemed by me to be objectionable, particularly one whichgave for a long term of years the exclusive right of telegraphiccommunication by submarine cable between the shores of France and theUnited States. I could not concede that any power should claim the right toland a cable on the shores of the United States and at the same time denyto the United States, or to its citizens or grantees, an equal fight toland a cable on its shores. The right to control the conditions for thelaying of a cable within the jurisdictional waters of the United States, toconnect our shores with those of any foreign state, pertains exclusively tothe Government of the United States, under such limitations and conditionsas Congress may impose. In the absence of legislation by Congress I wasunwilling, on the one hand, to yield to a foreign state the right to saythat its grantees might land on our shores while it denied a similar rightto our people to land on its shores, and, on the other hand, I wasreluctant to deny to the great interests of the world and of civilizationthe facilities of such communication as were proposed. I therefore withheldany resistance to the landing of the cable on condition that the offensivemonopoly feature of the concession be abandoned, and that the right of anycable which may be established by authority of this Government to land uponFrench territory and to connect with French land lines and enjoy all thenecessary facilities or privileges incident to the use thereof upon asfavorable terms as any other company be conceded. As the result thereof thecompany in question renounced the exclusive privilege, and therepresentative of France was informed that, understanding thisrelinquishment to be construed as granting the entire reciprocity and equalfacilities which had been demanded, the opposition to the landing of thecable was withdrawn. The cable, under this French concession, was landed inthe month of July, 1869, and has been an efficient and valuable agent ofcommunication between this country and the other continent. It soon passedunder the control, however, of those who had the management of the cableconnecting Great Britain with this continent, and thus whatever benefit tothe public might have ensued from competition between the two lines waslost, leaving only the greater facilities of an additional line and theadditional security in case of accident to one of them. But these increasedfacilities and this additional security, together with the control of thecombined capital of the two companies, gave also greater power to preventthe future construction of other lines and to limit the control oftelegraphic communication between the two continents to those possessingthe lines already laid. Within a few months past a cable has been laid,known as the United States Direct Cable Company, connecting the UnitedStates directly with Great Britain. As soon as this cable was reported tobe laid and in working order the rates of the then existing consolidatedcompanies were greatly reduced. Soon, however, a break was announced inthis new cable, and immediately the rates of the other line, which had beenreduced, were again raised. This cable being now repaired, the rates appearnot to be reduced by either line from those formerly charged by theconsolidated companies.There is reason to believe that large amounts of capital, both at home andabroad, are ready to seek profitable investment in the advancement of thisuseful and most civilizing means of intercourse and correspondence. Theyawait, however, the assurance of the means and conditions on which they maysafely be made tributary to the general good.As these cable telegraph lines connect separate states, there are questionsas to their organization and control which probably can be best, if notsolely, settled by conventions between the respective states. In theabsence, however, of international conventions on the subject, municipallegislation may secure many points which appear to me important, if notindispensable for the protection of the public against the extortions whichmay result from a monopoly of the right of operating cable telegrams orfrom a combination between several lines:I. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United Statesunder the concession from another power which does not admit the right ofany other line or lines, formed in the United States, to land and freelyconnect with and operate through its land lines.II. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United Stateswhich is not, by treaty stipulation with the government from whose shoresit proceeds, or by prohibition in its charter, or otherwise to thesatisfaction of this Government, prohibited from consolidating oramalgamating with any other cable telegraph line, or combining therewithfor the purpose of regulating and maintaining the cost of telegraphing.III. All lines should be bound to give precedence in the transmission ofthe official messages of the governments of the two countries between whichit may be laid.IV. A power should be reserved to the two governments, either conjointly orto each, as regards the messages dispatched from its shores, to fix a limitto the charges to be demanded for the transmission of messages.I present this subject to the earnest consideration of Congress.In the meantime, and unless Congress otherwise direct, I shall not opposethe landing of any telegraphic cable which complies with and assents to thepoints above enumerated, but will feel it my duty to prevent the landing ofany which does not conform to the first and second points as stated, andwhich will not stipulate to concede to this Government the precedence inthe transmission of its official messages and will not enter into asatisfactory arrangement with regard to its charges.Among the pressing and important subjects to which, in my opinion, theattention of Congress should be directed are those relating to fraudulentnaturalization and expatriation.The United States, with great liberality, offers its citizenship to all whoin good faith comply with the requirements of law. These requirements areas simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilegeto which he is admitted can or should permit. I do not propose anyadditional requirements to those which the law now demands; but the verysimplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have madefraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to the discredit and injury ofall honest citizens, whether native or naturalized. Cases of this characterare continually being brought to the notice of the Government by ourrepresentatives abroad, and also those of persons resident in othercountries, most frequently those who, if they have remained in this countrylong enough to entitle them to become naturalized, have generally not muchoverpassed that period, and have returned to the country of their origin,where they reside, avoiding all duties to the United States by theirabsence, and claiming to be exempt from all duties to the country of theirnativity and of their residence by reason of their alleged naturalization.It is due to this Government itself and to the great mass of thenaturalized citizens who entirely, both in name and in fact, becomecitizens of the United States that the high privilege of citizenship of theUnited States should not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws andof the good name of every honest citizen. On many occasions it has beenbrought to the knowledge of the Government that certificates ofnaturalization are held and protection or interference claimed by partieswho admit that not only they were not within the United States at the timeof the pretended naturalization, but that they have never resided in theUnited States; in others the certificate and record of the court show ontheir face that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided therequired time in the United States; in others it is admitted uponexamination that the requirements of law have not been complied with; insome cases, even, such certificates have been matter of purchase. These arenot isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common occurrence,and which are reported from all quarters of the globe. Such occurrences cannot, and do not, fail to reflect upon the Government and injure all honestcitizens. Such a fraud being discovered, however, there is no practicablemeans within the control of the Government by which the record ofnaturalization can be vacated; and should the certificate be taken up, asit usually is, by the diplomatic and consular representatives of theGovernment to whom it may have been presented, there is nothing to preventthe person claiming to have been naturalized from obtaining a newcertificate from the court in place of that which has been taken from him.The evil has become so great and of such frequent occurrence that I can nottoo earnestly recommend that some effective measures be adopted to providea proper remedy and means for the vacating of any record thus fraudulentlymade, and of punishing the guilty parties to the transaction.In this connection I refer also to the question of expatriation and theelection of nationality.The United States was foremost in upholding the right of expatriation, andwas principally instrumental in overthrowing the doctrine of perpetualallegiance. Congress has declared the right of expatriation to be a naturaland inherent right of all people; but while many other nations have enactedlaws providing what formalities shall be necessary to work a change ofallegiance, the United States has enacted no provisions of law and has inno respect marked out how and when expatriation may be accomplished by itscitizens. Instances are brought to the attention of the Government wherecitizens of the United States, either naturalized or native born, haveformally become citizens or subjects of foreign powers, but who,nevertheless, in the absence of any provisions of legislation on thisquestion, when involved in difficulties or when it seems to be theirinterest, claim to be citizens of the United States and demand theintervention of a Government which they have long since abandoned and towhich for years they have rendered no service nor held themselves in anyway amenable.In other cases naturalized citizens, immediately after naturalization, havereturned to their native country; have become engaged in business; haveaccepted offices or pursuits inconsistent with American citizenship, andevidence no intent to return to the United States until called upon todischarge some duty to the country where they are residing, when at oncethey assert their citizenship and call upon the representatives of theGovernment to aid them in their unjust pretensions. It is but justice toall bona fide citizens that no doubt should exist on such questions, andthat Congress should determine by enactment of law how expatriation may beaccomplished and change of citizenship be established.I also invite your attention to the necessity of regulating by law thestatus of American women who may marry foreigners, and of defining morefully that of children born in a foreign country of American parents whomay reside abroad; and also of some further provision regulating or givinglegal effect to marriages of American citizens contracted in foreigncountries. The correspondence submitted herewith shows a few of theconstantly occurring questions on these points presented to theconsideration of the Government. There are few subjects to engage theattention of Congress on which more delicate relations or more importantinterests are dependent.In the month of July last the building erected for the Department of Statewas taken possession of and occupied by that Department. I am happy toannounce that the archives and valuable papers of the Government in thecustody of that Department are now safely deposited and properly caredfor.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts from customsfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, to have been $163,103,833.69, andfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, to have been $157,267,722.35, adecrease for the last fiscal year of $5,936,111.34. Receipts from internalrevenue for the year ending the 30th of June, 1874, were $102,409,784.90,and for the year ending June 30, 1875, $110,007,493.58; increase,$7,597,708.68.The report also shows a complete history of the workings of the Departmentfor the last year, and contains recommendations for reforms and forlegislation which I concur in, but can not comment on so fully as I shouldlike to do if space would permit, but will confine myself to a fewsuggestions which I look upon as vital to the best interests of the wholepeople coming within the purview of "Treasury;" I mean specie resumption.Too much stress can not be laid upon this question, and I hope Congress maybe induced, at the earliest day practicable, to insure the consummation ofthe act of the last Congress, at its last session, to bring about specieresumption "on and after the 1st of January, 1879," at furthest. It wouldbe a great blessing if this could be consummated even at an earlier day.Nothing seems to me more certain than that a full, healthy, and permanentreaction can not take place in favor of the industries and financialwelfare of the country until we return to a measure of values recognizedthroughout the civilized world. While we use a currency not equivalent tothis standard the world\'s recognized standard, specie, becomes a commoditylike the products of the soil, the surplus seeking a market wherever thereis a demand for it.Under our present system we should want none, nor would we have any, wereit not that customs dues must be paid in coin and because of the pledge topay interest on the public debt in coin. The yield of precious metals wouldflow out for the purchase of foreign productions and the United States"hewers of wood and drawers of water," because of wiser legislation on thesubject of finance by the nations with whom we have dealings. I am notprepared to say that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the endmost heartily recommended. It will be a source of great gratification to meto be able to approve any measure of Congress looking effectively towardsecuring "resumption."Unlimited inflation would probably bring about specie payments morespeedily than any legislation looking to redemption of the legal tenders incoin; but it would be at the expense of honor. The legal tenders would haveno value beyond settling present liabilities, or, properly speaking,repudiating them. They would buy nothing after debts were all settled.There are a few measures which seem to me important in this connection andwhich I commend to your earnest consideration:A repeal of so much of the legal tender act as makes these notes receivablefor debts contracted after a date to be fixed in the act itself, say notlater than the 1st of January, 1877. We should then have quotations at realvalues, not fictitious ones. Gold would no longer be at a premium, butcurrency at a discount. A healthy reaction would set in at once, and withit a desire to make the currency equal to what it purports to be. Themerchants, manufacturers, and tradesmen of every calling could do businesson a fair margin of profit, the money to be received having an unvaryingvalue. Laborers and all classes who work for stipulated pay or salary wouldreceive more for their income, because extra profits would no longer becharged by the capitalists to compensate for the risk of a downwardfluctuation in the value of the currency.Second. That the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to redeem, say,not to exceed $2,000,000 monthly of legal tender notes, by issuing in theirstead a long bond, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent per annum,of denominations ranging from $50 up to $1,000 each. This would in timereduce the legal tender notes to a volume that could be kept afloat withoutdemanding redemption in large sums suddenly.Third. That additional power be given to the Secretary of the Treasury toaccumulate gold for final redemption, either by increasing revenue,curtailing expenses, or both (it is preferable to do both); and I recommendthat reduction of expenditures be made wherever it can be done withoutimpairing Government obligations or crippling the due execution thereof.One measure for increasing the revenue and the only one I think of is therestoration of the duty on tea and coffee. These duties would add probably$18,000,000 to the present amount received from imports, and would in noway increase the prices paid for those articles by the consumers.These articles are the products of countries collecting revenue fromexports, and as we, the largest consumers, reduce the duties theyproportionately increase them. With this addition to the revenue, manyduties now collected, and which give but an insignificant return for thecost of collection, might be remitted, and to the direct advantage ofconsumers at home.I would mention those articles which enter into manufactures of all sorts.All duty paid upon such articles goes directly to the cost of the articlewhen manufactured here, and must be paid for by the consumers. These dutiesnot only come from the consumers at home, but act as a protection toforeign manufacturers of the same completed articles in our own and distantmarkets.I will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of "howto enable the Secretary of the Treasury to accumulate balances." It is todevise some better method of verifying claims against the Government thanat present exists through the Court of Claims, especially those claimsgrowing out of the late war. Nothing is more certain than that a very largepercentage of the amounts passed and paid are either wholly fraudulent orare far in excess of the real losses sustained. The large amount of lossesproven on good testimony according to existing laws, by affidavits offictitious or unscrupulous persons to have been sustained on small farmsand plantations are not only far beyond the possible yield of those placesfor any one year, but, as everyone knows who has had experience in tillingthe soil and who has visited the scenes of these spoliations, are in manyinstances more than the individual claimants were ever worth, includingtheir personal and real estate.The report of the Attorney General, which will be submitted to Congress atan early day, will contain a detailed history of awards made and of claimpending of the class here referred to.The report of the Secretary of War, accompanying this message, gives adetailed account of Army operations for the year just passed, expenses formaintenance, etc., with recommendations for legislation to which Irespectfully invite your attention. To some of these I invite specialattention:First. The necessity of making $300,000 of the appropriation for theSubsistence Department available before the beginning of the next fiscalyear. Without this provision troops at points distant from supplyproduction must either go without food or existing laws must be violated.It is not attended with cost to the Treasury.Second. His recommendation for the enactment of a system of annuities forthe families of deceased officers by voluntary deductions from the monthlypay of officers. This again is not attended with burden upon the Treasury,and would for the future relieve much distress which every old army officerhas witnessed in the past of officers dying suddenly or being killed,leaving families without even the means of reaching their friends, iffortunate enough to have friends to aid them.Third. The repeal of the law abolishing mileage, and a return to the oldsystem.Fourth. The trial with torpedoes under the Corps of Engineers, andappropriation for the same. Should war ever occur between the United Statesand any maritime power, torpedoes will be among if not the most effectiveand cheapest auxiliary for the defense of harbors, and also in aggressiveoperations, that we can have. Hence it is advisable to learn by experimenttheir best construction and application, as well as effect.Fifth. A permanent organization for the Signal Service Corps. This servicehas now become a necessity of peace as well as war, under the advancementmade by the present able management.Sixth. A renewal of the appropriation for compiling the official records ofthe war, etc.The condition of our Navy at this time is a subject of satisfaction. Itdoes not contain, it is true, any of the powerful cruising ironclads whichmake so much of the maritime strength of some other nations, but neitherour continental situation nor our foreign policy requires that we shouldhave a large number of ships of this character, while this situation andthe nature of our ports combine to make those of other nations littledangerous to us under any circumstances.Our Navy does contain, however, a considerable number of ironclads of themonitor class, which, though not properly cruisers, are powerful andeffective for harbor defense and for operations near our own shores. Ofthese all the single turreted ones, fifteen in number, have beensubstantially rebuilt, their rotten wooden beams replaced with iron, theirhulls strengthened, and their engines and machinery thoroughly repaired, sothat they are now in the most efficient condition and ready for sea as soonas they can be manned and put in commission.The five double turreted ironclads belonging to our Navy, by far the mostpowerful of our ships for fighting purposes, are also in hand undergoingcomplete repairs, and could be ready for sea in periods varying from fourto six months. With these completed according to the present design and ourtwo iron torpedo boats now ready, our ironclad fleet will be, for thepurposes of defense at home, equal to any force that can readily be broughtagainst it.Of our wooden navy also cruisers of various sizes, to the number of aboutforty, including those now in commission, are in the Atlantic, and could beready for duty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not already incommission. Of these, one third are in effect new ships, and though some ofthe remainder need considerable repairs to their boilers and machinery,they all are, or can readily be made, effective.This constitutes a fleet of more than fifty war ships, of which fifteen areironclad, now in hand on the Atlantic coast. The Navy has been brought tothis condition by a judicious and practical application of what could bespared from the current appropriations of the last few years and from thatmade to meet the possible emergency of two years ago. It has been donequietly, without proclamation or display, and though it has necessarilystraitened the Department in its ordinary expenditure, and, as far as theironclads are concerned, has added nothing to the cruising force of theNavy, yet the result is not the less satisfactory because it is to be foundin a great increase of real rather than apparent force. The expensesincurred in the maintenance of an effective naval force in all its branchesare necessarily large, but such force is essential to our position,relations, and character, and affects seriously the weight of ourprinciples and policy throughout the whole sphere of nationalresponsibilities.The estimates for the regular support of this branch of the service for thenext year amount to a little less in the aggregate than those made for thecurrent year; but some additional appropriations are asked for objects notincluded in the ordinary maintenance of the Navy, but believed to be ofpressing importance at this time. It would, in my opinion, be wise at onceto afford sufficient means for the immediate completion of the fivedouble turreted monitors now undergoing repairs, which must otherwiseadvance slowly, and only as money can be spared from current expenses.Supplemented by these, our Navy, armed with the destructive weapons ofmodern warfare, manned by our seamen, and in charge of our instructedofficers, will present a force powerful for the home purposes of aresponsible though peaceful nation.The report of the Postmaster General herewith transmitted gives a fullhistory of the workings of the Department for the year just past. It willbe observed that the deficiency to be supplied from the General Treasury isincreased over the amount required for the preceding year. In a country sovast in area as the United States, with large portions sparsely settled, itmust be expected that this important service will be more or less a burdenupon the Treasury for many years to come. But there is no branch of thepublic service which interests the whole people more than that of cheap andrapid transmission of the mails to every inhabited part of our territory.Next to the free school, the post office is the great educator of thepeople, and it may well receive the support of the General Government.The subsidy of $150,000 per annum given to vessels of the United States forcarrying the mails between New York and Rio de Janeiro having ceased on the30th day of September last, we are without direct mail facilities with theSouth American States. This is greatly to be regretted, and I do nothesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract, andalso that the service may be increased from monthly to semi monthly trips.The commercial advantages to be gained by a direct line of Americansteamers to the South American States will far outweigh the expense of theservice.By act of Congress approved March 3, 1875, almost all matter, whetherproperly mail matter or not, may be sent any distance through the mails, inpackages not exceeding 4 pounds in weight, for the sum of 16 cents perpound. So far as the transmission of real mail matter goes, this would seementirely proper; but I suggest that the law be so amended as to excludefrom the mails merchandise of all descriptions, and limit thistransportation to articles enumerated, and which may be classed as mailmatter proper.The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, a portion of the SiouxReservation, has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners tothat point. Thus far the effort to protect the treaty rights of the Indiansto that section has been successful, but the next year will certainlywitness a large increase of such emigration. The negotiations for therelinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it will be necessary forCongress to adopt some measures to relieve the embarrassment growing out ofthe causes named. The Secretary of the Interior suggests that the suppliesnow appropriated for the sustenance of that people, being no longerobligatory under the treaty of 1868, but simply a gratuity, may be issuedor withheld at his discretion.The condition of the Indian Territory, to which I have referred in severalof my former annual messages, remains practically unchanged. The Secretaryof the Interior has taken measures to obtain a full report of the conditionof that Territory, and will make it the subject of a special report at anearly day. It may then be necessary to make some further recommendation inregard to legislation for the government of that Territory.The steady growth and increase of the business of the Patent Officeindicates in some measure the progress of the industrial activity of thecountry. The receipts of the office are in excess of its expenditures, andthe office generally is in a prosperous and satisfactory condition.The report of the General Land Office shows that there were 2,459,601 acresless disposed of during this than during the last year. More than one halfof this decrease was in lands disposed of under the homestead andtimber culture laws. The cause of this decrease is supposed to be found inthe grasshopper scourge and the droughts which prevailed so extensively insome of the frontier States and Territories during that time as todiscourage and deter entries by actual settlers. The cash receipts wereless by $690,322.23 than during the preceding year.The entire surveyed area of the public domain is 680,253,094 acres, ofwhich 26,077,531 acres were surveyed during the past year, leaving1,154,471,762 acres still unsurveyed.The report of the Commissioner presents many interesting suggestions inregard to the management and disposition of the public domain and themodification of existing laws, the apparent importance of which shouldinsure for them the careful consideration of Congress.The number of pensioners still continues to decrease, the highest numberhaving been reached during the year ending June 30, 1873. During the lastyear 11,557 names were added to the rolls, and 12,977 were droppedtherefrom, showing a net decrease of 1,420. But while the number ofpensioners has decreased, the annual amount due on the pension rolls hasincreased $44,733.13. This is caused by the greatly increased average rateof pensions, which, by the liberal legislation of Congress, has increasedfrom $90.26 in 1872 to $103.91 in 1875 to each invalid pensioner, anincrease in the average rate of 15 per cent in the three years. During theyear ending June 30, 1875, there was paid on account of pensions, includingthe expenses of disbursement, $29,683,116, being $910,632 less than waspaid the preceding year. This reduction in amount of expenditures wasproduced by the decrease in the amount of arrearages due on allowed claimsand on pensions the rate of which was increased by the legislation of thepreceding session of Congress. At the close of the last fiscal year therewere on the pension rolls 234,821 persons, of whom 210,363 were armypensioners, 105,478 being invalids and 104,885 widows and dependentrelatives; 3,420 were navy pensioners, of whom 1,636 were invalids and1,784 widows and dependent relatives; 21,038 were pensioners of the War of1812, 15,875 of whom were survivors and 5,163 were widows.It is estimated that $29,535,000 will be required for the payment ofpensions for the next fiscal year, an amount $965,000 less than theestimate for the present year.The geological explorations have been prosecuted with energy during theyear, covering an area of about 40,000 square miles in the Territories ofColorado, Utah, and New Mexico, developing the agricultural and mineralresources and furnishing interesting scientific and topographical detailsof that region.The method for the treatment of the Indians adopted at the beginning of myfirst term has been steadily pursued, and with satisfactory and encouragingresults. It has been productive of evident improvement in the condition ofthat race, and will be continued, with only such modifications as furtherexperience may indicate to be necessary.The board heretofore appointed to take charge of the articles and materialspertaining to the War, the Navy, the Treasury, the Interior, and thePost Office Departments, and the Department of Agriculture, the SmithsonianInstitution, and the Commission of Food Fishes, to be contributed, underthe legislation of last session, to the international exhibition to be heldat Philadelphia during the centennial year 1876, has been diligent in thedischarge of the duties which have devolved upon it; and the preparationsso far made with the means at command give assurance that the governmentalcontribution will be made one of the marked characteristics of theexhibition. The board has observed commendable economy in the matter of theerection of a building for the governmental exhibit, the expense of whichit is estimated will not exceed, say, $80,000. This amount has beenwithdrawn, under the law, from the appropriations of five of the principalDepartments, which leaves some of those Departments without sufficientmeans to render their respective practical exhibits complete andsatisfactory. The exhibition being an international one, and the Governmentbeing a voluntary contributor, it is my opinion that its contributionshould be of a character, in quality and extent, to sustain the dignity andcredit of so distinguished a contributor. The advantages to the country ofa creditable display are, in an international point of view, of the firstimportance, while an indifferent or uncreditable participation by theGovernment would be humiliating to the patriotic feelings of our peoplethemselves. I commend the estimates of the board for the necessaryadditional appropriations to the favorable consideration of Congress.The powers of Europe almost without exception, many of the South AmericanStates, and even the more distant Eastern powers have manifested theirfriendly sentiments toward the United States and the interest of the worldin our progress by taking steps to join with us in celebrating thecentennial of the nation, and I strongly recommend that a more nationalimportance be given to this exhibition by such legislation and by suchappropriation as will insure its success. Its value in bringing to ourshores innumerable useful works of art and skill, the commingling of thecitizens of foreign countries and our own, and the interchange of ideas andmanufactures will far exceed any pecuniary outlay we may make.I transmit herewith the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, togetherwith the reports of the Commissioners, the board of audit, and the board ofhealth of the District of Columbia, to all of which I invite yourattention.The Bureau of Agriculture has accomplished much in disseminating usefulknowledge to the agriculturist, and also in introducing new and usefulproductions adapted to our soil and climate, and is worthy of the continuedencouragement of the Government.The report of the Commissioner of Education, which accompanies the reportof the Secretary of the Interior, shows a gratifying progress ineducational matters.In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting toCongress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous,condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked fordefinite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free,enlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagranta crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is nolaw to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punishit as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocentchildren, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent pluralwives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.While this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another,though perhaps no less an evil the importation of Chinese women, but fewof whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or usefuloccupations.Observations while visiting the Territories of Wyoming, Utah, and Coloradoduring the past autumn convinced me that existing laws regulating thedisposition of public lands, timber, etc., and probably the mining lawsthemselves, are very defective and should be carefully amended, and at anearly day. Territory where cultivation of the soil can only be followed byirrigation, and where irrigation is not practicable the lands can only beused as pasturage, and this only where stock can reach water (to quench itsthirst), can not be governed by the same laws as to entries as lands everyacre of which is an independent estate by itself.Land must be held in larger quantities to justify the expense of conductingwater upon it to make it fruitful, or to justify utilizing it as pasturage.The timber in most of the Territories is principally confined to themountain regions, which are held for entry in small quantities only, and asmineral lands. The timber is the property of the United States, for thedisposal of which there is now no adequate law. The settler must become aconsumer of this timber, whether he lives upon the plain or engages inworking the mines. Hence every man becomes either a trespasser himself orknowingly a patron of trespassers.My opportunities for observation were not sufficient to justify me inrecommending specific legislation on these subjects, but I do recommendthat a joint committee of the two Houses of Congress, sufficiently large tobe divided into subcommittees, be organized to visit all the mining Statesand Territories during the coming summer, and that the committee shallreport to Congress at the next session such laws or amendments to laws asit may deem necessary to secure the best interests of the Government andthe people of these Territories, who are doing so much for theirdevelopment.I am sure the citizens occupying the territory described do not wish to betrespassers, nor will they be if legal ways are provided for them to becomeowners of these actual necessities of their position.As this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor oftransmitting to Congress before my successor is chosen, I will repeat orrecapitulate the questions which I deem of vital importance which may belegislated upon and settled at this session:First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of agood common school education to every child within their limits.Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported inwhole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax leviedupon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive allpersons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year1890, disfranchising none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may bevoters at the time this amendment takes effect.Third. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but eachfree within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bearits own proportion of taxation.Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importationof women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year,it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century ofour national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.Fifth. Enact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency,such as will command the respect of the world.Believing that these views will commend themselves to the great majority ofthe right thinking and patriotic citizens of the United States, I submitthe rest to Congress.
Ulysses S. Grant
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In submitting my eighth and last annual message to Congress it seems properthat I should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the events andofficial acts of the past eight years.It was my fortune, or misfortune, to be called to the office of ChiefExecutive without any previous political training. From the age of 17 I hadnever even witnessed the excitement attending a Presidential campaign buttwice antecedent to my own candidacy, and at but one of them was I eligibleas a voter.Under such circumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that errors ofjudgment must have occurred. Even had they not, differences of opinionbetween the Executive, bound by an oath to the strict performance of hisduties, and writers and debaters must have arisen. It is not necessarilyevidence of blunder on the part of the Executive because there are thesedifferences of views. Mistakes have been made, as all can see and I admit,but it seems to me oftener in the selections made of the assistantsappointed to aid in carrying out the various duties of administering theGovernment in nearly every case selected without a personal acquaintancewith the appointee, but upon recommendations of the representatives chosendirectly by the people. It is impossible, where so many trusts are to beallotted, that the right parties should be chosen in every instance.History shows that no Administration from the time of Washington to thepresent has been free from these mistakes. But I leave comparisons tohistory, claiming only that I have acted in every instance from aconscientious desire to do what was right, constitutional, within the law,and for the very best interests of the whole people. Failures have beenerrors of judgment, not of intent.My civil career commenced, too, at a most critical and difficult time. Lessthan four years before, the country had emerged from a conflict such as noother nation had ever survived. Nearly one half of the States had revoltedagainst the Government, and of those remaining faithful to the Union alarge percentage of the population sympathized with the rebellion and madean "enemy in the rear" almost as dangerous as the more honorable enemy inthe front. The latter committed errors of judgment, but they maintainedthem openly and courageously; the former received the protection of theGovernment they would see destroyed, and reaped all the pecuniary advantageto be gained out of the then existing state of affairs, many of them byobtaining contracts and by swindling the Government in the delivery oftheir goods.Immediately on the cessation of hostilities the then noble President, whohad carried the country so far through its perils, fell a martyr to hispatriotism at the hands of an assassin.The intervening time to my first inauguration was filled up with wranglingsbetween Congress and the new Executive as to the best mode of"reconstruction," or, to speak plainly, as to whether the control of theGovernment should be thrown immediately into the hands of those who had sorecently and persistently tried to destroy it, or whether the victorsshould continue to have an equal voice with them in this control.Reconstruction, as finally agreed upon, means this and only this, exceptthat the late slave was enfranchised, giving an increase, as was supposed,to the Union loving and Union supporting votes. If free in the full senseof the word, they would not disappoint this expectation. Hence at thebeginning of my first Administration the work of reconstruction, muchembarrassed by the long delay, virtually commenced. It was the work of thelegislative branch of the Government. My province was wholly in approvingtheir acts, which I did most heartily, urging the legislatures of Statesthat had not yet done so to ratify the fifteenth amendment to theConstitution. The country was laboring under an enormous debt, contractedin the suppression of rebellion, and taxation was so oppressive as todiscourage production. Another danger also threatened us a foreign war.The last difficulty had to be adjusted and was adjusted without a war andin a manner highly honorable to all parties concerned. Taxes have beenreduced within the last seven years nearly $300,000,000, and the nationaldebt has been reduced in the same time over $435,000,000. By refunding the6 per cent bonded debt for bonds bearing 5 and 4 1/2 per cent interest,respectively, the annual interest has been reduced from over $130,000,000in 1869 to but little over $100,000,000 in 1876. The balance of trade hasbeen changed from over $130,000,000 against the United States in 1869 tomore than $120,000,000 in our favor in 1876.It is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the UnitedStates will increase, not diminish, and that the pledge of Congress toresume specie payments in 1879 will be easily accomplished, even in theabsence of much desired further legislation on the subject.A policy has been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting a largeportion of the territory of the United States which has been humane and hassubstantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in aportion of Nebraska, and Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana Territories theBlack Hills region and approaches thereto. Hostilities there have grown outof the avarice of the white man, who has violated our treaty stipulationsin his search for gold. The question might be asked why the Government hasnot enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty prohibiting theoccupation of the Black Hills region by whites. The answer is simple: Thefirst immigrants to the Black Hills were removed by troops, but rumors ofrich discoveries of gold took into that region increased numbers. Gold hasactually been found in paying quantity, and an effort to remove the minerswould only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troops that might besent there to remove them. All difficulty in this matter has, however, beenremoved subject to the approval of Congress by a treaty ceding the BlackHills and approaches to settlement by citizens.The subject of Indian policy and treatment is so fully set forth by theSecretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and myviews so fully expressed therein, that I refer to their reports andrecommendations as my own.The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue on afriendly footing.Questions have arisen from time to time in the foreign relations of theGovernment, but the United States have been happily free during the pastyear from the complications and embarrassments which have surrounded someof the foreign powers.The diplomatic correspondence submitted herewith contains information as tocertain of the matters which have occupied the Government.The cordiality which attends our relations with the powers of the earth hasbeen plainly shown by the general participation of foreign nations in theexhibition which has just closed and by the exertions made by distantpowers to show their interest in and friendly feelings toward the UnitedStates in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation. The Governmentand people of the United States have not only fully appreciated thisexhibition of kindly feeling, but it may be justly and fairly expected thatno small benefits will result both to ourselves and other nations from abetter acquaintance, and a better appreciation of our mutual advantages andmutual wants.Congress at its last session saw fit to reduce the amount usuallyappropriated for foreign intercourse by withholding appropriations forrepresentatives of the United States in certain foreign countries and forcertain consular officers, and by reducing the amounts usually appropriatedfor certain other diplomatic posts, and thus necessitating a change in thegrade of the representatives. For these reasons, immediately upon thepassage of the bill making appropriations for the diplomatic and consularservice for the present fiscal year, instructions were issued to therepresentatives of the United States at Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, andto the consular officers for whom no appropriation had been made, to closetheir respective legations and consulates and cease from the performance oftheir duties; and in like manner steps were immediately taken to substitutecharge\'s d\'affaires for ministers resident in Portugal, Denmark, Greece,Switzerland, and Paraguay.While thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the foreignservice, as in other branches of the Government, I can not escape theconclusion that in some instances the withholding of appropriations willprove an expensive economy, and that the small retrenchment secured by achange of grade in certain diplomatic posts is not an adequateconsideration for the loss of influence and importance which will attendour foreign representatives under this reduction. I am of the opinion thata reexamination of the subject will cause a change in some instances in theconclusions reached on these subjects at the last session of Congress.The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, whose functions werecontinued by an act of the last session of Congress until the 1st day ofJanuary, 1877, has carried on its labors with diligence and generalsatisfaction. By a report from the clerk of the court, transmittedherewith, bearing date November 14, 1876, it appears that within the timenow allowed by law the court will have disposed of all the claims presentedfor adjudication. This report also contains a statement of the generalresults of the labors of the court to the date thereof. It is a cause ofsatisfaction that the method adopted for the satisfaction of the classes ofclaims submitted to the court, which are of long standing and justlyentitled to early consideration, should have proved successful andacceptable.It is with satisfaction that I am enabled to state that the work of thejoint commission for determining the boundary line between the UnitedStates and British possessions from the northwest angle of the Lake of theWoods to the Rocky Mountains, commenced in 1872, has been completed. Thefinal agreements of the commissioners, with the maps, have been dulysigned, and the work of the commission is complete.The fixing of the boundary upon the Pacific coast by the protocol of March10, 1873, pursuant to the award of the Emperor of Germany by Article XXXIVof the treaty of Washington, with the termination of the work of thiscommission, adjusts and fixes the entire boundary between the United Statesand the British possessions, except as to the portion of territory ceded byRussia to the United States under the treaty of 1867. The work intrusted tothe commissioner and the officers of the Army attached to the commissionhas been well and satisfactorily performed. The original of the finalagreement of the commissioners, signed upon the 29th of May, 1876, with theoriginal official "lists of astronomical stations observed," the originalofficial "list of monuments marking the international boundary line," andthe maps, records, and general reports relating to the commission, havebeen deposited in the Department of State. The official report of thecommissioner on the part of the United States, with the report of the chiefastronomer of the United States, will be submitted to Congress within ashort time.I reserve for a separate communication to Congress a statement of thecondition of the questions which lately arose with Great Britain respectingthe surrender of fugitive criminals under the treaty of 1842.The Ottoman Government gave notice, under date of January 15, 1874, of itsdesire to terminate the treaty of 1862, concerning commerce and navigation,pursuant to the provisions of the twenty second article thereof. Under thisnotice the treaty terminated upon the 5th day of June, 1876. ThatGovernment has invited negotiations toward the conclusion of a new treaty.By the act of Congress of March 23, 1874, the President was authorized,when he should receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman Governmentor that of Egypt had organized new tribunals likely to secure to citizensof the United States the same impartial justice enjoyed under the exerciseof judicial functions by diplomatic and consular officers of the UnitedStates, to suspend the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, and to acceptfor citizens of the United States the jurisdiction of the new tribunals.Satisfactory information having been received of the organization of suchnew tribunals in Egypt, I caused a proclamation to be issued upon the 27thof March last, suspending the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, inEgypt, according to the provisions of the act. A copy of the proclamationaccompanies this message. The United States has united with the otherpowers in the organization of these courts. It is hoped that thejurisdictional questions which have arisen may be readily adjusted, andthat this advance in judicial reform may be hindered by no obstacles.The necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respectingcommercial reciprocity concluded with the Hawaiian Islands in 1875 havingbeen had, the proclamation to carry into effect the convention, as providedby the act approved August 15, 1876, was duly issued upon the 9th day ofSeptember last. A copy thereof accompanies this message.The commotions which have been prevalent in Mexico for some time past, andwhich, unhappily, seem to be not yet wholly quieted, have led to complaintsof citizens of the United States of injuries by persons in authority. It ishoped, however, that these will ultimately be adjusted to the satisfactionof both Governments. The frontier of the United States in that quarter hasnot been exempt from acts of violence by citizens of one Republic on thoseof the other. The frequency of these is supposed to be increased and theiradjustment made more difficult by the considerable changes in the course ofthe lower part of the Rio Grande River, which river is a part of theboundary between the two countries. These changes have placed on eitherside of that river portions of land which by existing conventions belong tothe jurisdiction of the Government on the opposite side of the river. Thesubject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty is under considerationbetween the two Republics.The Government of the United States of Colombia has paid the award in thecase of the steamer Montijo, seized by authorities of that Government someyears since, and the amount has been transferred to the claimants.It is with satisfaction that I am able to announce that the jointcommission for the adjustment of claims between the United States andMexico under the convention of 1868, the duration of which has been severaltimes extended, has brought its labors to a close. From the report of theagent of the United States, which accompanies the papers transmittedherewith, it will be seen that within the time limited by the commission1,017 claims on the part of citizens of the United States against Mexicowere referred to the commission. Of these claims 831 were dismissed ordisallowed, and in 186 cases awards were made in favor of the claimantsagainst the Mexican Republic, amounting in the aggregate to $4,125,622.20.Within the same period 998 claims on the part of citizens of the MexicanRepublic against the United States were referred to the commission. Ofthese claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed, and in 167 cases awards weremade in favor of the claimants against the United States, amounting in theaggregate to $150,498.41.By the terms of the convention the amount of these awards is to be deductedfrom the amount awarded in favor of our citizens against Mexico, and thebalance only to be paid by Mexico to the United States, leaving the UnitedStates to make provision for this proportion of the awards in favor of itsOwn citizens.I invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary toprovide for the payment.In this connection I am pleased to be able to express the acknowledgmentsdue to Sir Edward Thornton, the umpire of the commission, who has given tothe consideration of the large number of claims submitted to him much time,unwearied patience, and that firmness and intelligence which are well knownto belong to the accomplished representative of Great Britain, and whichare likewise recognized by the representative in this country of theRepublic of Mexico.Monthly payments of a very small part of the amount due by the Governmentof Venezuela to citizens of the United States on account of claims of thelatter against that Government continue to be made with reasonablepunctuality. That Government has proposed to change the system which it hashitherto pursued in this respect by issuing bonds for part of the amount ofthe several claims. The proposition, however, could not, it is supposed,properly be accepted, at least without the consent of the holders ofcertificates of the indebtedness of Venezuela. These are so much dispersedthat it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain theirdisposition on the subject.In former messages I have called the attention of Congress to the necessityof legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to the subjectof expatriation and the election of nationality.The numbers of persons of foreign birth seeking a home in the UnitedStates, the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may, after thelapse of a reasonable time, become possessed of all the privileges ofcitizenship of the United States, and the frequent occasions which inducesuch adopted citizens to return to the country of their birth render thesubject of naturalization and the safeguards which experience has provednecessary for the protection of the honest naturalized citizen of paramountimportance. The very simplicity in the requirements of law on this questionaffords opportunity for fraud, and the want of uniformity in theproceedings and records of the various courts and in the forms of thecertificates of naturalization issued affords a constant source ofdifficulty.I suggest no additional requirements to the acquisition of citizenshipbeyond those now existing, but I invite the earnest attention of Congressto the necessity and wisdom of some provisions regarding uniformity in therecords and certificates, and providing against the frauds which frequentlytake place and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtained infraud.These provisions are needed in aid and for the protection of the honestcitizen of foreign birth, and for the want of which he is made to suffernot infrequently. The United States has insisted upon the right ofexpatriation, and has obtained, after a long struggle, an admission of theprinciple contended for by acquiescence therein on the part of many foreignpowers and by the conclusion of treaties on that subject. It is, however,but justice to the government to which such naturalized citizens haveformerly owed allegiance, as well as to the United States, that certainfixed and definite rules should be adopted governing such cases andproviding how expatriation may be accomplished.While emigrants in large numbers become citizens of the United States, itis also true that persons, both native born and naturalized, once citizensof the United States, either by formal acts or as the effect of a series offacts and circumstances, abandon their citizenship and cease to be entitledto the protection of the United States, but continue on convenientoccasions to assert a claim to protection in the absence of provisions onthese questions.And in this connection I again invite your attention to the necessity oflegislation concerning the marriages of American citizens contractedabroad, and concerning the status of American women who may marryforeigners and of children born of American parents in a foreign country.The delicate and complicated questions continually occurring with referenceto naturalization, expatriation, and the status of such persons as I haveabove referred to induce me to earnestly direct your attention again tothese subjects.In like manner I repeat my recommendation that some means be provided forthe hearing and determination of the just and subsisting claims of aliensupon the Government of the United States within a reasonable limitation,and of such as may hereafter arise. While by existing provisions of law theCourt of Claims may in certain cases be resorted to by an alien claimant,the absence of any general provisions governing all such cases and the wantof a tribunal skilled in the disposition of such cases upon recognizedfixed and settled principles, either provides no remedy in many deservingcases or compels a consideration of such claims by Congress or theexecutive department of the Government.It is believed that other governments are in advance of the United Statesupon this question, and that the practice now adopted is entirelyunsatisfactory.Congress, by an act approved the 3d day of March, 1875, authorized theinhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form a State government, withthe name of the State of Colorado, and therein provided for the admissionof said State, when formed, into the Union upon an equal footing with theoriginal States.A constitution having been adopted and ratified by the people of thatState, and the acting governor having certified to me the facts as providedby said act, together with a copy of such constitution and ordinances asprovided for in the said act, and the provisions of the said act ofCongress having been duly complied with, I issued a proclamation upon the1st of August, 1876, a copy of which is hereto annexed.The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been activelyemployed during the year in subduing, at the request of the Indian Bureau,certain wild bands of the Sioux Indian Nation and in preserving the peaceat the South during the election. The commission constituted under the actof July 24, 1876, to consider and report on the "whole subject of thereform and reorganization of the Army" met in August last, and hascollected a large mass of statistics and opinions bearing on the subjectbefore it. These are now under consideration, and their report isprogressing. I am advised, though, by the president of the commission thatit will be impracticable to comply with the clause of the act requiring thereport to be presented, through me, to Congress on the first day of thissession, as there has not yet been time for that mature deliberation whichthe importance of the subject demands. Therefore I ask that the time ofmaking the report be extended to the 29th day of January, 1877.In accordance with the resolution of August 15, 1876, the Army regulationsprepared under the act of March 1, 1875, have not been promulgated, but areheld until after the report of the above mentioned commission shall havebeen received and acted on.By the act of August 15, 1876, the cavalry force of the Army was increasedby 2,500 men, with the proviso that they should be discharged on theexpiration of hostilities. Under this authority the cavalry regiments havebeen strengthened, and a portion of them are now in the field pursuing theremnants of the Indians with whom they have been engaged during thesummer.The estimates of the War Department are made up on the basis of the numberof men authorized by law, and their requirements as shown by years ofexperience, and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau officers toprovide for all contingencies that may arise during the time for which theestimates are made. Exclusive of engineer estimates (presented inaccordance with acts of Congress calling for surveys and estimates forimprovements at various localities), the estimates now presented are aboutsix millions in excess of the appropriations for the years 1874 75 and1875 76. This increase is asked in order to provide for the increasedcavalry force (should their services be necessary), to prosecuteeconomically work upon important public buildings, to provide for armamentof fortifications and manufacture of small arms, and to replenish theworking stock in the supply departments. The appropriations for these lastnamed have for the past few years been so limited that the accumulations instore will be entirely exhausted during the present year, and it will benecessary to at once begin to replenish them.I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of theSecretary of War:First. That the claims under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies taken bythe Army during the war be removed from the offices of the Quartermasterand Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern Claims Commission.These claims are of precisely similar nature to those now before theSouthern Claims Commission, and the War Department bureaus have not theclerical force for their examination nor proper machinery for investigatingthe loyalty of the claimants.Second. That Congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for thebenefit of the families of deceased officers, and that it also provide forthe permanent organization of the Signal Service, both of which wererecommended in my last annual message.Third. That the manufacturing operations of the Ordnance Department beconcentrated at three arsenals and an armory, and that the remainingarsenals be sold and the proceeds applied to this object by the OrdnanceDepartment.The appropriations for river and harbor improvements for the current yearwere $5,015,000. With my approval, the Secretary of War directed that ofthis amount $2,000,000 should be expended, and no new works should be begunand none prosecuted which were not of national importance. Subsequentlythis amount was increased to $2,237,600, and the works are now progressingon this basis.The improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under James B.Eads and his associates, is progressing favorably. At the present timethere is a channel of 20.3 feet in depth between the jetties at the mouthof the pass and 18.5 feet at the head of the pass. Neither channel,however, has the width required before payments can be made by the UnitedStates. A commission of engineer officers is now examining these works, andtheir reports will be presented as soon as received.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that branch of the service tobe in condition as effective as it is possible to keep it with the meansand authority given the Department. It is, of course, not possible to rivalthe costly and progressive establishments of great European powers with theold material of our Navy, to which no increase has been authorized sincethe war, except the eight small cruisers built to supply the place ofothers which had gone to decay. Yet the most has been done that waspossible with the means at command; and by substantially rebuilding some ofour old ships with durable material and completely repairing and refittingour monitor fleet the Navy has been gradually so brought up that, though itdoes not maintain its relative position among the progressive navies of theworld, it is now in a condition more powerful and effective than it everhas been in time of peace.The complete repairs of our five heavy ironclads are only delayed onaccount of the inadequacy of the appropriations made last year for theworking bureaus of the Department, which were actually less in amount thanthose made before the war, notwithstanding the greatly enhanced price oflabor and materials and the increase in the cost of the naval servicegrowing out of the universal use and great expense of steam machinery. Themoney necessary for these repairs should be provided at once, that they maybe completed without further unnecessary delay and expense.When this is done, all the strength that there is in our Navy will bedeveloped and useful to its full capacity, and it will be powerful forpurposes of defense, and also for offensive action, should the necessityfor that arise within a reasonable distance from our shores.The fact that our Navy is not more modern and powerful than it is has beenmade a cause of complaint against the Secretary of the Navy by persons whoat the same time criticise and complain of his endeavors to bring the Navythat we have to its best and most efficient condition; but the good senseof the country will understand that it is really due to his practicalaction that we have at this time any effective naval force at command.The report of the Postmaster General shows the excess of expenditures(excluding expenditures on account of previous years) over receipts for thefiscal year ended June 30, 1876, to be $4,151,988.66.Estimated expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, are$36,723,432.43.Estimated revenue for same period is $30,645,165, leaving estimated excessof expenditure, to be appropriated as a deficiency, of $6,078,267.43.The Postmaster General, like his predecessor, is convinced that a change inthe basis of adjusting the salaries of postmasters of the fourth class isnecessary for the good of the service as well as for the interests of theGovernment, and urgently recommends that the compensation of the class ofpostmasters above mentioned be based upon the business of their respectiveoffices, as ascertained from the sworn returns to the Auditor of stampscanceled.A few postmasters in the Southern States have expressed great apprehensionof their personal safety on account of their connection with the postalservice, and have specially requested that their reports of apprehendeddanger should not be made public lest it should result in the loss of theirlives. But no positive testimony of interference has been submitted, exceptin the case of a mail messenger at Spartanburg, in South Carolina, whoreported that he had been violently driven away while in charge of themails on account of his political affiliations. An assistant superintendentof the Railway Mail Service investigated this case and reported that themessenger had disappeared from his post, leaving his work to be performedby a substitute. The Postmaster General thinks this case is sufficientlysuggestive to justify him in recommending that a more severe punishmentshould be provided for the offense of assaulting any person in charge ofthe mails or of retarding or otherwise obstructing them by threats ofpersonal injury."A very gratifying result is presented in the fact that the deficiency ofthis Department during the last fiscal year was reduced to $4,081,790.18,as against $6,169,938.88 of the preceding year. The difference can betraced to the large increase in its ordinary receipts (which greatly exceedthe estimates therefor) and a slight decrease in its expenditures."The ordinary receipts of the Post Office Department for the past sevenfiscal years have increased at an average of over 8 per cent per annum,while the increase of expenditures for the same period has been but about5.50 per cent per annum, and the decrease of deficiency in the revenues hasbeen at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum.The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture accompanying this messagewill be found one of great interest, marking, as it does, the greatprogress of the last century in the variety of products of the soil;increased knowledge and skill in the labor of producing, saving, andmanipulating the same to prepare them for the use of man; in theimprovements in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labors, and in aknowledge of those scientific subjects necessary to a thorough system ofeconomy in agricultural production, namely, chemistry, botany, entomology,etc. A study of this report by those interested in agriculture and derivingtheir support from it will find it of value in pointing out those articleswhich are raised in greater quantity than the needs of the world require,and must sell, therefore, for less than the cost of production, and thosewhich command a profit over cost of production because there is not anoverproduction.I call special attention to the need of the Department for a new galleryfor the reception of the exhibits returned from the Centennial Exhibition,including the exhibits donated by very many foreign nations, and to therecommendations of the Commissioner of Agriculture generally.The reports of the District Commissioners and the board of health are justreceived too late to read them and to make recommendations thereon andare herewith submitted.The international exhibition held in Philadelphia this year, incommemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of American independence,has proven a great success, and will, no doubt, be of enduring advantage tothe country. It has shown the great progress in the arts, sciences, andmechanical skill made in a single century, and demonstrated that we are butlittle behind older nations in any one branch, while in some we scarcelyhave a rival. It has served, too, not only to bring peoples and products ofskill and labor from all parts of the world together, but in bringingtogether people from all sections of our own country, which must prove agreat benefit in the information imparted and pride of country engendered.It has been suggested by scientists interested in and connected with theSmithsonian Institution, in a communication herewith, that the Governmentexhibit be removed to the capital and a suitable building be erected orpurchased for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit. I earnestlyrecommend this; and believing that Congress would second this view, Idirected that all Government exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition shouldremain where they are, except such as might be injured by remaining in abuilding not intended as a protection in inclement weather, or such as maybe wanted by the Department furnishing them, until the question ofpermanent exhibition is acted on.Although the moneys appropriated by Congress to enable the participation ofthe several Executive Departments in the International Exhibition of 1876were not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full extent atfirst contemplated, it gives me pleasure to refer to the very efficient andcreditable manner in which the board appointed from these severalDepartments to provide an exhibition on the part of the Government havedischarged their duties with the funds placed at their command. Without aprecedent to guide them in the preparation of such a display, the successof their labors was amply attested by the sustained attention which thecontents of the Government building attracted during the period of theexhibition from both foreign and native visitors.I am strongly impressed with the value of the collection made by theGovernment for the purposes of the exhibition, illustrating, as it does,the mineral resources of the country, the statistical and practicalevidences of our growth as a nation, and the uses of the mechanical artsand the applications of applied science in the administration of theaffairs of Government.Many nations have voluntarily contributed their exhibits to the UnitedStates to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition Congress mayprovide for. For this act of generosity they should receive the thanks ofthe people, and I respectfully suggest that a resolution of Congress tothat effect be adopted.The attention of Congress can not be too earnestly called to the necessityof throwing some greater safeguard over the method of choosing anddeclaring the election of a President. Under the present system there seemsto be no provided remedy for contesting the election in any one State. Theremedy is partially, no doubt, in the enlightenment of electors. Thecompulsory support of the free school and the disfranchisement of all whocan not read and write the English language, after a fixed probation, wouldmeet my hearty approval. I would not make this apply, however, to thosealready voters, but I would to all becoming so after the expiration of theprobation fixed upon. Foreigners coming to this country to become citizens,who are educated in their own language, should acquire the requisiteknowledge of ours during the necessary residence to obtain naturalization.If they did not take interest enough in our language to acquire sufficientknowledge of it to enable them to study the institutions and laws of thecountry intelligently, I would not confer upon them the right to make suchlaws nor to select those who do.I append to this message, for convenient reference, a synopsis ofadministrative events and of all recommendations to Congress made by meduring the last seven years. Time may show some of these recommendationsnot to have been wisely conceived, but I believe the larger part will do nodiscredit to the Administration. One of these recommendations met with theunited opposition of one political party in the Senate and with a strongopposition from the other, namely, the treaty for the annexation of SantoDomingo to the United States, to which I will specially refer, maintaining,as I do, that if my views had been concurred in the country would be in amore prosperous condition to day, both politically and financially.Santo Domingo is fertile, and upon its soil may be grown just thosetropical products of which the United States use so much, and which areproduced or prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively,namely, sugar, coffee, dyewoods, mahogany, tropical fruits, tobacco, etc.About 75 per cent of the exports of Cuba are consumed in the United States.A large percentage of the exports of Brazil also find the same market.These are paid for almost exclusively in coin, legislation, particularly inCuba, being unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the products of eachcountry. Flour shipped from the Mississippi River to Havana can pass by thevery entrance to the city on its way to a port in Spain, there pay a dutyfixed upon articles to be reexported, transferred to a Spanish vessel andbrought back almost to the point of starting, paying a second duty, andstill leave a profit over what would be received by direct shipment. Allthat is produced in Cuba could be produced in Santo Domingo. Being a partof the United States, commerce between the island and mainland would befree. There would be no export duties on her shipments nor import duties onthose coming here. There would be no import duties upon the supplies,machinery, etc., going from the States. The effect that would have beenproduced upon Cuban commerce, with these advantages to a rival, isobservable at a glance. The Cuban question would have been settled long agoin favor of "free Cuba." Hundreds of American vessels would now beadvantageously used in transporting the valuable woods and other productsof the soil of the island to a market and in carrying supplies andemigrants to it. The island is but sparsely settled, while it has an areasufficient for the profitable employment of several millions of people. Thesoil would have soon fallen into the hands of United States capitalists.The products are so valuable in commerce that emigration there would havebeen encouraged; the emancipated race of the South would have found there acongenial home, where their civil rights would not be disputed and wheretheir labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them couldhave found the means to go. Thus in cases of great oppression and cruelty,such as has been practiced upon them in many places within the last elevenyears, whole communities would have sought refuge in Santo Domingo. I donot suppose the whole race would have gone, nor is it desirable that theyshould go. Their labor is desirable indispensable almost where they noware. But the possession of this territory would have left the negro "masterof the situation," by enabling him to demand his rights at home on pain offinding them elsewhere.I do not present these views now as a recommendation for a renewal of thesubject of annexation, but I do refer to it to vindicate my previous actionin regard to it.With the present term of Congress my official life terminates. It is notprobable that public affairs will ever again receive attention from mefurther than as a citizen of the Republic, always taking a deep interest inthe honor, integrity, and prosperity of the whole land.
Rutherford B. Hayes
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:With devout gratitude to the bountiful Giver of All Good, I congratulateyou that at the beginning of your first regular session you find ourcountry blessed with health and peace and abundant harvests, and withencouraging prospects of an early return of general prosperity.To complete and make permanent the pacification of the country continues tobe, and until it is fully accomplished must remain, the most important ofall our national interests. The earnest purpose of good citizens generallyto unite their efforts in this endeavor is evident. It found decidedexpression in the resolutions announced in 1876 by the national conventionsof the leading political parties of the country. There was a widespreadapprehension that the momentous results in our progress as a nation markedby the recent amendments to the Constitution were in imminent jeopardy;that the good understanding which prompted their adoption, in the interestof a loyal devotion to the general welfare, might prove a barren truce, andthat the two sections of the country, once engaged in civil strife, mightbe again almost as widely severed and disunited as they were when arrayedin arms against each other.The course to be pursued, which, in my judgment, seemed wisest in thepresence of this emergency, was plainly indicated in my inaugural address.It pointed to the time, which all our people desire to see, when a genuinelove of our whole country and of all that concerns its true welfare shallsupplant the destructive forces of the mutual animosity of races and ofsectional hostility. Opinions have differed widely as to the measures bestcalculated to secure this great end. This was to be expected. The measuresadopted by the Administration have been subjected to severe and variedcriticism. Any course whatever which might have been entered upon wouldcertainly have encountered distrust and opposition. These measures were, inmy judgment, such as were most in harmony with the Constitution and withthe genius of our people, and best adapted, under all the circumstances, toattain the end in view. Beneficent results, already apparent, prove thatthese endeavors are not to be regarded as a mere experiment, and shouldsustain and encourage us in our efforts. Already, in the brief period whichhas elapsed, the immediate effectiveness, no less than the justice, of thecourse pursued is demonstrated, and I have an abiding faith that time willfurnish its ample vindication in the minds of the great majority of myfellow citizens. The discontinuance of the use of the Army for the purposeof upholding local governments in two States of the Union was no less aconstitutional duty and requirement, under the circumstances existing atthe time, than it was a much needed measure for the restoration of localself government and the promotion of national harmony. The withdrawal ofthe troops from such employment was effected deliberately, and withsolicitous care for the peace and good order of society and the protectionof the property and persons and every right of all classes of citizens.The results that have followed are indeed significant and encouraging. Allapprehension of danger from remitting those States to local self governmentis dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds of the people hasbegun and is in progress in every part of that section of the country oncethe theater of unhappy civil strife, substituting for suspicion, distrust,and aversion, concord, friendship, and patriotic attachment to the Union.No unprejudiced mind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collisionswhich for several years have been of frequent occurrence and have agitatedand alarmed the public mind have almost entirely ceased, and that a spiritof mutual forbearance and hearty national interest has succeeded. There hasbeen a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly administrationof justice. Instances of remaining lawlessness have become of rareoccurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have disappeared; usefulindustries have been resumed; public credit in the Southern States has beengreatly strengthened, and the encouraging benefits of a revival of commercebetween the sections of the country lately embroiled in civil war are fullyenjoyed. Such are some of the results already attained, upon which thecountry is to be congratulated. They are of such importance that we maywith confidence patiently await the desired consummation that will surelycome with the natural progress of events.It may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed andunalterable determination to protect by all available and proper meansunder the Constitution and the laws the lately emancipated race in theenjoyment of their rights and privileges; and I urge upon those to whomheretofore the colored people have sustained the relation of bondmen thewisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation with respect totheir education and general welfare. A firm adherence to the laws, bothnational and State, as to the civil and political rights of the coloredpeople, now advanced to full and equal citizenship; the immediaterepression and sure punishment by the national and local authorities,within their respective jurisdictions, of every instance of lawlessness andviolence toward them, is required for the security alike of both races, andis justly demanded by the public opinion of the country and the age. Inthis way the restoration of harmony and good will and the completeprotection of every citizen in the full enjoyment of every constitutionalright will surely be attained. Whatever authority rests with me to this endI shall not hesitate to put forth.Whatever belongs to the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of thecourts of the Union, they may confidently be relied upon to provide andperform; and to the legislatures, the courts, and the executive authoritiesof the several States I earnestly appeal to secure, by adequate,appropriate, and seasonable means, Within their borders, these common anduniform rights of a united people which loves liberty, abhors oppression,and reveres justice. These objects are very dear to my heart. I shallcontinue most earnestly to strive for their attainment. The cordialcooperation of all classes, of all sections of the country and of bothraces, is required for this purpose; and with these blessings assured, andnot otherwise, we may safely hope to hand down our free institutions ofgovernment unimpaired to the generations that will succeed us.Among the other subjects of great and general importance to the people ofthis country, I can not be mistaken, I think, in regarding as preeminentthe policy and measures which are designed to secure the restoration of thecurrency to that normal and healthful condition in which, by the resumptionof specie payments, our internal trade and foreign commerce may be broughtinto harmony with the system of exchanges which is based upon the preciousmetals as the intrinsic money of the world. In the public judgment thatthis end should be sought and compassed as speedily and securely as theresources of the people and the wisdom of their Government can accomplish,there is a much greater degree of unanimity than is found to concur in thespecific measures which will bring the country to this desired end or therapidity of the steps by which it can be safely reached.Upon a most anxious and deliberate examination, which I have felt it myduty to give to the subject, I am but the more confirmed in the opinionwhich I expressed in accepting the nomination for the Presidency, and againupon my inauguration, that the policy of resumption should be pursued byevery suitable means, and that no legislation would be wise that shoulddisparage the importance or retard the attainment of that result. I have nodisposition, and certainly no right, to question the sincerity or theintelligence of opposing opinions, and would neither conceal nor undervaluethe considerable difficulties, and even occasional distresses, which mayattend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to itsgeneral and permanent prosperity. I must, however, adhere to my mostearnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness in methods,so far from avoiding or reducing the inconvenience inseparable from thetransition from an irredeemable to a redeemable paper currency, would onlytend to increased and prolonged disturbance in values, and unless retrievedmust end in serious disorder, dishonor, and disaster in the financialaffairs of the Government and of the people.The mischiefs which I apprehend and urgently deprecate are confined to noclass of the people, indeed, but seem to me most certainly to threaten theindustrious masses, whether their occupations are of skilled or commonlabor. To them, it seems to me, it is of prime importance that their laborshould be compensated in money which is itself fixed in exchangeable valueby being irrevocably measured by the labor necessary to its production.This permanent quality of the money of the people is sought for, and canonly be gained by the resumption of specie payments. The rich, thespeculative, the operating, the money dealing classes may not always feelthe mischiefs of, or may find casual profits in, a variable currency, butthe misfortunes of such a currency to those who are paid salaries or wagesare inevitable and remediless.Closely connected with this general subject of the resumption of speciepayments is one of subordinate, but still of grave, importance; I mean thereadjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of the silver dollar asan element in our specie currency, endowed by legislation with the qualityof legal tender to a greater or less extent.As there is no doubt of the power of Congress under the Constitution "tocoin money and regulate the value thereof," and as this power covers thewhole range of authority applicable to the metal, the rated value and thelegal tender quality which shall be adopted for the coinage, theconsiderations which should induce or discourage a particular measureconnected with the coinage, belong clearly to the province of legislativediscretion and of public expediency. Without intruding upon this provinceof legislation in the least, I have yet thought the subject of suchcritical importance, in the actual condition of our affairs, as to presentan occasion for the exercise of the duty imposed by the Constitution on thePresident of recommending to the consideration of Congress "such measuresas he shall judge necessary and expedient."Holding the opinion, as I do, that neither the interests of the Governmentnor of the people of the United States would be promoted by disparagingsilver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of theworld, and that legislation which looks to maintaining the volume ofintrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as their relativecommercial values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient, Imust ask your indulgence to a brief and definite statement of certainessential features in any such legislative measure which I feel it my dutyto recommend.I do not propose to enter the debate, represented on both sides by suchable disputants in Congress and before the people and in the press, as tothe extent to which the legislation of any one nation can control thisquestion, even within its own borders, against the unwritten laws of tradeor the positive laws of other governments. The wisdom of Congress inshaping any particular law that may be presented for my approval may whollysupersede the necessity of my entering into these considerations, and Iwillingly avoid either vague or intricate inquiries. It is only certainplain and practical traits of such legislation that I desire to recommendto your attention.In any legislation providing for a silver coinage, regulating its value,and imparting to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to me of greatimportance that Congress should not lose sight of its action as operatingin a twofold capacity and in two distinct directions. If the United StatesGovernment were free from a public debt, its legislative dealing with thequestion of silver coinage would be purely sovereign and governmental,under no restraints but those of constitutional power and the public goodas affected by the proposed legislation. But in the actual circumstances ofthe nation, with a vast public debt distributed very widely among our owncitizens and held in great amounts also abroad, the nature of thesilver coinage measure, as affecting this relation of the Government to theholders of the public debt, becomes an element, in any proposedlegislation, of the highest concern. The obligation of the public faithtranscends all questions of profit or public advantage otherwise. Itsunquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediencyas of the most necessary duty, and will ever be carefully guarded byCongress and people alike.The public debt of the United States to the amount of $729,000,000 bearsinterest at the rate of 6 per cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate of 5 percent, and the only way in which the country can be relieved from thepayment of these high rates of interest is by advantageously refunding theindebtedness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or in silver coinis of but little moment compared with the possible reduction of interestone third by refunding it at such reduced rate. If the United States hadthe unquestioned right to pay its bonds in silver coin, the little benefitfrom that process would be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect ofsuch payment if made or proposed against the honest convictions of thepublic creditors.All the bonds that have been issued since February 12, 1873, when goldbecame the only unlimited legal tender metallic currency of the country,are justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value. During the timeof these issues the only dollar that could be or was received by theGovernment in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To require the publiccreditors to take in repayment any dollar of less commercial value would beregarded by them as a repudiation of the full obligation assumed. The bondsissued prior to 1873 were issued at a time when the gold dollar was theonly coin in circulation or contemplated by either the Government or theholders of the bonds as the coin in which they were to be paid. It is farbetter to pay these bonds in that coin than to seem to take advantage ofthe unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver cointhus made so much less valuable. The power of the United States to coinmoney and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be exercised for thepurpose of enabling the Government to pay its obligations in a coin of lessvalue than that contemplated by the parties when the bonds were issued. Anyattempt to pay the national indebtedness in a coinage of less commercialvalue than the money of the world would involve a violation of the publicfaith and work irreparable injury to the public credit.It was the great merit of the act of March, 1869, in strengthening thepublic credit, that it removed all doubt as to the purpose of the UnitedStates to pay their bonded debt in coin. That act was accepted as a pledgeof public faith. The Government has derived great benefit from it in theprogress thus far made in refunding the public debt at low rates ofinterest. An adherence to the wise and just policy of an exact observanceof the public faith will enable the Government rapidly to reduce the burdenof interest on the national debt to an amount exceeding $20,000,000 perannum, and effect an aggregate saving to the United States of more than$300,000,000 before the bonds can be fully paid.In adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in theeveryday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal tenderto be assigned to it, a consideration of the first importance should be soto adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold coinage, which nowconstitutes our specie currency, as to accomplish the desired end ofmaintaining the circulation of the two metallic currencies and keeping upthe volume of the two precious metals as our intrinsic money. It is a mixedquestion, for scientific reasoning and historical experience to determine,how far and by what methods a practical equilibrium can be maintained whichwill keep both metals in circulation in their appropriate spheres of commonuse.An absolute equality of commercial value, free from disturbingfluctuations, is hardly attainable, and without it an unlimited legaltender for private transactions assigned to both metals would irresistiblytend to drive out of circulation the clearer coinage and disappoint theprincipal object proposed by the legislation in view. I apprehend,therefore, that the two conditions of a near approach to equality ofcommercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the samedenomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the silvercoinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining both incirculation. If these conditions can be successfully observed, the issuefrom the mint of silver dollars would afford material assistance to thecommunity in the transition to redeemable paper money, and would facilitatethe resumption of specie payment and its permanent establishment. Withoutthese conditions I fear that only mischief and misfortune would flow from acoinage of silver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender, evenin private transactions.Any expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to passas a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value is, I ampersuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that there is any substantialdistinction between an original issue of silver dollars at a nominal valuematerially above their commercial value and the restoration of the silverdollar at a rate which once was, but has ceased to be, its commercialvalue. Certainly the issue of our gold coinage, reduced in weightmaterially below its legal tender value, would not be any the less apresent debasement of the coinage by reason of its equaling, or evenexceeding, in weight a gold coinage which at some past time had beencommercially equal to the legal tender value assigned to the new issue.In recommending that the regulation of any silver coinage which may beauthorized by Congress should observe these conditions of commercial valueand limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling that every possibleincrease should be given to the volume of metallic money which can be keptin circulation, and thereby every possible aid afforded to the people inthe process of resuming specie payments. It is because of my firmconviction that a disregard of these conditions would frustrate the goodresults which are desired from the proposed coinage, and embarrass with newelements of confusion and uncertainty the business of the country, that Iurge upon your attention these considerations.I respectfully recommend to Congress that in any legislation providing fora silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender there beimpressed upon the measure a firm provision exempting the public debtheretofore issued and now outstanding from payment, either of principal orinterest, in any coinage of less commercial value than the present goldcoinage of the country.The organization of the civil service of the country has for a number ofyears attracted more and more of the public attention. So general hasbecome the opinion that the methods of admission to it and the conditionsof remaining in it are unsound that both the great political parties haveagreed in the most explicit declarations of the necessity of reform and inthe most emphatic demands for it. I have fully believed these declarationsand demands to be the expression of a sincere conviction of the intelligentmasses of the people upon the subject, and that they should be recognizedand followed by earnest and prompt action on the part of the legislativeand executive departments of the Government, in pursuance of the purposeindicated.Before my accession to office I endeavored to have my own views distinctlyunderstood, and upon my inauguration my accord with the public opinion wasstated in terms believed to be plain and unambiguous. My experience in theexecutive duties has strongly confirmed the belief in the great advantagethe country would find in observing strictly the plan of the Constitution,which imposes upon the Executive the sole duty and responsibility of theselection of those Federal officers who by law are appointed, not elected,and which in like manner assigns to the Senate the complete right to adviseand consent to or to reject the nominations so made, whilst the House ofRepresentatives stands as the public censor of the performance of officialduties, with the prerogative of investigation and prosecution in all casesof dereliction. The blemishes and imperfections in the civil service may,as I think, be traced in most cases to a practical confusion of the dutiesassigned to the several Departments of the Government. My purpose in thisrespect has been to return to the system established by the fundamentallaw, and to do this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordialunderstanding with the Senate and House of Representatives.The practical difficulties in the selection of numerous officers for postsof widely varying responsibilities and duties are acknowledged to be verygreat. No system can be expected to secure absolute freedom from mistakes,and the beginning of any attempted change of custom is quite likely to bemore embarrassed in this respect than any subsequent period. It is herethat the Constitution seems to me to prove its claim to the great wisdomaccorded to it. It gives to the Executive the assistance of the knowledgeand experience of the Senate, which, when acting upon nominations as towhich they may be disinterested and impartial judges, secures as strong aguaranty of freedom from errors of importance as is perhaps possible inhuman affairs.In addition to this, I recognize the public advantage of making allnominations, as nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense of being freefrom mere caprice or favor in the selection; and in those offices in whichspecial training is of greatly increased value I believe such a rule as tothe tenure of office should obtain as may induce men of properqualifications to apply themselves industriously to the task of becomingproficients. Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavored to reduce thenumber of changes in subordinate places usually made upon the change of thegeneral administration, and shall most heartily cooperate with Congress inthe better systematizing of such methods and rules of admission to thepublic service and of promotion within it as, may promise to be mostsuccessful in making thorough competency, efficiency, and character thedecisive tests in these matters.I ask the renewed attention of Congress to what has already been done bythe Civil Service Commission, appointed, in pursuance of an act ofCongress, by my predecessor, to prepare and revise civil service rules. Inregard to much of the departmental service, especially at Washington, itmay be difficult to organize a better system than that which has thus beenprovided, and it is now being used to a considerable extent under mydirection. The Commission has still a legal existence, although for severalyears no appropriation has been made for defraying its expenses. Believingthat this Commission has rendered valuable service and will be a mostuseful agency in improving the administration of the civil service, Irespectfully recommend that a suitable appropriation, to be immediatelyavailable, be made to enable it to continue its labors.It is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a reportby the chairman of the Commission, and to ask your attention to suchmeasures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote theimprovement of the civil service.During the past year the United States have continued to maintain peacefulrelations with foreign powers.The outbreak of war between Russia and Turkey, though at one time attendedby grave apprehension as to its effect upon other European nations, has hadno tendency to disturb the amicable relations existing between the UnitedStates and each of the two contending powers. An attitude of just andimpartial neutrality has been preserved, and I am gratified to state thatin the midst of their hostilities both the Russian and the TurkishGovernments have shown an earnest disposition to adhere to the obligationsof all treaties with the United States and to give due regard to the rightsof American citizens.By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, immunities, and privilegesof consuls, between Italy and the United States, ratified in 1868, eitherGovernment may, after the lapse of ten years, terminate the existence ofthe treaty by giving twelve months\' notice of its intention. The Governmentof Italy, availing itself of this faculty, has now given the requirednotice, and the treaty will accordingly end on the 17th of September, 1878.It is understood, however, that the Italian Government wishes to renew itin its general scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of itsarticles. In this disposition I concur, and shall hope that no seriousobstacles may intervene to prevent or delay the negotiation of asatisfactory treaty.Numerous questions in regard to passports, naturalization, and exemptionfrom military service have continued to arise in cases of emigrants fromGermany who have returned to their native country. The provisions of thetreaty of February 22, 1868, however, have proved to be so ample and sojudicious that the legation of the United States at Berlin has been able toadjust all claims arising under it, not only without detriment to theamicable relations existing between the two Governments, but, it isbelieved, without injury or injustice to any duly naturalized Americancitizen. It is desirable that the treaty originally made with the NorthGerman Union in 1868 should now be extended so as to apply equally to allthe States of the Empire of Germany.The invitation of the Government of France to participate in the Expositionof the Products of Agriculture, Industry, and the Fine Arts to be held atParis during the coming year was submitted for your consideration at theextra session. It is not doubted that its acceptance by the United States,and a well selected exhibition of the products of American industry on thatoccasion, will tend to stimulate international commerce and emigration, aswell as to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries.A question arose some time since as to the proper meaning of theextradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United States andGreat Britain. Both Governments, however, are now in accord in the beliefthat the question is not one that should be allowed to frustrate the endsof justice or to disturb the friendship between the two nations. No seriousdifficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition of criminals whennecessary. It is probable that all points of disagreement will in due timebe settled, and, if need be, more explicit declarations be made in a newtreaty.The Fishery Commission under Articles XVIII to XXV of the treaty ofWashington has concluded its session at Halifax. The result of thedeliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners, willbe communicated to Congress.A treaty for the protection of trade marks has been negotiated with GreatBritain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its consideration.The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by theaccession of the successful party to power and the installation of itschief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office. It has been thecustom of the United States, when such changes of government haveheretofore occurred in Mexico, to recognize and enter into officialrelations with the de facto government as soon as it should appear to havethe approval of the Mexican people and should manifest a disposition toadhere to the obligations of treaties and international friendship. In thepresent case such official recognition has been deferred by the occurrenceson the Rio Grande border, the records of which have been alreadycommunicated to each House of Congress in answer to their respectiveresolutions of inquiry. Assurances have been received that the authoritiesat the seat of the Mexican Government have both the disposition and thepower to prevent and punish such unlawful invasions and depredations. It isearnestly to be hoped that events may prove these assurances to be wellrounded. The best interests of both countries require the maintenance ofpeace upon the border and the development of commerce between the twoRepublics.It is gratifying to add that this temporary interruption of officialrelations has not prevented due attention by the representatives of theUnited States in Mexico to the protection of American citizens, so far aspracticable; nor has it interfered with the prompt payment of the amountsdue from Mexico to the United States under the treaty of July 4, 1868, andthe awards of the joint commission. While I do not anticipate aninterruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I can not but look withsome solicitude upon a continuance of border disorders as exposing the twocountries to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of action whichare naturally unfavorable to complete amity. Firmly determined that nothingshall be wanting on my part to promote a good understanding between the twonations, I yet must ask the attention of Congress to the actual occurrenceson the border, that the lives and property of our citizens may beadequately protected and peace preserved.Another year has passed without bringing to a close the protracted contestbetween the Spanish Government and the insurrection in the island of Cuba.While the United States have sedulously abstained from any intervention inthis contest, it is impossible not to feel that it is attended withincidents affecting the rights and interests of American citizens. Apartfrom the effect of the hostilities upon trade between the United States andCuba, their progress is inevitably accompanied by complaints, having moreor less foundation, of searches, arrests, embargoes, and oppressive taxesupon the property of American residents, and of unprovoked interferencewith American vessels and commerce. It is due to the Government of Spain tosay that during the past year it has promptly disavowed and offeredreparation for any unauthorized acts of unduly zealous subordinateswhenever such acts have been brought to its attention. Nevertheless, suchoccurrences can not but tend to excite feelings of annoyance, suspicion,and resentment, which are greatly to be deprecated, between the respectivesubjects and citizens of two friendly powers.Much delay (consequent upon accusations of fraud in some of the awards) hasoccurred in respect to the distribution of the limited amounts receivedfrom Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866, applicable to the awardsof the joint commission created by that treaty. So long as these mattersare pending in Congress the Executive can not assume either to pass uponthe questions presented or to distribute the fund received. It is eminentlydesirable that definite legislative action should be taken, eitheraffirming the awards to be final or providing some method for reexaminationof the claims. Our relations with the Republics of Central and SouthAmerica and with the Empire of Brazil have continued without seriouschange, further than the temporary interruption of diplomatic intercoursewith Venezuela and with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already beenfully restored with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that all grounds ofmisunderstanding with Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all thesecountries there are favorable indications of a disposition on the part oftheir Governments and people to reciprocate our efforts in the direction ofincreased commercial intercourse.The Government of the Samoan Islands has sent an envoy, in the person ofits secretary of state, to invite the Government of the United States torecognize and protect their independence, to establish commercial relationswith their people, and to assist them in their steps toward regulated andresponsible government. The inhabitants of these islands, having madeconsiderable progress in Christian civilization and the development oftrade, are doubtful of their ability to maintain peace and independencewithout the aid of some stronger power. The subject is deemed worthy ofrespectful attention, and the claims upon our assistance by this distantcommunity will be carefully considered.The long commercial depression in the United States has directed attentionto the subject of the possible increase of our foreign trade and themethods for its development, not only with Europe, but with othercountries, and especially with the States and sovereignties of the WesternHemisphere. Instructions from the Department of State were issued to thevarious diplomatic and consular officers of the Government, asking them todevote attention to the question of methods by which trade between therespective countries of their official residence and the United Statescould be most judiciously fostered. In obedience to these instructions,examinations and reports upon this subject have been made by many of theseofficers and transmitted to the Department, and the same are submitted tothe consideration of Congress.The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the state of thefinances presents important questions for the action of Congress, upon someof which I have already remarked.The revenues of the Government during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,were $269,000,586.62; the total expenditures for the same period were$238,660,008.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69. This hassubstantially supplied the requirements of the sinking fund for that year.The estimated revenues of the current fiscal year are $265,500,000, and theestimated expenditures for the same period are $232,430,643.72. If theseestimates prove to be correct, there will be a surplus revenue of$33,069,356.28 an amount nearly sufficient for the sinking fund for thatyear. The estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are $269,250,000. Itappears from the report that during the last fiscal year the revenues ofthe Government, compared with the previous year, have largely decreased.This decrease, amounting to the sum of $18,481,452.54, was mainly incustoms duties, caused partly by a large falling off of the amount ofimported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall of prices in themarkets of production of such articles as pay ad valorem taxes.While this is felt injuriously in the diminution of the revenue, it hasbeen accompanied with a very large increase of exportations. The totalexports during the last fiscal year, including coin, have been$658,637,457, and the imports have been $492,097,540, leaving a balance oftrade in favor of the United States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches of business.The estimated revenue for the next fiscal year will impose upon Congressthe duty of strictly limiting appropriations, including the requisite sumfor the maintenance of the sinking fund, within the aggregate estimatedreceipts.While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased, amendments might bemade to the revenue laws that would, without diminishing the revenue,relieve the people from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea and coffee isshown by the experience not only of our own country, but of othercountries, to be easily collected, without loss by undervaluation or fraud,and largely borne in the country of production. A tax of 10 cents a poundon tea and 2 cents a pound on coffee would produce a revenue exceeding$12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to repeal a multitude of annoyingtaxes yielding a revenue not exceeding that sum. The internal revenuesystem grew out of the necessities of the war, and most of the legislationimposing taxes upon domestic products under this system has been repealed.By the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internaltaxation may be repealed, except that on whisky, spirits, tobacco, andbeer. Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting more vigorouslaws for the protection of the revenue and for the punishment of frauds andsmuggling. This can best be done by judicious provisions that will inducethe disclosure of attempted fraud by undervaluation and smuggling. Allrevenue laws should be simple in their provisions and easily understood. Sofar as practicable, the rates of taxation should be in the form of specificduties, and not ad valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced men toascertain values and exposing the revenue to the temptation of fraud.My attention has been called during the recess of Congress to abusesexisting in the collection of the customs, and strenuous efforts have beenmade for their correction by Executive orders. The recommendationssubmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury by a commission appointed toexamine into the collection of customs duties at the port of New Yorkcontain many suggestions for the modification of the customs laws, to whichthe attention of Congress is invited.It is matter of congratulation that notwithstanding the severe burdenscaused by the war the public faith with all creditors has been preserved,and that as the result of this policy the public credit has continuouslyadvanced and our public securities are regarded with the highest favor inthe markets of the world. I trust that no act of the Government will cast ashadow upon its credit.The progress of refunding the public debt has been rapid and satisfactory.Under the contract existing when I entered upon the discharge of the dutiesof my office, bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent werebeing rapidly sold, and within three months the aggregate sales of thesebonds had reached the sum of $200,000,000. With my sanction the Secretaryof the Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of 4 per centbonds, and within thirty days after the popular subscription for such bondswas opened subscriptions were had amounting to $75,496,550, which were paidfor within ninety days after the date of subscription. By this process,within but little more than one year, the annual interest on the publicdebt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.I recommended that suitable provision be made to enable the people toeasily convert their savings into Government securities, as the best modein which small savings may be well secured and yield a moderate interest.It is an object of public policy to retain among our own people thesecurities of the United States. In this way our country is guarded againsttheir sudden return from foreign countries, caused by war or otherdisturbances beyond our limits.The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, and especially theexport of domestic productions, has of late years largely increased; butthe greater portion of this trade is conducted in foreign vessels. Theimportance of enlarging our foreign trade, and especially by direct andspeedy interchange with countries on this continent, can not beoverestimated; and it is a matter of great moment that our own shippinginterest should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the benefit of ourcommerce with other lands. These considerations are forcibly urged by allthe large commercial cities of the country, and public attention isgenerally and wisely attracted to the solution of the problems theypresent. It is not doubted that Congress will take them up in the broadestspirit of liberality and respond to the public demand by practicallegislation upon this important subject.The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been activelyemployed during the year, and has rendered very important service insuppressing hostilities in the Indian country and in preserving peace andprotecting life and property in the interior as well as along the Mexicanborder. A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted, with finalcomplete success, against a portion of the Nez Perce tribe of Indians. Afull account of this campaign will be found in the report of the General ofthe Army. It will be seen that in its course several severe battles werefought, in which a number of gallant officers and men lost their lives. Ijoin with the Secretary of War and the General of the Army in awarding tothe officers and men employed in the long and toilsome pursuit and in thefinal capture of these Indians the honor and praise which are so justlytheir due.The very serious riots which occurred in several of the States in July lastrendered necessary the employment of a considerable portion of the Army topreserve the peace and maintain order. In the States of West Virginia,Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois these disturbances were so formidableas to defy the local and State authorities, and the National Executive wascalled upon, in the mode provided by the Constitution and laws, to furnishmilitary aid. I am gratified to be able to state that the troops sent inresponse to these calls for aid in the suppression of domestic violencewere able, by the influence of their presence in the disturbed regions, topreserve the peace and restore order without the use of force. In thedischarge of this delicate and important duty both officers and men actedwith great prudence and courage, and for their services deserve the thanksof the country.Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to which I have alreadyreferred, have rendered necessary the constant employment of a militaryforce in that vicinity. A full report of all recent military operations inthat quarter has been transmitted to the House of Representatives in answerto a resolution of that body, and it will therefore not be necessary toenter into details. I regret to say that these lawless incursions into ourterritory by armed bands from the Mexican side of the line, for the purposeof robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in spite of the mostvigilant efforts of the commander of our forces the marauders havegenerally succeeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder. In May lastI gave orders for the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of ourtroops for the suppression of these raids and the punishment of the guiltyparties, as well as the recapture of property stolen by them. General Ord,commanding in Texas, was directed to invite the cooperation of the Mexicanauthorities in efforts to this end, and to assure them that I was anxiousto avoid giving the least offense to Mexico. At the same time, he wasdirected to give notice of my determination to put an end to the invasionof our territory by lawless bands intent upon the plunder of our peacefulcitizens, even if the effectual punishment of the outlaws should make thecrossing of the border by our troops in their pursuit necessary. It isbelieved that this policy has had the effect to check somewhat thesedepredations, and that with a considerable increase of our force upon thatfrontier and the establishment of several additional military posts alongthe Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that extensive border,peace may be preserved and the lives and property of our citizens in Texasfully protected.Prior to the 1st day of July last the Army was, in accordance with law,reduced to the maximum of 25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2,500below the force previously authorized. This reduction was made, as requiredby law, entirely from the infantry and artillery branches of the service,without any reduction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now stands it isnecessary that the cavalry regiments be recruited to 100 men in eachcompany for service on the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessaryeffect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and artillery arms ofthe service below the number required for efficiency, and I concur with theSecretary of War in recommending that authority be given to recruit allcompanies of infantry to at least 50 men and all batteries of artillery toat least 75 men, with the power, in case of emergency, to increase theformer to 100 and the latter to 122 men each.I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of theSecretary of War:First. That provision be made for supplying to the Army a more abundant andbetter supply of reading matter.Second. That early action be taken by Congress looking to a completerevision and republication of the Army Regulations.Third. That section 1258 of the Revised Statutes, limiting the number ofofficers on the retired list, be repealed.Fourth. That the claims arising under the act of July 4, 1864, for suppliestaken by the Army during the war, be taken from the offices of theQuartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the SouthernClaims Commission, or some other tribunal having more time and betterfacilities for their prompt investigation and decision than are possessedby these officers.Fifth. That Congress provide for an annuity fund for the families ofdeceased soldiers, as recommended by the paymaster General of the Army.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that we have six squadronsnow engaged in the protection of our foreign commerce and other dutiespertaining to the naval service. The condition and operations of theDepartment are also shown. The total expenditures for the fiscal yearending June 30, 1877, were $16,077,974.54. There are unpaid claims againstthe Department chargeable to the last year, which are presented to theconsideration of Congress by the report of the Secretary. The estimates forthe fiscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are $16,233,234.40, exclusive ofthe sum of $2,314,231 submitted for new buildings, repairs, andimprovements at the several navy yards. The appropriations for the presentfiscal year, commencing July 1, 1877, are $13,592,932.90. The amount drawnfrom the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $5,343,037.40, ofwhich there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,528.30, showing theamount of actual expenditure during the first four months of the presentfiscal year to have been $4,313,509.10.The report of the Postmaster General contains a full and clear statement ofthe operations and condition of the Post Office Department. The ordinaryrevenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,including receipts from the money order business and from official stampsand stamped envelopes, amounted to the sum of $27,531,585.26. Theadditional sum of $7,013,000 was realized from appropriations from thegeneral Treasury for various purposes, making the receipts from all sources$34,544,885.26. The total expenditures during the fiscal year amounted to$33,486,322.44, leaving an excess of total receipts over total expendituresof $1,058,562.82, and an excess of total expenditures over ordinaryreceipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total receipts the sum of$63,261.84, received from international money orders of the precedingfiscal year, and deducting from the total expenditures the sum of$1,163,818.20, paid on liabilities incurred in previous fiscal years, theexpenditures and receipts appertaining to the business of the last fiscalyear were as follows:Expenditures   $32,322,504.24Receipts (ordinary, from money order business andfrom official postage stamps)   27,468,323,420  
Rutherford B. Hayes
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Our heartfelt gratitude is due to the Divine Being who holds in His handsthe destinies of nations for the continued bestowal during the last year ofcountless blessings upon our country.We are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit has greatlyimproved, and is perhaps now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvestshave rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our manufacturingindustries are reviving, and it is believed that general prosperity, whichhas been so long anxiously looked for, is at last within our reach.The enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, beeninterrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence(the yellow fever) in some portions of the Southern States, creating anemergency which called for prompt and extraordinary measures of relief. Thedisease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on theLower Mississippi soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugitivesfrom the infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early inNovember. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have sufferedseverely. About 100,000 cases are believed to have occurred, of which about20,000, according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossibleto estimate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the countryoccasioned by this epidemic It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions ofdollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepestsympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened fromevery quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntarycontributions of money and supplies, in every needed form, were speedilyand generously furnished. The Government was able to respond in somemeasure to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines, and food forthe sick and destitute, the requisite directions for the purpose beinggiven in the confident expectation that this action of the Executive wouldreceive the sanction of Congress. About 1,800 tents, and rations of thevalue of about $25,000, were sent to cities and towns which applied forthem, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the properDepartment.The fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general publicsentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which shall notonly control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision of internalcommerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the Stateand municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whateverendangers the public health, and which the municipal and State authoritiesare unable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April 29,1878, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to providethe means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season,is a step in the direction here indicated. In view of the necessity for themost effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection ofour seaports and the country generally from this and other epidemics, it isrecommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and carefulconsideration.The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of allcitizens in every civil and political right continues to be of paramountinterest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction iswelcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uniformprogress to the desired consummation awakens general uneasiness andwidespread condemnation. The recent Congressional elections have furnisheda direct and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practicalestablishment of the right of suffrage secured by the Constitution to theliberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, real orimaginary, had been removed from all of these States.The three constitutional amendments which conferred freedom and equality ofcivil and political rights upon the colored people of the South wereadopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens whomaintained the authority of the National Government and the integrity andperpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise andnecessary embodiment in the organic law of the just results of the war. Thepeople of the former slaveholding States accepted these results, and gavein every practicable form assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth, andfifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, should in goodfaith be enforced, rigidly and impartially, in letter and spirit, to theend that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, shouldunder them receive full and equal protection in person and property and inpolitical rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments thesouthern section of the Union obtained a large increase of political powerin Congress and in the electoral college, and the country justly expectedthat elections would proceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the samecircumstances of legal and constitutional freedom and protection whichobtained in all the other States of the Union. The friends of law and orderlooked forward to the conduct of these elections as offering to the generaljudgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree inwhich the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored people andwould be respected by their fellow citizens; but a more general enjoymentof freedom of suffrage by the colored people and a more just and generousprotection of that freedom by the communities of which they form a partwere generally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. Insome of those States in which the colored people have been unable to maketheir opinions felt in the elections the result is mainly due to influencesnot easily measured or remedied by legal protection; but in the States ofLouisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular Congressionaldistricts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem tocompel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have beenoverridden and their participation in the elections not permitted to beeither general or free.It will be for the Congress for which these elections were held to makesuch examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to determine thevalidity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile itbecomes the duty of the executive and judicial departments of theGovernment, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations ofthe laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what Isaid in this connection in my last message, that whatever authority restswith me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth; and I am unwillingto forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts, the executiveauthorities, and the people of the States where these wrongs have beenperpetrated to give their assistance toward bringing to justice theoffenders and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within mypower will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the allegedcrimes and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty.It is to be observed that the principal appropriation made for theDepartment of Justice at the last session contained the following clause:And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement ofthe act approved February 28, 1871, entitled "An act to amend an actapproved May 31, 1870, entitled \'An act to enforce the rights of citizensof the United States to vote in the several States of this Union, and forother purposes,\'" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.It is the opinion of the Attorney General that the expenses of theseproceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and Irely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations to enablethe executive department to enforce the laws.I respectfully urge upon your attention that the Congressional elections,in every district, in a very important sense, are justly a matter ofpolitical interest and concern throughout the whole country. Each State,every political party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferredby the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every citizenpossessing the qualifications prescribed by law to east one unintimidatedballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise ofthis power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal,practically as well as formally, submission to the results of the suffragewill be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments ofGovernment will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. Notemporary or administrative interests of Government, however urgent orweighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of theprimary rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection ofliberty requires the maintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of freespeech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the full authorityof Government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve theseinestimable rights. The material progress and welfare of the States dependon the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace withoutsuch protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country isdeeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts.While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling andreciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so seriouslyestranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in thatdirection, and with increasing force. The power of public opinion willoverride all political prejudices and all sectional or State attachments indemanding that all over our wide territory the name and character ofcitizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and carrywith them unchallenged security and respect.Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality incontests between foreign powers has been maintained and respected.The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has beenattended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for thepreparation and arrangement of the contributions of our citizens to thisgreat exposition was well employed in energetic and judicious efforts toovercome this disadvantage. These efforts, led and directed by thecommissioner general, were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of theproducts of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope andcharacter. The reports of the United States commissioners, giving itsresults in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in thisinternational competition for the favor and the trade of the world may beexpected to produce useful and important results in promoting intercourse,friendship, and commerce with other nations.In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878, threecommissioners were appointed to an international conference on the subjectof adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose ofestablishing internationally the use of bimetallic money and securingfixity of relative value between those metals.Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had expressed awillingness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held itsmeetings in Paris in August last. The report of the commissioners, herewithsubmitted, will show its results. No common ratio between gold and silvercould be agreed upon by the conference. The general conclusion was reachedthat it is necessary to maintain in the world the monetary functions ofsilver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or theother of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each state.Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 topay the award of the joint commission at Halifax, if, after correspondencewith the British Government on the subject of the conformity of the awardto the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question therebysubmitted to the commission, the President shall deem it his duty to makethe payment, communications upon these points were addressed to the BritishGovernment through the legation of the United States at London. Failing toobtain the concurrence of the British Government in the views of thisGovernment respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sumnamed within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of thegrounds of the payment and a protest against any other construction of thesame. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you.The Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of theinsurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that island.Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity,which it is earnestly hoped may prove well rounded. Numerous claims ofAmerican citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of property havebeen among the incidents of the long continued hostilities. Some of theseclaims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promisedearly and careful consideration.The treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges hasbeen duly ratified and proclaimed.No questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the Europeanpowers.The Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of such parts ofits treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and it isunderstood has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to opennegotiations with that view. The United States Government has been inclinedto regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japanare found injurious to that people can not but affect injuriously nationsholding commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period ofseclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides in the path ofenlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward tothe time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall beassimilated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking tothis end has been made, which will be submitted for the consideration ofthe Senate.After an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again sentenvoys to the United States. They have been received, and a permanentlegation is now established here by that Government. It is not doubted thatthis step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendlyrelations and removing causes of difference.The treaty with the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified and acceptedon the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey andsoundings of the harbor of Pago Pago have been made by a naval vessel ofthe United States, with a view of its occupation as a naval station iffound desirable to the service.Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico correspondence hasbeen opened and still continues between the two Governments upon thevarious questions which at one time seemed to endanger their relations.While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on theborder, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effectiveforce of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithfulcompliance with instructions, has done much to remove the sources ofdispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops onthe other side of the river is also making an energetic movement againstthe marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks with the greatestsatisfaction upon every evidence of strength in the national authority ofMexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursionsupon our territory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in thecontrol of these incursions by military movements across the border notimperatively demanded for the protection of the lives and property of ourown citizens, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with theproper discharge of this plain duty to recognize the ability of the MexicanGovernment to restrain effectively violations of our territory. It isproposed to hold next year an international exhibition in Mexico, and it isbelieved that the display of the agricultural and manufacturing products ofthe two nations will tend to better understanding and increased commercialintercourse between their people.With Brazil and the Republics of Central and South America some steps havebeen taken toward the development of closer commercial intercourse.Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia and with Bolivia. Aboundary question between the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has beensubmitted by those Governments for arbitration to the President of theUnited States, and I have, after careful examination, given a decision uponit.A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has brought backinformation valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A likeexpedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean. Thereports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to the developmentof our foreign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved ofpublic interest and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise ofour people.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury furnishes a detailed statementof the operations of that Department of the Government and of the conditionof the public finances.The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1878, were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary expenditures for the same periodwere $236,964,326.80, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of$20,799,551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30,1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the firstquarter, commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389,743.43; estimated receipts forthe remaining three quarters of the year, $191,110,256.57; total receiptsfor the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $264,500,000. Theexpenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows:For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures,$73,344,573.27; and for the remaining three quarters of the year theexpenditures are estimated at $166,755,426.73, making the totalexpenditures $240,100,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for theyear ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during thenext fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated according to existinglaws, will be $264,500,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for thesame period will be $236,320,412.68, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32for that year.In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated, noamount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act approvedFebruary 25, 1862, which requires that 1 per cent of the entire debt of theUnited States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be setapart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliancewith the conditions of the law. By its terms the public debt should havebeen reduced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year$518,361,806.28; the actual reduction of the ascertained debt in thatperiod has been $720,644,739.61, being in excess of the reduction requiredby the sinking fund act $202,282,933.33.The amount of the public debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1, 1878,was $2,024,200,083.18 a reduction since the same date last year of$23,150,617.39.The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt atlower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent bondssold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is $100,270,900,and 6 per cent bonds, commonly known as five twenties, to an equal amount,have been or will be redeemed as calls mature.It has been the policy of the Department to place the 4 per cent bondswithin easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings,whether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasuryrecommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, andthat through the post offices or other agents of the Government the freestopportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such investments.The best mode suggested is that the Department be authorized to issuecertificates of deposit, of the denomination of $10, bearing interest atthe rate of 3.65 per cent per annum and convertible at any time within oneyear after their issue into the 4 per cent bonds authorized by therefunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United States notessent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law,supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, withoutcost or risk, to convert his money into an interest bearing security of theUnited States, and the money so received could be applied to the redemptionof 6 per cent bonds.The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $52,798,980. Thecoinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 28, 1878, amountedon the 23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount $4,984,947are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in thepossession of the Government.With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage ofsilver proceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary faithfully toexecute the law and to afford a fair trial to the measure.In the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that thewelfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will bebest promoted by abstaining from all attempts to make radical changes inthe existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during thecoming year the business of the country will be undisturbed by governmentalinterference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect thatthe resumption of specie payments, which will take place at the appointedtime, will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will befollowed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity.Let the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our people, andthe boundless resources of our country have a fair opportunity, and relieffrom present difficulties will surely follow.The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been well andeconomically supplied; that our small force has been actively employed andhas faithfully performed all the service required of it. The morale of theArmy has improved and the number of desertions has materially decreasedduring the year.The Secretary recommends 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H.Benner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while incommand of the steamer. J.M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief ofsufferers in the South from that disease.2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs ofdeceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster General.3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the records ofthe War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that purpose.4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier teachers employed in postschools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings forschools and libraries at the different posts.5. The repeal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the useof the Army "as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the purpose ofexecuting the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances assuch employment of said force may be expressly authorized by theConstitution or by act of Congress."6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues ofrations, tents, and medicines which were made for the relief of sufferersfrom yellow fever.7. That provision be made for the erection of a fireproof building for thepreservation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed todestruction by fire.These recommendations are all commended to your favorable consideration.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the Navy has improvedduring the last fiscal year. Work has been done on seventy five vessels,ten of which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready for sea. Twoothers are in rapid progress toward completion. The total expenditures ofthe year, including the amount appropriated for the deficiencies of theprevious year, were $17,468,392.65. The actual expenses chargeable to theyear, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18less than those of the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than theexpenses including the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal yearending June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.45, exceeding the appropriations ofthe present year only $33,949.75, which excess is occasioned by the demandsof the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the Secretary\'sreport. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14,528,431.70,which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the currentexpenses of the Department during the year. The amount drawn from theTreasury from July 1 to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544.14, of which$70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period$4,669,563.39, or $520,899.24 less than the corresponding period of thelast fiscal year.The report of the Postmaster General embraces a detailed statement of theoperations of the Post Office Department. The expenditures of thatDepartment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $34,165,084.49.The receipts, including sales of stamps, money order business, and officialstamps, were $29,277,516.95. The sum of $290,436.90, included in theforegoing statement of expenditures, is chargeable to preceding years, sothat the actual expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are$33,874,647.59. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, inaddition to the revenues of the Department, was $5,307,652.82. Theexpenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are estimated at$36,571,900 and the receipts from all sources at $30,664,023.90, leaving adeficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. Thereport calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters andof railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that thefailure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposesdoes not relieve the Government of responsibility, but necessarilyincreases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass.In providing for the postal service the following questions are presented:Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely inexcess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established aswill make the Department self sustaining? Should the postal service bereduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way?Should the number of post routes be diminished? Should other methods beadopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of thepostal service?The International Postal Congress which met at Paris May 1, 1878, andcontinued in session until June 4 of the same year, was composed ofdelegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopteda new convention (to take the place of the treaty concluded at BerneOctober 9, 1874), which goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, betweenthe countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratified and approved,by and with the consent of the President, August 13, 1878. A synopsis ofthis Universal Postal Convention will be found in the report of thePostmaster General, and the full text in the appendix thereto. In itsorigin the Postal Union comprised twenty three countries, having apopulation of 350,000,000 people. On the 1st of April next it will compriseforty three countries and colonies, with a population of more than650,000,000 people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remainingcountries and colonies which maintain organized postal services, constitutein fact as well as in name, as its new title indicates, a universal union,regulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postalintercourse between all civilized nations.Some embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs lawsof this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention in regard tothe transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail.It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconcilingthe difficulties which have thus been created, so as to do justice to allparties involved.The business of the Supreme Court and of the courts in many of the circuitshas increased to such an extent during the past year that additionallegislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay of justice andpossible oppression to suitors which is thus occasioned. The encumberedcondition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of theAttorney General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged forCongressional action. The creation of additional circuit judges, asproposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense, atthe present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year.The annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissionerof Indian Affairs present an elaborate account of the present condition ofthe Indian tribes and of that branch of the public service which ministersto their interests. While the conduct of the Indians generally has beenorderly and their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceable,two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in theircharacter, but remained, happily, confined to a comparatively small numberof Indians. The discontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some actsof violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to theoutbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on thereservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy ofthe appropriations made by Congress to the wants of the Indians at a timewhen the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting.After an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United States, and severalengagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjection, and the largerpart of them surrendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection Idesire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of theInterior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of theExecutive, to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion, in suddenemergencies of the Indian service.The other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cheyennes, whosuddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidlythrough the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their oldhunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. Fromdocuments accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior itappears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with thenecessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on thereservation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a restless andmischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole ofthis band have surrendered to the military authorities; and it is agratifying fact that when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of theRed Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Siouxheld them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of theUnited States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarmingrumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown eversince the wishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had beencomplied with.Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite in therecommendation that provision be made by Congress for the organization of acorps of mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be under the control of the Armyand to be used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reservationsand preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concurin this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a bodyof Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, wouldconsiderably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawingfrom it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment underthe Government, it being a matter of experience that Indians in our servicealmost without exception are faithful in the performance of the dutiesassigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the Army in theaccomplishment of a task for which its numerical strength is sometimesfound insufficient.But while the employment of force for the prevention or repression ofIndian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should bemade to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizingagencies for the ultimate solution of what is called the Indian problem. Itmay be very difficult and require much patient effort to curb the unrulyspirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized life, butexperience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which arenow quiet and orderly and self supporting were once as savage as any thatat present roam over the plains or in the mountains of the far West, andwere then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may beimpossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population ofthe United States; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines ofthe country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grownrich, powerful, and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help themin attaining at least that degree of civilization which they may be able toreach. It is not only our duty, it is also our interest to do so. Indianswho have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest inproperty, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element. Itis also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable andquiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, fromthe expressions of Indians themselves and from many concurring reports,that there is a steadily increasing desire, even among Indians belonging tocomparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I inviteattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and theCommissioner of Indian Affairs touching the experiment recentlyinaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children, boys and girls, fromdifferent tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural Institute in Virginia,where they are to receive an elementary English education and training inagriculture and other useful works, to be returned to their tribes, afterthe completed course, as interpreters, instructors, and examples. It isreported that the officer charged with the selection of those childrenmight have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it beenpossible to make provision for them. I agree with the Secretary of theInterior in saying that "the result of this interesting experiment, iffavorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advancementof civilization among the Indians."The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service shouldbe made was at the last session of Congress referred to a committee forinquiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I ventureto express the hope that in the decision of so important a question theviews expressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision,whatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, suchagitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service, aswell as on the Indians themselves.In the enrollment of the bill making appropriations for sundry civilexpenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided forthe continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As thecommission had completed the work of taking testimony on the manyconflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining therights of claimants, threatened for a time to embarrass the interests, notonly of the Government, but also of a large number of the citizens of HotSprings, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginningcontemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, whichwere apprehended, and at the solicitation of many leading citizens of HotSprings and others interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary ofthe Interior was authorized to request the late commissioners to takecharge of the records of their proceedings and to perform such work ascould properly be done by them under such circumstances to facilitate thefuture adjudication of the claims at an early day and to preserve thestatus of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined.The late commissioners complied with that request, and report that thetestimony in all the cases has been written out, examined, briefed, and soarranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It isrecommended that the requisite authority be given at as early a day in thesession as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the latecommissioners for the expense incurred and the labor performed by themsince the 25th of June last.I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by theSecretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber onthe public lands of the United States. The protection of the publicproperty is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department ofthe Interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient appropriations toenforce the laws in that respect. But this matter appears still moreimportant as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of ourforests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in themountainous districts, where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their trees,will remain so forever. There the injury, once done, can not be repaired. Ifully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that forthis reason legislation touching the public timber in the mountainousStates and Territories of the West should be especially well considered,and that existing laws in which the destruction of the forests is notsufficiently guarded against should be speedily modified. A general lawconcerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgentpublic necessity.From the organization of the Government the importance of encouraging byall possible means the increase of our agricultural productions has beenacknowledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the people as thesurest and readiest means of increasing our substantial and enduringprosperity.The words of Washington are as applicable to day as when, in his eighthannual message, he said: It will not be doubted that, with reference eitherto individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. Inproportion as nations advance in population and other circumstances ofmaturity this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation ofthe soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions forpromoting it grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object canit be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have beenemployed to this end none have been attended with greater success than theestablishment of boards (composed of proper characters) charged withcollecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and smallpecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery andimprovement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to theincrease of improvement, by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, andby drawing to a common center the results everywhere of individual skilland observation and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experienceaccordingly hath shewn that they are very cheap instruments of immensenational benefits. The preponderance of the agricultural over any otherinterest in the United States entitles it to all the consideration claimedfor it by Washington. About one half of the population of the United Statesis engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of theUnited States for the year 1878 is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The exportsof agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report ofthe Bureau of Statistics, were $524,000,000. The great extent of ourcountry, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to producewithin our own borders and by our own labor not only the necessaries, butmost of the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet,notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate, and inter communication,it appears from the statistical statements in the report of theCommissioner of Agriculture that we import annually from foreign lands manymillions of dollars worth of agricultural products which could be raised inour own country.Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which canonly be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes fruitless,which are beyond the means of private individuals and are a just and propercharge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is goodpolicy, especially in times of depression and uncertainty in other businesspursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive,territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage by everyproper and legitimate means the occupation and tillage of the soil. Theefforts of the Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce newagricultural industries, to improve the quality and increase the quantityof our products, to determine the value of old or establish the importanceof new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful and favorableconsideration, and assistance by such appropriations of money andenlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the presentfavorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this importantinterest.The abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting public attention. Anational convention of societies specially interested in the subject hasrecently met at Baltimore, and the facts developed, both in regard tocruelties to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the publichealth, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress and theenactment of more efficient laws for the prevention of these abuses.The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows verygratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests committedto the care of this important office. The report is especially encouragingwith respect to the extension of the advantages of the common school systemin sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege offree schools is not yet attained.To education more than to any other agency we are to look as the resourcefor the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge andappreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I desireto repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in behalf of theenactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the purpose ofsupplementing with national aid the local systems of education in theseveral States.Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing thecapacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be providedwithout further delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts,and illustrative art has grown to such proportions, in connection with thecopyright system of the country, as to demand the prompt and carefulattention of Congress to save it from injury in its present crowded andinsufficient quarters. As this library is national in its character, andmust from the nature of the case increase even more rapidly in the futurethan in the past, it can not be doubted that the people will sanction anywise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness.The appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means toorganize, exhibit, and make available for the public benefit the articlesnow stored away belonging to the National Museum I heartily recommend toyour favorable consideration.The attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of the riverfront of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to thehealth of the residents of the national capital, both temporary andpermanent, that the lowlands in front of the city, now subject to tidaloverflow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition these flatsobstruct the drainage of the city and are a dangerous source of malarialpoison. The reclamation will improve the navigation of the river byrestricting, and consequently deepening, its channel, and is also ofimportance when considered in connection with the extension of the publicground and the enlargement of the park west and south of the WashingtonMonument. The report of the board of survey, heretofore ordered by act ofCongress, on the improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, isrespectfully commended to consideration.The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents adetailed statement of the affairs of the District.The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for localpurposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people of theDistrict greatly exceed those of the General Government. The exhibit ismade in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the defectivepavements and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessity;and in the same connection a plan is presented for the permanent funding ofthe outstanding securities of the District.The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions of the District are allentitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform School needsadditional buildings and teachers. Appropriations which will place all ofthese institutions in a condition to become models of usefulness andbeneficence will be regarded by the country as liberality wisely bestowed.The Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to thediscrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation ofland for the support of the public schools, and ask that the sameliberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various States andTerritories of the United States may be extended to the District ofColumbia.The Commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted upon publicand private interests by the present location of the depots and switchingtracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask for legislationlooking to their removal. The recommendations and suggestions contained inthe report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of Congress.Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization of thegovernment of the District under the recent legislation of Congress for theexpression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation, but thepractical results already attained are so satisfactory that the friends ofthe new government may well urge upon Congress the wisdom of itscontinuance, without essential modification, until by actual experience itsadvantages and defects may be more fully ascertained.
Rutherford B. Hayes
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:The members of the Forty sixth Congress have assembled in their firstregular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation andgrateful acknowledgment to the Giver of All Good for the large and unusualmeasure of national prosperity which we now enjoy.The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs sincemy last annual message to Congress are connected with the financialoperations of the Government, directly affecting the business interests ofthe country. I congratulate Congress on the successful execution of theresumption act. At the time fixed, and in the manner contemplated by law,United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of Januarylast they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all businesstransactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they arereceived and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon theTreasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has beencomparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion inexchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metalsdeposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of UnitedStates notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revivalof business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of thecommercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition withother nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand forour manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance oftrade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July lastto November 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption ofspecie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement ofthe public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per centinterest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay offall of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. Theamount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debtsince March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in smallsums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities ismuch greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt whichmatures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which $500,000,000bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance is in bondsbearing 6 per cent interest. It is believed that this part of the publicdebt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds, and, by thereduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $11,000,000 can beannually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction ofinterest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required,which it is hoped will be provided by Congress during its present session.The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the lastfiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since thepassage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was$45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury andare now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of theGovernment.The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the UnitedStates and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanentsystem for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of theworld leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation onthe general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, willsupply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well beawaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. Iwould, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizingthe Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars uponthe present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar beinguniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it isobviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both arecoined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, itwill, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, andthus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silverwhich shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universallyrecognized money of the world.The retirement from circulation of United States notes with the capacity oflegal tender in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progresstoward a safe and stable currency which should be accepted as the policyand duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. Itis my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money basedwholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extremeemergency, is without warrant in the Constitution and a violation of soundfinancial principles. The issue of United States notes during the latecivil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals wasnot authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminentperil. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protractedperiod of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was notcontemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. Theyanticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliestpracticable period consistent with the attainment of the object for whichthey were provided.The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption ofthe Constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt; andwhen, from necessity in time of war, debts have been created, they havebeen paid off, on the return of peace, as rapidly as possible. With thisview, and for this purpose, it is recommended that the existing laws forthe accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debtwithin a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects orrates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested thatexperience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which willnot enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will addseveral millions of dollars annually to the Treasury.The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent andinfluential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the UnitedStates for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands the attentionof every department of the Government. This Territory has a populationsufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interestsof the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the Territory,require its advance from the Territorial form of government to theresponsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change will not,however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in veryconsiderable number uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by thelaws of all civilized communities throughout the world.The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with greatunanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained untilrecently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiardifficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed amongthe citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of theconstitutional guaranty of religious freedom. This objection is nowremoved. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to bewithin the legislative power of Congress and binding as a rule of actionfor all who reside within the Territories. There is no longer any reasonfor delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly andeffectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, itshould be amended; and in aid of the purpose in view I recommend that morecomprehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well aspunishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to thelaw, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenshipin the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn fromthose who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject.The elections of the past year, though occupied only with State officers,have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attended themall over the country new and decisive evidence of the deep interest whichthe great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward amore general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universalsecurity and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While manytopics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both inthe sphere of national and State authority, I find no reason to qualify theopinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary oradministrative interests of government, however urgent or weighty, willever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights ofcitizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override allpolitical prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments in demandingthat all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of theUnited States shall mean one and the same thing and carry with themunchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligenceand patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, howevermuch they maybe divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unitein compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of theright of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defectsin these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its powerto remedy. I again invoke the cooperation of the executive and legislativeauthorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced thatif the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popularrights no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacificationof the country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity.In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject ofthe reformation of the civil service of the Government, and expressed theintention of transmitting to Congress as early as practicable a report uponthis subject by the chairman of the Civil Service Commission.In view of the facts that during a considerable period the Government ofGreat Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses invarious particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and thatin recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been effectiveand in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to havefuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairmanof the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for thispurpose. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report.The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in GreatBritain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and ofofficial interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that afterlong trials of various kinds of examinations those which are competitiveand open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under thesuperintendence of a single commission, have, with great advantage, beenestablished as conditions of admission to almost every official place inthe subordinate administration of that country and of British India. Thecompletion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in itspreparation and the omission of Congress to make any provision either forthe compensation or the expenses of the Commission, has been postponeduntil the present time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress.While the reform measures of another government are of no authority for us,they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsicwisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commendthem to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerningthe defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, exceptin so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty bothof officers and of the people themselves to cooperate for their removal.The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment tooffice and of office tenure are now generally recognized. In theresolutions of the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in thedebates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, thegravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reformhas been admitted.To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based oncommon right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existenceof great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free state.When the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidenceon the part of the officers they have selected and of the advisers who, inaccordance with our political institutions, should be consulted in thepolicy which it is their duty to carry into effect is indispensable. It iseminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well asillustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties.Very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fillthe subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is totheir superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legalinstructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their bestpublic service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective ofpartisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power andwhatever policy prevails. As a consequence it follows that their tenure ofoffice should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the supremacyof any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve thepeople most usefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The sameconsiderations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in theappointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The authorityof appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid afriend or reward a partisan, but is a trust, to be exercised in the publicinterest under all the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply thepublic funds only for public purposes.Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering thepublic service of his country. The only just ground of discrimination isthe measure of character and capacity he has to make that service mostuseful to the people. Except in cases where, upon just and recognizedprinciples as upon the theory of pensions offices and promotions arebestowed as rewards for past services, their bestowal upon any theory whichdisregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well asa breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held.In the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to providejust and adequate means, especially for every Department and largeadministrative office, where personal discrimination on the part of itshead is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications to whichappointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide suchmeans is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts uponwhich the most righteous claim to office depends, but of necessity todiscourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removalsto mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiestclaimant to gain the appointment and the interest of the people to bestowit upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method ofascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanentfunction of every just and wise government. It has long since becomeimpossible in the great offices for those having the duty of nomination andappointment to personally examine into the individual qualifications ofmore than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with theenlargement of the civil service that proportion must continue to becomeless.In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so fewin number that it was quite easy for those making appointments andpromotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managersand methods had not then become powerful agencies of coercion, hostile tothe free and just exercise of the appointing power.A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service tothe desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President, and it is mypurpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and gradualmeasures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radicalchange of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactoryto a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority it isin the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform. But itcan not be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplishedwithout cooperation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligentsupport among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally acceptedtheories of parties and demand changes in the methods of Departments arenot the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in soundprinciples and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposesthe errors of their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make hisofficial action a gain and an honor to his country; but the peoplethemselves, far more than their officers in public station, are interestedin a pure, economical, and vigorous administration.By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in theRevised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the severalsubordinate grades in the great Departments was condemned, and examinationsas to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examiners, wereprovided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. Thesestatutes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort as toattainments and capacity are essential to the well being of the publicservice. The important questions since the enactment of these laws havebeen as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favorand partisan influence or common right and merit were to control the accessto the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always beenopen to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Officialfavoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designatedthose who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards,subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of thecandidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard ofadmission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was alsoalmost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boardsof examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure,should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests ofcapacity, highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and moreradical change was obviously required.In the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads ofDepartments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous andthankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of findingplaces for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men,and often not even fit men, for public place. The elevation andpurification of the civil service of the Government will be hailed withapproval by the whole people of the United States. Congress accordinglypassed the act approved March 3, 1871, "to regulate the civil service ofthe United States and promote the efficiency thereof," giving the necessaryauthority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil service reform.Acting under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure asystem of just and effectual examinations under uniform supervision, anumber of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, whoentered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with anintelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service the regulationscontemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who in theircapacity as a board have been known as the "Civil Service Commission."Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensationand for the expense of carrying on the work of the Commission.It appears from the report of the Commission submitted to the President inApril, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of thecountry, and that an appropriation of about $25,000 would be required tomeet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging theduties of the Commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by specialmessage of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon thelabors of the Commission: If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt therules can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as tostill more materially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive,members of Congress, and the heads of Departments from influencesprejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto beenenforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of themembers of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the Departments, and inthat opinion I concur. And in the annual message of December of the sameyear similar views are expressed and an appropriation for continuing thework of the Commission again advised.The appropriation was not made, and as a consequence the active work of theCommission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still in existence.Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifications to be tested in anysystematic manner or of securing for the public service the advantages ofcompetition upon any extensive plan, I recommended in my annual message ofDecember, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of thework of the Commission.In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under manyembarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in the ExecutiveDepartments in Washington and in a number of the custom houses andpost offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to furthertest their effects, and in every instance they have been found to be assalutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of mypredecessor. I think the economy, purity, and efficiency of the publicservice would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction,wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of theGovernment, together with ample provision for their general supervision inorder to secure consistency and uniform justice.Reports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster General,from the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations havebeen some time on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the navalofficer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters andcollectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitivesystem, where applied, has in various ways contributed to improve thepublic service.The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree,and that the general application of similar rules can not fail to be ofdecided benefit to the service.The reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York especially,bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations intheir respective offices, showing that These examinations and theexcellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them havehad a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service,and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on thepart of these latter an increased interest in the work and a desire toextend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thusthe morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have beenattended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughlyinvestigate the scope and character of the tests and the method ofdetermining the results, and those visitors have without exception approvedthe methods employed, and several of them have publicly attested theirfavorable opinion. Upon such considerations I deem it my duty to renew therecommendation contained in my annual message of December, 1877, requestingCongress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the workof the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing amoderate compensation to persons in the public service who may performextra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may direct.I am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced foradmission to the public service and in making promotions such abuses asremovals without good cause and partisan and official interference with theproper exercise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear.There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congressshould be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments and theconstant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbingand mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed,which not only interferes with the due discharge of official duty, but isincompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in theviews of several of my predecessors in the Presidential office, anddirectly within the law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulationmade on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to suchabuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, todefine with precision the proper limit of political action on the part ofFederal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express theiropinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neitherbe allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the properdischarge of their official duties nor to use the authority of their officeto enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of thosewho hold different opinions.Reasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbidthe use of official power for the oppression of the private citizen imposeupon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents fromarbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of makinglevies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers is highlydemoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Thoughan officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money inaid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any othercitizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a faircompensation for the time and labor of the officer, it is gross injusticeto levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they maybear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds.I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutesas shall secure to those in every grade of official life or publicemployment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation shouldguard those who are faithful in its service.Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful.With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of thelocal laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincialauthorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty toAmerican fishermen. The United States minister in London has beeninstructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damagesreceived by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January,1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the BritishGovernment, and an early reply is anticipated.Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the subjectof our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty,will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government, with aview to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which wasonly temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington.Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions foundinjurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom.Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and savingof life and property upon the Lakes, which has resulted in importantmodifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion government on thesubject in the interest of humanity and commerce.In accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of Congress,commissioners were appointed to represent the United States at the twointernational exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress atSydney, and the other to be held next year at Melbourne. A desire has beenexpressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the importantand growing trade with Australia that an increased provision should be madeby Congress for the representation of our industries at the Melbourneexhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to yourfavorable consideration.The assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the coast ofMassachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable between France,by way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this country, subject to anyfuture legislation of Congress on the subject. The conditions imposedbefore allowing this connection with our shores to be established are suchas to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of marinecable and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire equalityof rights to our Government and people with those of France in the use ofthe cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege asaccorded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communicationbetween France and the United States which may be projected andaccomplished by our citizens. An important reduction of the present ratesof cable communication with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to theinterests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment ofthis competing line.The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some generalregulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by mypredecessor in his message of December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submitto your consideration the importance of Congressional action in thematter.The questions of grave importance with Spain growing out of the incidentsof the Cuban insurrection have been for the most part happily and honorablysettled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commission now sittingin Washington for the decision of private cases in this connection willsoon be able to bring its labors to a conclusion.The long standing question of East Florida claims has lately been renewedas a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressionalaction for its final disposition.A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to consular rights andprivileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified,and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st of July last. Negotiationsfor extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now inprogress.Some questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrantshave arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a justand satisfactory basis. A question has also occurred with respect to anasserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage overpersons and property of Swiss citizens naturalized in this country. It ispossible this may require adjustment by treaty.With the German Empire frequent questions arise in connection with theSubjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Imperial Governmenthas constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with alltreaty stipulations in regard to them.In consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomaticrepresentative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been withdrawn. Thereis now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two countries,and the expediency of providing for one in some form is submitted toCongress.Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgiumcontinue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial importance.A change of the personal head of the Government of Egypt has taken place.No change, however, has occurred in the relations between Egypt and theUnited States. The action of the Egyptian Government in presenting to thecity of New York one of the ancient obelisks, which possess such historicinterest, is highly appreciated as a generous mark of international regard.If prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across theAtlantic, its erection in a conspicuous position in the chief commercialcity of the nation will soon be accomplished.The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard tothe revision of former commercial treaties it is now believed will befollowed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. Theattention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnityfunds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with theiraccumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any part of thesefunds is justly due to American citizens, they should receive it promptly;and whatever may have been received by this Government in excess ofstrictly just demands should in some form be returned to the nations towhom it equitably belongs.The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider thequestion of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with adispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measures as may tend toprevent injurious consequences to the United States. The negotiations arestill proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew ChewIslands, the United States Government has taken measures to inform thosepowers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the maintenance ofpeace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find it practicable toavail themselves of the proffer.It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judiciousand energetic action of the military commanders of the two nations on eachside of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of their respectiveGovernments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and in thelocalities where formerly most destructive have now almost wholly ceased.In view of this result, I entertain a confident expectation that theprevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justifya modification of the present orders to our military commanders as tocrossing the border, without encouraging such disturbances as wouldendanger the peace of the two countries.The third installment of the award against Mexico under the claimscommission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course ofdistribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same.This satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me toanticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increasedcontribution of capital and industry by our people to the development ofthe great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom ofCongress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result.Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the arrivalof a minister from that country to the United States. This is especiallyfortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter oceanic canalhas recently assumed a new and important aspect and is now under discussionwith the Central American countries through whose territory the canal, bythe Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightenedstatesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such awork will largely inure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens andthose of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. Itis not doubted that should the work be undertaken under the protectiveauspices of the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for theright of way and its security by the Central American Governments, thecapital for its completion would be readily furnished from this country andEurope, which might, failing such guaranties, prove inaccessible.Diplomatic relations with Chile have also been strengthened by thereception of a minister from that country.The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chile still continues. The United Stateshave not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further than to conveyto all the Governments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices ofthe Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon anhonorable basis will be extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit areadiness to accept them.Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, andtrade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and morefrequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the ports of thiscountry and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve theattention of Congress as an essential precursor of an enlargement of ourcommerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade.A recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the establishment ofa provisional government. This government has not yet been formallyrecognized, and it is deemed desirable to await the proposed action of thepeople which is expected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms.A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and takepossession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa in theharbor of Pago Pago. A coaling station is to be established there, whichwill be convenient and useful to United States vessels.The subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and Servia, nowbecome independent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, and isthe subject of diplomatic correspondence.There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European andAmerican countries, and it is believed that with judicious action in regardto its development it can and will be still more enhanced and that Americanproducts and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reportsof diplomatic and consular officers upon this subject, under the system nowadopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which hasbeen and will continue to be laid before Congress and the public from timeto time.The third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1867, by whichAlaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of theceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shallbe admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the UnitedStates and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of theirliberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to suchlaws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt inregard to the aboriginal tribes of that country.Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the peoplerequire that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaskabe adopted.There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged withcommon law offenses, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and nomagistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Seriousdifficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not onlyamong the original inhabitants, but among citizens of the United States andother countries who have engaged in mining, fishing, and other businessoperations within the territory. A bill authorizing the appointment ofjustices of the peace and constables and the arrest and detention ofpersons charged with criminal offenses, and providing for an appeal toUnited States courts for the district of Oregon in suitable cases, will ata proper time be submitted to Congress.The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretaryof the Treasury on the condition of the public finances.The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1879, were $273,827,184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same periodwere $266,947,883.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of$6,879,300.93.The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual andestimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter,commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for theremaining three quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts forthe current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, asfollows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures,$91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three quarters of the year theexpenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the totalexpenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for theyear ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total receipts during thenext fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, estimated according to existinglaws, will be $288,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for thesame period will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 forthat year.The large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and thepresent fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented theapplication of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for thecurrent year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it isbelieved that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without anychange of existing law.The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for thefiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being for aless sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from thatDepartment during a period of at least twelve years.He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation aswill authorize the enlistment of the full number of 25,000 men for the lineof the Army, exclusive of the 3,463 men required for detached duty, andtherefore not available for service in the field.He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for thedisposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reservations,which, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless formilitary purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement.He unites with the Quartermaster General in recommending that anappropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectlyfireproof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts,vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in theQuartermaster General\'s Office, and exposed to great risk of totaldestruction by fire.He also recommends, in conformity with the views of theJudge Advocate General, some declaratory legislation in reference to themilitary statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion. Inthese several recommendations I concur.The Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improvement ofthe South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr. James B.Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted duringthe past year with a greater measure of success in the attainment ofresults than during any previous year. The channel through the South Pass,which at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only 71/2 feet of water, had on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of 26feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of 30feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the workprogressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further paymentswill become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success inmaintaining the channel now secured.The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates present afull and detailed account of the military operations for the suppression ofhostilities among the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise isjustly awarded to the officers and troops engaged for promptness, skill,and courage displayed.The past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on theMexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of thisGovernment and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will provepermanently successful.This Department was enabled during the past year to find temporary, thoughcrowded, accommodations and a safe depository for a portion of its recordsin the completed east wing of the building designed for the State, War, andNavy Departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, apart of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, is beingcarried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receivefrom Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedycompletion.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in thatbranch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs havebeen made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and madeready for sea.The total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including specificappropriations not estimated for by the Department, were $13,555,710.09.The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount of thesespecific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to areduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, butnot paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable tothe last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a balance of$1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of the Department onJune 30, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are$14,864,147.95, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscalyear $361,897.28. The reason for this increase is explained in theSecretary\'s report. The appropriations available for the present fiscalyear are $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary,answer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from theTreasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879 was $5,770,404.12, of which$1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period$4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two thirds of the yeardo not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remainunexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of the currentappropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the gratifying fact thatamong all the disbursing officers of the Pay Corps of the Navy there is notone who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with himin recommending the removal of the observatory to a more healthfullocation. That institution reflects credit upon the nation, and hasobtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Itsremoval from its present location would not only be conducive to the healthof its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness.The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made forthe Department of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last session ofCongress, and no appropriation whatever was made for the payment of thefees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process orfor the discharge of other duties; and since June 30 these officers havecontinued the performance of their duties without compensation from theGovernment, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays, aswell as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instanceshas the proper execution of the process of the United States failed byreason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course ofofficial conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to theirfidelity, was advised by the Attorney General, who informed them, however,that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon theprospect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especiallyrecommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for thispurpose.The act making the principal appropriation for the Department of Justice atprevious sessions has uniformly contained the following clause: And fordefraying the expenses which my be incurred in the enforcement of the actapproved February 28, 1871, entitled "An act to amend an act approved May31, 1870, entitled \'An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the UnitedStates to vote in the several States of this Union, and for otherpurposes,\'" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. Noappropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no generalelection for Members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter oflittle practical importance. Such election will, however, take place duringthe ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of marshals anddeputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services theymay be required to perform at such elections.The business of the Supreme Court is at present largely in arrears. It cannot be expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed of inits annual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrateswho compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courtsof many of the circuits also the business has increased to such an extentthat the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to anappropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit whichcan fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising fromdelay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors,as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involvethe discussion of questions of a public character.The remedy suggested by the Attorney General is the appointment ofadditional circuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court oferrors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of itsjurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance ofcircuit duties.I commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seemto afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional circuitjudges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, ofnot more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparisonwith the objects to be attained.The report of the Postmaster General bears testimony to the general revivalof business throughout the country. The receipts of the Post OfficeDepartment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86,being $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the preceding year. The amountrealized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postalcards was $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23more than in 1877. The expenditures of the Department were $33,449,899.45,of which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred inpreceding years.The expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in thepreceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the operationof the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation of postmastersfrom a commission on the value of stamps sold to a commission on stampscanceled.The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to therevenues of the Department, was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86 lessthan in the preceding year.The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at$39,920,900 and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving adeficiency to be appropriated for out of the Treasury of $7,710,900.The relations of the Department with railroad companies have beenharmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of theircompensation by the appropriation for special facilities, and the railwaypost office lines have been greatly extended, especially in the SouthernStates. The interests of the Railway Mail Service and of the public wouldbe greatly promoted and the expenditures could be more readily controlledby the classification of the employees of the Railway Mail Service asrecommended by the Postmaster General, the appropriation for salaries, withrespect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made ingross.The Postmaster General recommends an amendment of the law regulating theincrease of compensation for increased service and increased speed on starroutes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for such increasedservice and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to thecommerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizingcontracts with American built steamers, carrying the American flag, fortransporting the mail between ports of the United States and ports of theWest Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, theamount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, in likemanner with the amount paid for the domestic star service.The arrangement made by the Postmaster General and the Secretary of theTreasury for the collection of duty upon books received in the mail fromforeign countries has proved so satisfactory in its practical operationthat the recommendation is now made that Congress shall extend theprovisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrangement wasmade, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mailsfrom foreign countries.The reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner ofIndian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with theIndian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance theircivilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them,will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of ourIndian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of twodisturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, isall the more to be lamented.The history of the outbreak on the White River Ute Reservation, in westernColorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public pressthat its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It isexpected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to sucharrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indiansand the border settlements in western Colorado.The other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico,where Victoria, at the head of a small band of marauders, after committingmany atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his wayacross the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil.While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indianswere engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian populationhave fully justified the expectations of those who believe that by humaneand peaceful influences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits ofsavage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.What they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural andmechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experimentof employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among thewildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressedby them for the education of their children may be taken as sufficientproof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if theycontinue to be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy" sketched inthe report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to makeliberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indiansupon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms,inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thusprovided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations notoccupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for thebenefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of theexpenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself asjust and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove thoseobstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to thesettlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommendthe enactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title infee, inalienable for twenty five years, to the farm lands assigned to themby allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first annualmessage, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactoryproof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number ofyears, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribalrelations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patentscontaining the same provision of inalienability for a certain period.The experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to theHampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive anelementary English education and practical instruction in farming and otheruseful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thoughtexpedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania,to the Interior Department for the establishment of an Indian school on alarger scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes,and is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of anumber of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific Slope ina similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions willcommend themselves to the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropicmunificence of the American people.Last spring information was received of the organization of an extensivemovement in the Western States, the object of which was the occupation byunauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by theCherokees to the Government for the purpose of settlement by other Indiantribes.On the 26th of April I issued a proclamation warning all persons againstparticipation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a militaryforce the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect therights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent ofthe executive power; but it would be unwise to ignore the fact that aterritory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with sogreat a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to therepetition of such attempts as happened this year when the surroundingStates are more densely settled and the westward movement of our populationlooks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under suchcircumstances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in itspresent state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting itwould do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fully approveof the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recentoccasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity oftheir lands as they can cultivate; to acquire individual title in feeinstead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider inwhat manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Governmentfor their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainlysecure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same timepromote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoringto perpetuate the present state of things in the Territory.The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service shouldbe made was in the Forty fifth Congress referred to a joint committee ofboth Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressedthe hope that the decision of that question, then in prospect, would"arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt toproduce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indiansthemselves." Since then, the committee having reported, the question hasbeen decided in the negative by a vote in the House of Representatives.For the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that furtheruncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much neededlegislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettlesalutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of theIndians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congressat its last session be permitted to stand.The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest thedepredations on the timber lands of the United States have been continued,and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespasshave been prosecuted in the courts of the United States; others have beensettled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for thevalue of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions andsettlements turned into the Treasury far exceed in amount the sumsappropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result,however, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests bydepredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced inextent, and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursuedand sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses,at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in theTerritories, where timber for the daily requirements of the population cannot, under the present state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I thereforeearnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made bythe Secretary of the Interior, that a law be enacted enabling theGovernment to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee,where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, suchsales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and businessrequirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweepingdestruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to become amore pressing necessity every day.My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging thefacilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the leadinginterest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to the abundanceof agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and thelargely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyedin recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity asa people. We must look for its continued maintenance to the samesubstantial resource. There is no branch of industry in which labor,directed by scientific knowledge, yields such increased production incomparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service towhich the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriatelyextended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy, but, onthe contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually thatmight be saved through well directed efforts by the Government to promotethis vital interest.The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretoforeplaced at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an earnest ofwhat may be expected with increased appropriations for the several purposesindicated in the report of the Commissioner, with a view to placing theDepartment upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute moreeffectively the objects for which it is established.Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for theestablishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and foran increase of force.The requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report ofthe Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of theDepartment, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture.It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to whicheducational privileges throughout the United States have been advancedduring the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congressthan that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education,supplemental to local action in the States and Territories and in theDistrict of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of ourGovernment has not only furnished the basis for the support of thecommon school systems of the newer States, but laid the foundations for themaintenance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and themechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this traditional policy, for thefurther benefit of all these interests and the extension of the sameadvantages to every portion of the country, it is hoped will receive yourfavorable consideration.To preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among theforemost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at theCapitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations for itsrapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the collection,increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright, bydomestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific library of theSmithsonian Institution, call for building accommodations which shall be atonce adequate and fireproof. The location of such a public building, whichshould provide for the pressing necessities of the present and for the vastincrease of the nation\'s books in the future, is a matter which addressesitself to the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as ameasure which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer bedelayed.The joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876, forthe purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the WashingtonNational Monument, of which commission the President is a member, has givencareful attention to this subject, and already the strengthening of thefoundation has so far progressed as to insure the entire success of thispart of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been introduced below theoriginal foundation, widening the base, increasing the stability of thestructure, and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to completion. Itis earnestly recommended that such further appropriations be made for thecontinued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion ofthis national monument at an early day.In former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject, I havetaken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of a generous policytoward the District of Columbia. The report of the Commissioners of theDistrict, herewith transmitted, contains suggestions and recommendations,to all of which I earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask your earlyand favorable consideration of the views which they express as to theurgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of thePotomac and its Eastern Branch within the limits of the city, and for therepair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocksand now by decay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent dangerto the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of theCommissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of theseimportant works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations fromthe Federal Treasury.The filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacentlands and parks now owned by the United States a large and valuable domain,sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and will also, asan incidental result, secure the permanent improvement of the river for thepurposes of navigation.The Constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusivejurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of necessitylook to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting theirinterests; and as the territory of this District is the common property ofthe people of the United States, who equally with its resident citizens areinterested in the prosperity of their capital, I can not doubt that youwill be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measuresyou may adopt for this purpose.I also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of thepublic schools of this District, as exhibited in the report of theCommissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing, noadequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of schoolaccommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet thisurgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school purposes arerented, and are in important particulars unsuited for the purpose. Thecause of popular education in the District of Columbia is surely entitledto the same consideration at the hands of the National Government as in theseveral States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the publiclands have been made for the endowment of schools and universities.
Rutherford B. Hayes
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of ourcountry. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during thepast year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable employmentfor all our people, and with contentment at home, and with peace andfriendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty fourth electionof Chief Magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the people of theUnited States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peacefuland safe transmission of the power and authority of government from thepublic servants whose terms of office are about to expire to their newlychosen successors. This example can not fail to impress profoundlythoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which republicaninstitutions afford. The immediate, general, and cheerful acquiescence ofall good citizens in the result of the election gives gratifying assuranceto our country and to its friends throughout the world that a governmentbased on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesseselements of strength, stability, and permanency not found in any other formof government.Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights ofcitizenship conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments tothe Constitution still prevails in several of the late slaveholding States.It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent election to any largeextent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulentpractices in connection with the ballots, with the regulations as to theplaces and manner of voting, and with counting, returning, and canvassingthe votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the rightpreservative of all rights the right of suffrage which the Constitutionexpressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens.It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalismas a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer that no sectionof the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section.The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rightsamendments to the Constitution is all that now stands in the way of acomplete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As longas either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it issafe to assume that the people who placed them in the Constitution, asembodying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believethem to be wise and necessary, will continue to act together and to insistthat they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to theenjoyment of the fight by every American citizen who has the requisitequalifications to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted.With this question rightly settled, the country will be relieved of thecontentions of the past; bygones will indeed be bygones, and political andparty issues, with respect to economy and efficiency of administration,internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance,and other important subjects, will then receive their full share ofattention; but resistance to and nullification of the results of the warwill unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintainthe authority of the Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and whoadequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determinationproceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people ofour country or to any of their interests. The inviolability of theamendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our Government. They arethe solemn expression of the will of the people of the United States.The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must bemaintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Governmentof the country. Happily, the history of the late election shows that inmany parts of the country where opposition to the fifteenth amendment hasheretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogetherif firm and well considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the Houseof Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of theelections, returns, and qualifications of their own members, will see to itthat every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenthamendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from suchviolation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of theExecutive, with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecuteunsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rightsguaranteed to them by the Constitution.It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaranty ofthe primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity forself protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universalsuffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command ofthe local and State authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate tofurnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true wherebefore emancipation the education of the people was neglected or prevented,in the interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of populareducation deserves the earnest attention of the people of the wholecountry, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government ofthe United States, I respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitablelegislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educationalfunds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities ofcitizenship have been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to thepurpose grants of the public lands and, if necessary, by appropriationsfrom the Treasury of the United States. Whatever Government can fairly doto promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever generaleducation is found, peace, virtue, and social order prevail and civil andreligious liberty are secure.In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to theurgent necessity of a reformation of the civil service system of theGovernment. My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointmentsfor personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by myobservation and experience in the Executive office, and I believe thesedangers threaten the stability of the Government. Abuses so serious intheir nature can not be permanently tolerated. They tend to become morealarming with the enlargement of administrative service, as the growth ofthe country in population increases the number of officers and placemenemployed.The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for theregulation of appointments, promotions, and removals, establishing auniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the attainmentof the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a methodalone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens and the mosteconomical and efficient administration of the public business.Competitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and promotionshave been conducted for some years past in several of the ExecutiveDepartments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in thecustom houses and post offices of the larger cities of the country. In thecity of New York over 2,000 positions in the civil service have beensubject in their appointments and tenure of place to the operation ofpublished rules for this purpose during the past two years. The results ofthese practical trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed myopinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the sametests, and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisaninfluence. It secures for the position applied for the best qualificationsattainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protectionfrom the pressure of importunity, which under any other course pursuedlargely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to theirgreat detriment in the discharge of other official duties preventing theabuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party purposes,and leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the obligationsimposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention andadvancement, and with this constant incentive to exertion and improvement.These invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the officeswhere the rules for appointment by competitive examination have beenapplied.A method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at points wheresuch tests may be fairly considered conclusive should be extended to allsubordinate positions under the Government. I believe that a strong andgrowing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing andenforcing the highest possible efficiency in the civil service and itsprotection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to hasdemonstrated the feasibility of such measures.The examinations in the custom houses and post offices have been held undermany embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extralabor performed by the officers who have conducted them, and whosecommendable interest in the improvement of the public service has inducedthis devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance ofthese labors gratuitously ought not to be expected, and without anappropriation by Congress for compensation it is not practicable to extendthe system of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It isalso highly important that all such examinations should be conducted upon auniform system and under general supervision. Section 1753 of the RevisedStatutes authorizes the President to prescribe the regulations foradmission to the civil service of the United States, and for this purposeto employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries withreference to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health,character, knowledge, and ability for the branch of service into which heseeks to enter;" but the law is practically inoperative for want of therequisite appropriation.I therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet theexpenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in accordancewith the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just,uniform, and efficient system of competitive examinations and to supervisethe application of the same throughout the entire civil service of theGovernment. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission willafford for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not onlybe as welcome a relief to members of Congress as it will be to thePresident and heads of Departments, but that it will also greatly tend toremove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantlyattend the conflicting claims of patronage between the legislative andexecutive departments. The most effectual check upon the perniciouscompetition of influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of officewill be the substitution of an open competition of merit between theapplicants, in which everyone can make his own record with the assurancethat his success will depend upon this alone.I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as freeas any other citizen to express his political opinions and to use his meansfor their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any privatecitizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for political purposes. Alaw which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who areengaged in the public service, and likewise contain stringent provisionsagainst the use of official authority to coerce the political action ofprivate citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desired.The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service,and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, hasbeen found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, bywhich the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by membersof Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be acomplete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter ofappointments. The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors belong thespoils" is inseparable from Congressional patronage as the established ruleand practice of parties in power. It comes to be understood by applicantsfor office and by the people generally that Representatives and Senatorsare entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts andStates. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting fromthis invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of Governmenton the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the nationalconventions of the leading parties of the country, have again and againbeen approved by the American people, and have not been called in questionin any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon thisall important subject are the statement of principles that belong to theconstitutional structure of the Government. Under the Constitution thePresident and heads of Departments are to make nominations for office. TheSenate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House ofRepresentatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The bestinterest of the public service demands that these distinctions berespected; that Senators and Representatives, who may be judges andaccusers, should not dictate appointments to office. To this end thecooperation of the legislative department of the Government is requiredalike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members ofCongress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them withreference to appointments to office until by legislative enactment thepernicious practice is condemned and forbidden.It is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the relations ofmembers of Congress with respect to appointment to office by the President;and I also recommend that the provisions of section 1767 and of thesections following of the Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure of officeact of March 2, 1867, be repealed.Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in ourcountry is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship,and that it can be permanently done only by the cooperation of thelegislative and executive departments of the Government, I again commendthe whole subject to your considerate attention.It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States tosuppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territories and to prevent itsextension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United Statesauthorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shownthat the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensivemodification and amendment. The longer action is delayed the more difficultit will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures arenecessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has thewhole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory.By its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influenceover the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sectdo, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to makeeffective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject ofpolygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not beabolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice anduphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the politicalpower of the sect which encourages and sustains it.The power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories isample. It is not a case for halfway measures. The political power of theMormon sect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and mostpopulous Territories. It is extending steadily into other Territories.Wherever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. Thesanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner stone of ourAmerican society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separation ofchurch and state are among the elementary ideas of free institutions. Toreestablish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism haveimperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants ofall creeds that part of our domain which has been in a great degree closedto general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it isrecommended that the government of the Territory of Utah be reorganized.I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governorand judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed bythe Senate a government analogous to the provisional governmentestablished for the territory northwest of the Ohio by the ordinance of1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of localgovernment, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office, and sit onjuries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practicenor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed thatwithin a few years the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, andthat this Territory will in good time become one of the most prosperous andattractive of the new States of the Union.Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbedpeace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to their continuedmaintenance.My anticipation of an early reply from the British Government to the demandof indemnity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that industry atFortune Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in my last annual message,was disappointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of Aprilin the present year, and when received exhibited a failure of accordbetween the two Governments as to the measure of the inshore fishingprivilege secured to our fishermen by the treaty of Washington of soserious a character that I made it the subject of a communication toCongress, in which I recommended the adoption of the measures which seemedto me proper to be taken by this Government in maintenance of the rightsaccorded to our fishermen under the treaty and toward securing an indemnityfor the injury these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out theserecommendations was under consideration by the House of Representatives atthe time of the adjournment of Congress in June last.Within a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty\'sGovernment renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the indemnityfor the injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty inwhich the previous correspondence had shown the two Governments to be atvariance. Upon both these topics the disposition toward a friendlyagreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity forthe transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity tofurther conference, and by an assent to the view of this Government,presented in the previous correspondence, that the regulation ofconflicting interests of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts andthe vessel fishery of our fishermen should be made the subject ofconference and concurrent arrangement between the two Governments.I sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of thevery serious divergence of views in the interpretation of the fisheryclauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspondence betweenthe two Governments stood at the close of the last session of Congress,seemed to be irreconcilable.In the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last yearat Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress atMelbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorablyrepresented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place receiveda large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, andthe participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark ofdistinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our countryis no less notable, and an equal degree of success is confidentlyexpected.The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations of thecontinent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic andcommercial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a conventionwith the French Republic for the settlement of claims of the citizens ofeither country against the other. Under this convention a commission,presided over by a distinguished publicist, appointed in pursuance of therequest of both nations by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, has beenorganized and has begun its sessions in this city. A congress to considermeans for the protection of industrial property has recently been insession in Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of the UnitedStates in France and in Belgium as delegates. The International Commissionupon Weights and Measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite yourattention to the necessity of an appropriation to be made in time to enablethis Government to comply with its obligations under the metricalconvention.Our friendly relations with the German Empire continue withoutinterruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheriesat Berlin the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the hastewith which the commission was forced to make its preparations, wasextremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitorsnumerous awards of a high class and for the country at large the principalprize of honor offered by His Majesty the Emperor. The results of thisgreat success can not but be advantageous to this important and growingindustry. There have been some questions raised between the two Governmentsas to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties ofnaturalization, but recent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show thatfavorable progress is making toward an understanding in accordance with theviews of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction whateverbetween the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of the UnitedStates. In practice the complaints of molestation suffered by naturalizedcitizens abroad have never been fewer than at present.There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relationswith the Governments of Austria Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Sweden andNorway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Greece.During the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine ofthis country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at,boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government. Thecircumstances as reported involve not only a private injury to the personsconcerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly relationsexisting for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong wasbrought to the attention of the Spanish Government in a serious protest andremonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royalauthorities with a view to such explanation or reparation as may be calledfor by the facts.The commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of ourcitizens against the Government of Spain is, I hope, approaching thetermination of its labors.The claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with Spainwere submitted to Congress for its action at the late session, and I againinvite your attention to this long standing question, with a view to afinal disposition of the matter.At the invitation of the Spanish Government, a conference has recently beenheld at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreignpowers of native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The minister of the UnitedStates in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of thisconference, the result of which is a convention signed on behalf of all thepowers represented. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for itsconsideration. The Government of the United States has also lost noopportunity to urge upon that of the Emperor of Morocco the necessity, inaccordance with the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting anend to the persecutions, which have been so prevalent in that country, ofpersons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrewresidents of Morocco.The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officiallypromulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate ofthe United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowedfor ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the period forratification.The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed onaccount of the objection of the Danish Government to the usual clauseproviding that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of thepersons whose extradition it asks.The provision made by Congress at its last session for the expense of thecommission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with theImperial Government of China on subjects of great interest to the relationsof the two countries enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upontheir mission. The Imperial Government was prepared to give prompt andrespectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and theconferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that on the 17th ofNovember last two treaties were signed at Peking, one relating to theintroduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr.Trescot, one of the commissioners, is now on his way home bringing thetreaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to belaid before the Senate early in January.Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal reliefof shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress thepropriety of making provision for the erection of suitable fireproofbuildings at the Japanese capital for the use of the American legation andthe court house and jail connected with it. The Japanese Government, withgreat generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligiblepiece of land.In my last annual message I invited the attention of Congress to thesubject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from China andJapan. I renew the recommendation then made that whatever portions of thesefunds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid and the residuereturned to the nations, respectively, to which they justly and equitablybelong.The extradition treaty with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Which has beenfor some time in course of negotiation, has during the past year beenconcluded and duly ratified.Relations of friendship and amity have been established between theGovernment of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent adiplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have received at this capitalthe special envoy who has been charged by His Royal Highness Prince Charlesto announce the independent sovereignty of Roumania. We hope for a speedydevelopment of commercial relations between the two countries.In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quieton the border between this country and Mexico would soon become so assuredas to justify the modification of the orders then in force to our militarycommanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging suchdisturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events movedin accordance with these expectations, and the orders were accordinglywithdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the MexicanGovernment. Subsequently the peace of the border was again disturbed by asavage foray under the command of the Chief Victoria, but by the combinedand harmonious action of the military forces of both countries his band hasbeen broken up and substantially destroyed.There is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long preventedrapid and convenient communication between the United States and Mexico byrailways are on the point of disappearing, and that several importantenterprises of this character will soon be set on foot, which can not failto contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries.New envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua haverecently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and enlightenmentafford the best guaranty of the continuance of friendly relations betweenourselves and these sister Republics.The relations between this Government and that of the United States ofColombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly byreason of the project of an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus ofPanama, to be built by private capital under a concession from theColombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations subsistingbetween the United States and Colombia, by which we guarantee theneutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia inthe Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which sostupendous a change in the region embraced in this guaranty should beeffected transforming, as it would, this Isthmus from a barrier betweenthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a gateway and thoroughfare betweenthem for the navies and the merchant ships of the world should receive theapproval of this Government, as being compatible with the discharge ofthese obligations on our part and consistent with our interests as theprincipal commercial power of the Western Hemisphere. The views which Iexpressed in a special message to Congress in March last in relation tothis project I deem it my duty again to press upon your attention.Subsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it is theright and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervisionand authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connectsNorth and South America as will protect our national interest."The war between the Republic of Chile on the one hand and the alliedRepublics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This Governmenthas not felt called upon to interfere in a contest that is within thebelligerent rights of the parties as independent states. We have, however,always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating theirdifference, and have at different times reminded both belligerents of ourwillingness to render such service.Our good offices in this direction were recently accepted by all thebelligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I regretto announce that the measures which the ministers of the United States atSantiago and Lima were authorized to take with the view to bring about apeace were not successful. In the course of the war some questions havearisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these the ministers of theUnited States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness andenergy in protection of American interests.The relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue to bemost cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to theirmutual advantage.The internal disorders with which the Argentine Republic has for some timepast been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its externaltrade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy resultmay be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of thatRepublic, as well as to the development of its vast interior resources.In Samoa the Government of King Malietoa, under the support and recognitionof the consular representatives of the United States, Great Britain, andGermany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity to the islands. Whileit does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartitelocal government which has been proposed, the common interests of the threegreat treaty powers require harmony in their relations to the native frameof government, and this may be best secured by a simple diplomaticagreement between them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction ofour representative at Apia were increased in extent and importance so as toguard American interests in the surrounding and outlying islands ofOceanica.The obelisk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of NewYork has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be erected in thatmetropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt haslately concluded its work, and this Government, at the earnest solicitationof the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will belaid before Congress for its information. A commission for the revision ofthe judicial code of the reform tribunal of Egypt is now in session inCairo. Mr. Farman, consul general, and J. M. Batchelder, esq., have beenappointed as commissioners to participate in this work. The organization ofthe reform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of fiveyears.In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitationshave been extended to foreign maritime states to join in a sanitaryconference in Washington, beginning the 1st of January. The acceptance ofthis invitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in thisimportant measure, designed to establish a system of internationalnotification by which the spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may bemore effectively checked or prevented. The attention of Congress is invitedto the necessary appropriations for carrying into effect the provisions ofthe act referred to.The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce ofthe United States, through the active agency of consular officers andthrough the dissemination of information obtained from them, have beenunrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our commercialcommunities, and the value of the information secured by this means to thetrade and manufactures of the country were recognized by Congress at itslast session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication ofconsular and other reports by the Department of State. The first issue ofthis publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularlybe expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports ofconsular officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by allclasses of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It isbelieved that the system of such publications is deserving of the approvalof Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continuance andenlargement will commend itself to your consideration.The prosperous energies of our domestic industries and their immenseproduction of the subjects of foreign commerce invite, and even require, anactive development of the wishes and interests of our people in thatdirection. Especially important is it that our commercial relations withthe Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies andthe Gulf of Mexico, should be direct, and not through the circuit ofEuropean systems, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. The fullappreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific Oceangives to commerce with Japan, China, and the East Indies, with Australiaand the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, shouldinspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping and to administerby our own capital a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modificationsof our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful tomeet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and ofour carrying trade I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready tosupply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so dearly useful andefficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seemsto be very evident that the provision of regular steam postal communicationby aid from government has been the forerunner of the commercialpredominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater sharein whose trade is now the desire and the intent of our people. It is alsomanifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with GreatBritain for a share of this commerce have been successful in proportionwith their adoption of regular steam postal communication with the marketswhose trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxiousto receive such postal communication with this country and to aid in theirdevelopment. Similar cooperation may be looked for in due time from theEastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead inthis movement can be expected from private interests. In respect of foreigncommerce quite as much as in internal trade postal communication seemsnecessarily a matter of common and public administration, and thuspertaining to Government. I respectfully recommend to your prompt attentionsuch just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of ourforeign commercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade.In this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service whichmight be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the PacificOcean were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the SandwichIslands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. Thegreat influence of such means of communication on these routes ofnavigation in developing and securing the due share of our Pacific Coast inthe commerce of the world needs no illustration or enforcement. It may bethat such an enterprise, useful, and in the end profitable, as it wouldprove to private investment, may need to be accelerated by prudentlegislation by Congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your carefulconsideration.An additional and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for fosteringand enlarging the Navy may be found in the unquestionable service to theexpansion of our commerce which would be rendered by the frequentcirculation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of theglobe. Ships of the proper construction and equipment to be of the greatestefficiency in case of maritime war might be made constant and active agentsin time of peace in the advancement and protection of our foreign trade andin the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would naturally in somenumbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchantsat home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an activemovement of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal ofour naval officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is ajust subject of national pride.The condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by thereport of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It isbelieved that the present financial situation of the United States, whetherconsidered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or theextent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of anyother country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of anycountry at any period of its history. All our industries are thriving; therate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed; a vastimmigration is increasing our population, capital, and labor; newenterprises in great number are in progress, and our commercial relationswith other countries are improving.The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1880, were From customs   $186,522,064.60From internal revenue   124,009,373.92From sales of public lands   1,016,506.60From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks   7,014,971.44From repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies   1,707,367.18From sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies   786,621.22From customs fees, fines, penalties, etc   1,148,800.16From fees consular, letters patent, and lands   2,337,029.00From proceeds of sales of Government property   282,616.50From profits on coinage, etc   2,792,186.78From revenues of the District of Columbia   1,809,469.70From miscellaneous sources   4,099,603.88  
Benjamin Harrison
To the Senate and House of Representatives:There are few transactions in the administration of the Government that areeven temporarily held in the confidence of those charged with the conductof the public business. Every step taken is under the observation of anintelligent and watchful people. The state of the Union is known from dayto day, and suggestions as to needed legislation find an earlier voice thanthat which speaks in these annual communications of the President toCongress.Good will and cordiality have characterized our relations andcorrespondence with other governments, and the year just closed leaves fewinternational questions of importance remaining unadjusted. No obstacle isbelieved to exist that can long postpone the consideration and adjustmentof the still pending questions upon satisfactory and honorable terms. Thedealings of this Government with other states have been and should alwaysbe marked by frankness and sincerity, our purposes avowed, and our methodsfree from intrigue. This course has borne rich fruit in the past, and it isour duty as a nation to preserve the heritage of good repute which acentury of right dealing with foreign governments has secured to us.It is a matter of high significance and no less of congratulation that thefirst year of the second century of our constitutional existence finds ashonored guests within our borders the representatives of all theindependent States of North and South America met together in earnestconference touching the best methods of perpetuating and expanding therelations of mutual interest and friendliness existing among them. That theopportunity thus afforded for promoting closer international relations andthe increased prosperity of the States represented will be used for themutual good of all I can not permit myself to doubt. Our people will awaitwith interest and confidence the results to flow from so auspicious ameeting of allied and in large part identical interests.The recommendations of this international conference of enlightenedstatesmen will doubtless have the considerate attention of Congress and itscooperation in the removal of unnecessary barriers to beneficialintercourse between the nations of America. But while the commercialresults which it is hoped will follow this conference are worthy of pursuitand of the great interests they have excited, it is believed that thecrowning benefit will be found in the better securities which may bedevised for the maintenance of peace among all American nations and thesettlement of all contentions by methods that a Christian civilization canapprove. While viewing with interest our national resources and products,the delegates will, I am sure, find a higher satisfaction in the evidencesof unselfish friendship which everywhere attend their intercourse with ourpeople.Another international conference having great possibilities for good haslately assembled and is now in session in this capital. An invitation wasextended by the Government, under the act of Congress of July 9, 1888, toall maritime nations to send delegates to confer touching the revision andamendment of the rules and regulations governing vessels at sea and toadopt a uniform system of marine signals. The response to this invitationhas been very general and very cordial. Delegates from twenty six nationsare present in the conference, and they have entered upon their useful workwith great zeal and with an evident appreciation of its importance. So faras the agreement to be reached may require legislation to give it effect,the cooperation of Congress is confidently relied upon.It is an interesting, if not, indeed, an unprecedented, fact that the twointernational conferences have brought together here the accreditedrepresentatives of thirty three nations.Bolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras are now represented by resident envoys ofthe plenipotentiary grade. All the States of the American system nowmaintain diplomatic representation at this capital.In this connection it may be noted that all the nations of the WesternHemisphere, with one exception, send to Washington envoys extraordinary andministers plenipotentiary, being the highest grade accredited to thisGovernment. The United States, on the contrary, sends envoys of lowergrades to some of our sister Republics. Our representative in Paraguay andUruguay is a minister resident, while to Bolivia we send a ministerresident and consul general. In view of the importance of our relationswith the States of the American system, our diplomatic agents in thosecountries should be of the uniform rank of envoy extraordinary and ministerplenipotentiary. Certain missions were so elevated by the last Congresswith happy effect, and I recommend the completion of the reform thus begun,with the inclusion also of Hawaii and Hayti, in view of their relations tothe American system of states.I also recommend that timely provision be made for extending to Hawaii aninvitation to be represented in the international conference now sitting atthis capital.Our relations with China have the attentive consideration which theirmagnitude and interest demand. The failure of the treaty negotiated underthe Administration of my predecessor for the further and more completerestriction of Chinese labor immigration, and with it the legislation ofthe last session of Congress dependent thereon, leaves some questions openwhich Congress should now approach in that wise and just spirit whichshould characterize the relations of two great and friendly powers. Whileour supreme interests demand the exclusion of a laboring element whichexperience has shown to be incompatible with our social life, all steps tocompass this imperative need should be accompanied with a recognition ofthe claim of those strangers now lawfully among us to humane and justtreatment.The accession of the young Emperor of China marks, we may hope, an era ofprogress and prosperity for the great country over which he is called torule.The present state of affairs in respect to the Samoan Islands isencouraging. The conference which was held in this city in the summer of1887 between the representatives of the United States, Germany, and GreatBritain having been adjourned because of the persistent divergence of viewswhich was developed in its deliberations, the subsequent course of eventsin the islands gave rise to questions of a serious character. On the 4th ofFebruary last the German minister at this capital, in behalf of hisGovernment, proposed a resumption of the conference at Berlin. Thisproposition was accepted, as Congress in February last was informed.Pursuant to the understanding thus reached, commissioners were appointed byme, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who proceeded toBerlin, where the conference was renewed. The deliberations extendedthrough several weeks, and resulted in the conclusion of a treaty whichwill be submitted to the Senate for its approval. I trust that the effortswhich have been made to effect an adjustment of this question will beproductive of the permanent establishment of law and order in Samoa uponthe basis of the maintenance of the rights and interests of the natives aswell as of the treaty powers.The questions which have arisen during the past few years between GreatBritain and the United States are in abeyance or in course of amicableadjustment.On the part of the government of the Dominion of Canada an effort has beenapparent during the season just ended to administer the laws andregulations applicable to the fisheries with as little occasion forfriction as was possible, and the temperate representations of thisGovernment in respect of cases of undue hardship or of harshinterpretations have been in most cases met with measures of transitoryrelief. It is trusted that the attainment of our just rights under existingtreaties and in virtue of the concurrent legislation of the two contiguouscountries will not be long deferred and that all existing causes ofdifference may be equitably adjusted.I recommend that provision be made by an international agreement forvisibly marking the water boundary between the United States and Canada inthe narrow channels that join the Great Lakes. The conventional linetherein traced by the northwestern boundary survey years ago is not in allcases readily ascertainable for the settlement of jurisdictionalquestions.A just and acceptable enlargement of the list of offenses for whichextradition may be claimed and granted is most desirable between thiscountry and Great Britain. The territory of neither should become a secureharbor for the evil doers of the other through any avoidable shortcoming inthis regard. A new treaty on this subject between the two powers has beenrecently negotiated and will soon be laid before the Senate.The importance of the commerce of Cuba and Puerto Rico with the UnitedStates, their nearest and principal market, justifies the expectation thatthe existing relations may be beneficially expanded. The impedimentsresulting from varying dues on navigation and from the vexatious treatmentof our vessels on merely technical grounds of complaint in West India portsshould be removed.The progress toward an adjustment of pending claims between the UnitedStates and Spain is not as rapid as could be desired.Questions affecting American interests in connection with railwaysconstructed and operated by our citizens in Peru have claimed the attentionof this Government. It is urged that other governments in pressing Peru tothe payment of their claims have disregarded the property rights ofAmerican citizens. The matter will be carefully investigated with a view tosecuring a proper and equitable adjustment.A similar issue is now pending with Portugal. The Delagoa Bay Railway, inAfrica, was constructed under a concession by Portugal to an Americancitizen. When nearly completed the road was seized by the agents of thePortuguese Government. Formal protest has been made through our minister atLisbon against this act, and no proper effort will be spared to secureproper relief.In pursuance of the charter granted by Congress and under the terms of itscontract with the Government of Nicaragua the Interoceanic Canal Companyhas begun the construction of the important waterway between the two oceanswhich its organization contemplates. Grave complications for a time seemedimminent, in view of a supposed conflict of jurisdiction between Nicaraguaand Costa Rica in regard to the accessory privileges to be conceded by thelatter Republic toward the construction of works on the San Juan River, ofwhich the right bank is Costa Rican territory. I am happy to learn that afriendly arrangement has been effected between the two nations. ThisGovernment has held itself ready to promote in every proper way theadjustment of all questions that might present obstacles to the completionof a work of such transcendent importance to the commerce of this country,and, indeed, to the commercial interests of the world.The traditional good feeling between this country and the French Republichas received additional testimony in the participation of our Governmentand people in the international exposition held at Paris during the pastsummer. The success of our exhibitors has been gratifying. The report ofthe commission will be laid before Congress in due season.This Government has accepted, under proper reserve as to its policy inforeign territories, the invitation of the Government of Belgium to takepart in an international congress, which opened at Brussels on the 16th ofNovember, for the purpose of devising measures to promote the abolition ofthe slave trade in Africa and to prevent the shipment of slaves by sea. Ourinterest in the extinction of this crime against humanity in the regionswhere it yet survives has been increased by the results of emancipationwithin our own borders.With Germany the most cordial relations continue. The questions arisingfrom the return to the Empire of Germans naturalized in this country areconsidered and disposed of in a temperate spirit to the entire satisfactionof both Governments.It is a source of great satisfaction that the internal disturbances of theRepublic of Hayti are at last happily ended, and that an apparently stablegovernment has been constituted. It has been duly recognized by the UnitedStates.A mixed commission is now in session in this capital for the settlement oflong standing claims against the Republic of Venezuela, and it is hopedthat a satisfactory conclusion will be speedily reached. This Governmenthas not hesitated to express its earnest desire that the boundary disputenow pending between Great Britain and Venezuela may be adjusted amicablyand in strict accordance with the historic title of the parties.The advancement of the Empire of Japan has been evidenced by the recentpromulgation of a new constitution, containing valuable guaranties ofliberty and providing for a responsible ministry to conduct theGovernment.It is earnestly recommended that our judicial rights and processes in Koreabe established on a firm basis by providing the machinery necessary tocarry out treaty stipulations in that regard.The friendliness of the Persian Government continues to be shown by itsgenerous treatment of Americans engaged in missionary labors and by thecordial disposition of the Shah to encourage the enterprise of our citizensin the development of Persian resources.A discussion is in progress touching the jurisdictional treaty rights ofthe United States in Turkey. An earnest effort will be made to define thoserights to the satisfaction of both Governments.Questions continue to arise in our relations with several countries inrespect to the rights of naturalized citizens. Especially is this the casewith France, Italy, Russia, and Turkey, and to a less extent withSwitzerland. From time to time earnest efforts have been made to regulatethis subject by conventions with those countries. An improper use ofnaturalization should not be permitted, but it is most important that thosewho have been duly naturalized should everywhere be accorded recognition ofthe rights pertaining to the citizenship of the country of their adoption.The appropriateness of special conventions for that purpose is recognizedin treaties which this Government has concluded with a number of EuropeanStates, and it is advisable that the difficulties which now arise in ourrelations with other countries on the same subject should be similarlyadjusted.The recent revolution in Brazil in favor of the establishment of arepublican form of government is an event of great interest to the UnitedStates. Our minister at Rio de Janeiro was at once instructed to maintainfriendly diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government, and theBrazilian representatives at this capital were instructed by theProvisional Government to continue their functions. Our friendlyintercourse with Brazil has therefore suffered no interruption.Our minister has been further instructed to extend on the part of thisGovernment a formal and cordial recognition of the new Republic so soon asthe majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their assent toits establishment and maintenance.Within our own borders a general condition of prosperity prevails. Theharvests of the last summer were exceptionally abundant, and the tradeconditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season to themerchant and the manufacturer and general employment to our workingpeople.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury for the fiscal year ending June30, 1889, has been prepared and will be presented to Congress. It presentswith clearness the fiscal operations of the Government, and I avail myselfof it to obtain some facts for use here.The aggregate receipts from all sources for the year were $387,050,058.84,derived as follows:From customs   $223, 832, 741.69From internal revenue   130,881,513.92From miscellaneous sources   32,335,803.23The ordinary expenditures for the same period were $281,996,615.60, and thetotal expenditures, including the sinking fund, were $329,579,929.25. Theexcess of receipts over expenditures was, after providing for the sinkingfund, $57,470,129.59.For the current fiscal year the total revenues, actual and estimated are$385,000,000, and the ordinary expenditures, actual and estimated, are$293,000,000, making with the sinking fund a total expenditure of$341,321,116.99, leaving an estimated surplus of $43,678,883.01.During the fiscal year there was applied to the purchase of bonds, inaddition to those for the sinking fund, $90,456,172.35, and during thefirst quarter of the current year the sum of $37,838,937.77, all of whichwere credited to the sinking fund. The revenues for the fiscal year endingJune 30, 1891, are estimated by the Treasury Department at $385,000,000,and the expenditures for the same period, including the sinking fund, at$341,430,477.70. This shows an estimated surplus for that year of$43,569,522.30, which is more likely to be increased than reduced when theactual transactions are written up.The existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should have theimmediate attention of Congress, with a view to reducing the receipts ofthe Treasury to the needs of the Government as closely as may be. Thecollection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessaryburden upon our people, and the presence of so large a surplus in thepublic vaults is a disturbing element in the conduct of private business.It has called into use expedients for putting it into circulation of veryquestionable propriety. We should not collect revenue for the purpose ofanticipating our bonds beyond the requirements of the sinking fund, but anyunappropriated surplus in the Treasury should be so used, as there is noother lawful way of returning the money to circulation, and the profitrealized by the Government offers a substantial advantage.The loaning of public funds to the banks without interest Upon the securityof Government bonds I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient. Itresults in a temporary and unnatural increase of the banking capital offavored localities and compels a cautious and gradual recall of thedeposits to avoid injury to the commercial interests. It is not to beexpected that the banks having these deposits will sell their bonds to theTreasury so long as the present highly beneficial arrangement is continued.They now practically get interest both upon the bonds and their proceeds.No further use should be made of this method of getting the surplus intocirculation, and the deposits now outstanding should be gradually withdrawnand applied to the purchase of bonds. It is fortunate that such a use canbe made of the existing surplus, and for some time to come of any casualsurplus that may exist after Congress has taken the necessary steps for areduction of the revenue. Such legislation should be promptly but veryconsiderately enacted.I recommend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrativefeatures and in the schedules. The need of the former is generallyconceded, and an agreement upon the evils and inconveniences to be remediedand the best methods for their correction will probably not be difficult.Uniformity of valuation at all our ports is essential, and effectivemeasures should be taken to secure it. It is equally desirable thatquestions affecting rates and classifications should be promptly decided.The preparation of a new schedule of customs duties is a matter of greatdelicacy because of its direct effect upon the business of the country, andof great difficulty by reason of the wide divergence of opinion as to theobjects that may properly be promoted by such legislation. Some disturbanceof business may perhaps result from the consideration of this subject byCongress, but this temporary ill effect will be reduced to the minimum byprompt action and by the assurance which the country already enjoys thatany necessary changes will be so made as not to impair the just andreasonable protection of our home industries. The inequalities of the lawshould be adjusted, but the protective principle should be maintained andfairly applied to the products of our farms as well as of our shops. Theseduties necessarily have relation to other things besides the publicrevenues. We can not limit their effects by fixing our eyes on the publicTreasury alone. They have a direct relation to home production, to work, towages, and to the commercial independence of our country, and the wise andpatriotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include allof these. The necessary reduction in our public revenues can, I am sure, bemade without making the smaller burden more onerous than the larger byreason of the disabilities and limitations which the process of reductionputs upon both capital and labor. The free list can very safely be extendedby placing thereon articles that do not offer injurious competition to suchdomestic products as our home labor can supply. The removal of the internaltax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from aburden which was imposed only because our revenue from customs duties wasinsufficient for the public needs. If safe provision against fraud can bedevised, the removal of the tax upon spirits used in the arts and inmanufactures would also offer an unobjectionable method of reducing thesurplus.A table presented by the Secretary of the Treasury showing the amount ofmoney of all kinds in circulation each year from 1878 to the present timeis of interest. It appears that the amount of national bank notes incirculation has decreased during that period $114,109,729, of which$37,799,229 is chargeable to the last year. The withdrawal of bankcirculation will necessarily continue under existing conditions. It isprobable that the adoption of the suggestions made by the Comptroller ofthe Currency, namely, that the minimum deposit of bonds for theestablishment of banks be reduced and that an issue of notes to the parvalue of the bonds be allowed, would help to maintain the bank circulation.But while this withdrawal of bank notes has been going on there has been alarge increase in the amount of gold and silver coin in circulation and inthe issues of gold and silver certificates.The total amount of money of all kinds in circulation on March 1, 1878, was$805,793,807, while on October 1, 1889, the total was $1,405,018,000. Therewas an increase of $293,417,552 in gold coin, of $57,554,100 in standardsilver dollars, of $72,311,249 in gold certificates, of $276,619,715 insilver certificates, and of $14,073,787 in United States notes, making atotal of $713,976,403. There was during the same period a decrease of$114,109,729 in bank circulation and of $642,481 in subsidiary silver. Thenet increase was $599,224,193. The circulation per capita has increasedabout $5 during the time covered by the table referred to.The total coinage of silver dollars was on November 1, 1889, $343,638,001,of which $283,539,521 were in the Treasury vaults and $60,098,480 were incirculation. Of the amount in the vaults $277,319,944 were represented byoutstanding silver certificates, leaving $6,219,577 not in circulation andnot represented by certificates.The law requiring the purchase by the Treasury of $2,000,000 worth ofsilver bullion each month, to be coined into silver dollars of 412 1/2grains, has been observed by the Department, but neither the presentSecretary nor any of his predecessors has deemed it safe to exercise thediscretion given by law to increase the monthly purchases to $4,000,000.When the law was enacted (February 28, 1878) the price of silver in themarket was $1.204 per ounce, making the bullion value of the dollar 93cents. Since that time the price has fallen as low as 91.2 cents per ounce,reducing the bullion value of the dollar to 70.6 cents. Within the last fewmonths the market price has somewhat advanced, and on the 1st day ofNovember last the bullion value of the silver dollar was 72 cents.The evil anticipations which have accompanied the coinage and use of thesilver dollar have not been realized. As a coin it has not had general use,and the public Treasury has been compelled to store it. But this ismanifestly owing to the fact that its paper representative is moreconvenient. The general acceptance and the use of the silver certificateshow that silver has not been otherwise discredited. Some favorableconditions have contributed to maintain this practical equality in theircommercial use between the gold and silver dollars; but some of these aretrade conditions that statutory enactments do not control and of thecontinuance of which we can not be certain.I think it is clear that if we should make the coinage of silver at thepresent ratio free we must expect that the difference in the bullion valuesof the gold and silver dollars will be taken account of in commercialtransactions; and I fear the same result would follow any considerableincrease of the present rate of coinage. Such a result would bediscreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all businessinterests. We should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril. And,indeed, nothing more harmful could happen to the silver interests. Any safelegislation upon this subject must secure the equality of the two coins intheir commercial uses.I have always been an advocate of the use of silver in our currency. We arelarge producers of that metal, and should not discredit it. To the planwhich will be presented by the Secretary of the Treasury for the issuanceof notes or certificates upon the deposit of silver bullion at its marketvalue I have been able to give only a hasty examination, owing to the pressof other matters and to the fact that it has been so recently formulated.The details of such a law require careful consideration, but the generalplan suggested by him seems to satisfy the purpose to continue the use ofsilver in connection with our currency and at the same time to obviate thedanger of which I have spoken. At a later day I may communicate furtherwith Congress upon this subject.The enforcement of the Chinese exclusion act has been found to be verydifficult on the northwestern frontier. Chinamen landing at Victoria findit easy to pass our border, owing to the impossibility with the force atthe command of the customs officers of guarding so long an inland line. TheSecretary of the Treasury has authorized the employment of additionalofficers, who will be assigned to this duty, and every effort will be madeto enforce the law. The Dominion exacts a head tax of $50 for each Chinamanlanded, and when these persons, in fraud of our law, cross into ourterritory and are apprehended our officers do not know what to do withthem, as the Dominion authorities will not suffer them to be sent backwithout a second payment of the tax. An effort will be made to reach anunderstanding that will remove this difficulty.The proclamation required by section 3 of the act of March 2, 1889,relating to the killing of seals and other fur bearing animals, was issuedby me on the 21st day of March, and a revenue vessel was dispatched toenforce the laws and protect the interests of the United States. Theestablishment of a refuge station at Point Barrow, as directed by Congress,was successfully accomplished.Judged by modern standards, we are practically without coast defenses. Manyof the structures we have would enhance rather than diminish the perils oftheir garrisons if subjected to the fire of improved guns, and very few areso located as to give full effect to the greater range of such guns as weare now making for coast defense uses. This general subject has hadconsideration in Congress for some years, and the appropriation for theconstruction of large rifled guns made one year ago was, I am sure, theexpression of a purpose to provide suitable works in which these guns mightbe mounted. An appropriation now made for that purpose would not advancethe completion of the works beyond our ability to supply them with fairlyeffective guns.The security of our coast cities against foreign attacks should not restaltogether in the friendly disposition of other nations. There should be asecond line wholly in our own keeping. I very urgently recommend anappropriation at this session for the construction of such works in ourmost exposed harbors.I approve the suggestion of the Secretary of War that provision be made forencamping companies of the National Guard in our coast works for aspecified time each year and for their training in the use of heavy guns.His suggestion that an increase of the artillery force of the Army isdesirable is also, in this connection, commended to the consideration ofCongress.The improvement of our important rivers and harbors should be promoted bythe necessary appropriations. Care should be taken that the Government isnot committed to the prosecution of works not of public and generaladvantage and that the relative usefulness of works of that class is notoverlooked. So far as this work can ever be said to be completed, I do notdoubt that the end would be sooner and more economically reached if fewerseparate works were undertaken at the same time, and those selected fortheir greater general interest were more rapidly pushed to completion. Awork once considerably begun should not be subjected to the risks anddeterioration which interrupted or insufficient appropriations necessarilyoccasion.The assault made by David S. Terry upon the person of Justice Field, of theSupreme Court of the United States, at Lathtop, Cal., in August last, andthe killing of the assailant by a deputy United States marshal who had beendeputed to accompany Justice Field and to protect him from anticipatedviolence at the hands of Terry, in connection with the legal proceedingswhich have followed, suggest questions which, in my judgment, are worthy ofthe attention of Congress.I recommend that more definite provision be made by law not only for theprotection of Federal officers, but for a full trial of such cases in theUnited States courts. In recommending such legislation I do not at allimpeach either the general adequacy of the provision made by the State lawsfor the protection of all citizens or the general good disposition of thosecharged with the execution of such laws to give protection to the officersof the United States. The duty of protecting its officers, as such, and ofpunishing those who assault them on account of their official acts shouldnot be devolved expressly or by acquiescence upon the local authorities.Events which have been brought to my attention happening in other parts ofthe country have also suggested the propriety of extending by legislationfuller protection to those who may be called as witnesses in the courts ofthe United States. The law compels those who are supposed to have knowledgeof public offenses to attend upon our courts and grand juries and to giveevidence. There is a manifest resulting duty that these witnesses shall beprotected from injury on account of their testimony. The investigations ofcriminal offenses are often rendered futile and the punishment of crimeimpossible by the intimidation of witnesses.The necessity of providing some more speedy method for disposing of thecases which now come for final adjudication to the Supreme Court becomesevery year more apparent and urgent. The plan of providing someintermediate courts having final appellate jurisdiction of certain classesof questions and cases has, I think, received a more general approval fromthe bench and bar of the country than any other. Without attempting todiscuss details, I recommend that provision be made for the establishmentof such courts.The salaries of the judges of the district courts in many of the districtsare, in my judgment, inadequate. I recommend that all such salaries nowbelow $5,000 per annum be increased to that amount. It is quite true thatthe amount of labor performed by these judges is very unequal, but as theycan not properly engage in other pursuits to supplement their incomes thesalary should be such in all cases as to provide an independent andcomfortable support.Earnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of thequestion how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonlycalled "trusts" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as theyoften are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize theproduction or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, theyare dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be made thesubject of prohibitory and even penal legislation.The subject of an international copyright has been frequently commended tothe attention of Congress by my predecessors. The enactment of such a lawwould be eminently wise and just.Our naturalization laws should be so revised as to make the inquiry intothe moral character and good disposition toward our Government of thepersons applying for citizenship more thorough. This can only be done bytaking fuller control of the examination, by fixing the times for hearingsuch applications, and by requiring the presence of some one who shallrepresent the Government in the inquiry. Those who are the avowed enemiesof social order or who come to our shores to swell the injurious influenceand to extend the evil practices of any association that defies our lawsshould not only be denied citizenship, but a domicile.The enactment of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a permanentpart of our general legislation is desirable. It should be simple in itsmethods and inexpensive in its administration.The report of the Postmaster General not only exhibits the operations ofthe Department for the last fiscal year, but contains many valuablesuggestions for the improvement and extension of the service, which arecommended to your attention. No other branch of the Government has so closea contact with the daily life of the people. Almost everyone uses theservice it offers, and every hour gained in the transmission of the greatcommercial mails has an actual and possible value that only those engagedin trade can understand.The saving of one day in the transmission of the mails between New York andSan Francisco, which has recently been accomplished, is an incident worthyof mention.The plan suggested of a supervision of the post offices in separatedistricts that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of theefficiency of the postmasters would, I have no doubt, greatly improve theservice.A pressing necessity exists for the erection of a building for the jointuse of the Department and of the city post office. The Department waspartially relieved by renting .outside quarters for a part of its force,but it is again overcrowded. The building used by the city office never wasfit for the purpose, and is now inadequate and unwholesome.The unsatisfactory condition of the law relating to the transmissionthrough the mails of lottery advertisements and remittances is clearlystated by the Postmaster General, and his suggestion as to amendmentsshould have your favorable consideration.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a reorganization of thebureaus of the Department that will, I do not doubt, promote the efficiencyof each.In general, satisfactory progress has been made in the construction of thenew ships of war authorized by Congress. The first vessel of the new Navy,the Dolphin, was subjected to very severe trial tests and to very muchadverse criticism; but it is gratifying to be able to state that a cruisearound the world, from which she has recently returned, has demonstratedthat she is a first class vessel of her rate.The report of the Secretary shows that while the effective force of theNavy is rapidly increasing by reason of the improved build and armament ofthe new ships, the number of our ships fit for sea duty grows very slowly.We had on the 4th of March last 37 serviceable ships, and though 4 havesince been added to the list, the total has not been increased, because inthe meantime 4 have been lost or condemned. Twenty six additional vesselshave been authorized and appropriated for; but it is probable that whenthey are completed our list will only be increased to 42 a gain of 5. Theold wooden ships are disappearing almost as fast as the new vessels areadded. These facts carry their own argument. One of the new ships may infighting strength be equal to two of the old, but it can not do thecruising duty of two. It is important, therefore, that we should have amore rapid increase in the number of serviceable ships. I concur in therecommendation of the Secretary that the construction of 8 armored ships, 3gunboats, and 5 torpedo boats be authorized.An appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessels on duty at theSamoan Islands, in the harbor of Apia, in March last, involving the loss of4 officers and 47 seamen, of two vessels, the Trenton and the Vandalia, andthe disabling of a third, the Nipsic. Three vessels of the German navy,also in the harbor, shared with our ships the force of the hurricane andsuffered even more heavily. While mourning the brave officers and men whodied facing with high resolve perils greater than those of battle, it ismost gratifying to state that the credit of the American Navy forseamanship, courage, and generosity was magnificently sustained in thestorm beaten harbor of Apia.The report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the transactions ofthe Government with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress has been madein the education of the children of school age and in the allotment oflands to adult Indians. It is to be regretted that the policy of breakingup the tribal relation and of dealing with the Indian as an individual didnot appear earlier in our legislation. Large reservations held in commonand the maintenance of the authority of the chiefs and headmen havedeprived the individual of every incentive to the exercise of thrift, andthe annuity has contributed an affirmative impulse toward a state ofconfirmed pauperism.Our treaty stipulations should be observed with fidelity and ourlegislation should be highly considerate of the best interests of anignorant and helpless people. The reservations are now generally surroundedby white settlements. We can no longer push the Indian back into thewilderness, and it remains only by every suitable agency to push him upwardinto the estate of a self supporting and responsible citizen. For the adultthe first step is to locate him upon a farm, and for the child to place himin a school.School attendance should be promoted by every moral agency, and thosefailing should be compelled. The national schools for Indians have beenvery successful and should be multiplied, and as far as possible should beso organized and conducted as to facilitate the transfer of the schools tothe States or Territories in which they are located when the Indians in aneighborhood have accepted citizenship and have become otherwise fitted forsuch a transfer. This condition of things will be attained slowly, but itwill be hastened by keeping it in mind; and in the meantime thatcooperation between the Government and the mission schools which haswrought much good should be cordially and impartially maintained.The last Congress enacted two distinct laws relating to negotiations withthe Sioux Indians of Dakota for a relinquishment of a portion of theirlands to the United States and for dividing the remainder into separatereservations. Both were approved on the same day March 2. The onesubmitted to the Indians a specific proposition; the other (section 3 ofthe Indian appropriation act) authorized the President to appoint threecommissioners to negotiate with these Indians for the accomplishment of thesame general purpose, and required that any agreements made should besubmitted to Congress for ratification.On the 16th day of April last I appointed Hon. Charles Foster, of Ohio,Hon. William Warner, of Missouri, and Major General George Crook, of theUnited States Army, commissioners under the last named law. They were,however, authorized and directed first to submit to the Indians thedefinite proposition made to them by the act first mentioned, and only inthe event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number to thatproposition to open negotiations for modified terms under the other act.The work of the commission was prolonged and arduous, but the assent of therequisite number was, it is understood, finally obtained to the propositionmade by Congress, though the report of the commission has not yet beensubmitted. In view of these facts, I shall not, as at present advised, deemit necessary to submit the agreement to Congress for ratification, but itwill in due course be submitted for information. This agreement releases tothe United States about 9,000,000 acres of land.The commission provided for by section 14 of the Indian appropriation billto negotiate with the Cherokee Indians and all other Indians owning orclaiming lands lying west of the ninety sixth degree of longitude for thecession to the United States of all such lands was constituted by theappointment of Hon. Lucius Fairchild, of Wisconsin, Hon. John F. Hartranft,of Pennsylvania, and Hon. Alfred M. Wilson, of Arkansas, and organized onJune 29 last. Their first conference with the representatives of theCherokees was held at Tahlequah July 29, with no definite results. GeneralJohn F. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, was prevented by ill health from takingpart in the conference. His death, which occurred recently, is justly andgenerally lamented by a people he had served with conspicuous gallantry inwar and with great fidelity in peace. The vacancy thus created was filledby the appointment of Hon. Warren G. Sayre, of Indiana.A second conference between the commission and the Cherokees was begunNovember 6, but no results have yet been obtained, nor is it believed thata conclusion can be immediately expected. The cattle syndicate nowoccupying the lands for grazing purposes is clearly one of the agenciesresponsible for the obstruction of our negotiations with the Cherokees. Thelarge body of agricultural lands constituting what is known as the"Cherokee Outlet" ought not to be, and, indeed, can not long be, held forgrazing and for the advantage of a few against the public interests and thebest advantage of the Indians themselves. The United States has now underthe treaties certain rights in these lands. These will not be usedoppressively, but it can not be allowed that those who by sufferance occupythese lands shall interpose to defeat the wise and beneficent purposes ofthe Government. I can not but believe that the advantageous character ofthe offer made by the United States to the Cherokee Nation for a fullrelease of these lands as compared with other suggestions now made to themwill yet obtain for it a favorable consideration.Under the agreement made between the United States and the Muscogee (orCreek) Nation of Indians on the 19th day of January, 1889, an absolutetitle was secured by the United States to about 3,500,000 acres of land.Section 12 of the general Indian appropriation act approved March 2, 1889,made provision for the purchase by the United States from the Seminoletribe of a certain portion of their lands. The delegates of the SeminoleNation, having first duly evidenced to me their power to act in thatbehalf, delivered a proper release or conveyance to the United States ofall the lands mentioned in the act, which was accepted by me and certifiedto be in compliance with the statute.By the terms of both the acts referred to all the lands so purchased weredeclared to be a part of the public domain and open to settlement under thehomestead law. But of the lands embraced in these purchases, being in theaggregate about 5,500,000 acres, 3,500,000 acres had already, under theterms of the treaty of 1866, been acquired by the United States for thepurpose of settling other Indian tribes thereon and had been appropriatedto that purpose. The land remaining and available for settlement consistedof 1,887,796 acres, surrounded on all sides by lands in the occupancy ofIndian tribes. Congress had provided no civil government for the people whowere to be invited by my proclamation to settle upon these lands, except asthe new court which had been established at Muscogee or the United Statescourts in some of the adjoining States had power to enforce the generallaws of the United States.In this condition of things I was quite reluctant to open the lands tosettlement; but in view of the fact that several thousand persons, many ofthem with their families, had gathered upon the borders of the IndianTerritory with a view to securing homesteads on the ceded lands, and thatdelay would involve them in much loss and suffering, I did on the 23d dayof March last issue a proclamation declaring that the lands thereindescribed would be open to settlement under the provisions of the law onthe 22d day of April following at 12 o\'clock noon. Two land districts hadbeen established and the offices were opened for the transaction ofbusiness when the appointed time arrived.It is much to the credit of the settlers that they very generally observedthe limitation as to the time when they might enter the Territory. Carewill be taken that those who entered in violation of the law do not securethe advantage they unfairly sought. There was a good deal of apprehensionthat the strife for locations would result in much violence and bloodshed,but happily these anticipations were not realized. It is estimated thatthere are now in the Territory about 60,000 people, and severalconsiderable towns have sprung up, for which temporary municipalgovernments have been organized. Guthrie is said to have now a populationof almost 8,000. Eleven schools and nine churches have been established,and three daily and five weekly newspapers are published in this city,whose charter and ordinances have only the sanction of the voluntaryacquiescence of the people from day to day.Oklahoma City has a population of about 5,000, and is proportionately aswell provided as Guthrie with churches, schools, and newspapers. Othertowns and villages having populations of from 100 to 1,000 are scatteredover the Territory.In order to secure the peace of this new community in the absence of civilgovernment, I directed General Merritt, commanding the Department of theMissouri, to act in conjunction with the marshals of the United States topreserve the peace, and upon their requisition to use the troops to aidthem in executing warrants and in quieting any riots or breaches of thepeace that might occur. He was further directed to use his influence topromote good order and to avoid any conflicts between or with the settlers.Believing that the introduction and sale of liquors where no legalrestraints or regulations existed would endanger the public peace, and inview of the fact that such liquors must first be introduced into the Indianreservations before reaching the white settlements, I further directed thegeneral commanding to enforce the laws relating to the introduction ofardent spirits into the Indian country.The presence of the troops has given a sense of security to thewell disposed citizens and has tended to restrain the lawless. In oneinstance the officer in immediate command of the troops went further than Ideemed justifiable in supporting the de facto municipal government ofGuthrie, and he was so informed, and directed to limit the interference ofthe military to the support of the marshals on the lines indicated in theoriginal order. I very urgently recommend that Congress at once provide aTerritorial government for these people. Serious questions, which may atany time lead to violent outbreaks, are awaiting the institution of courtsfor their peaceful adjustment. The American genius for self government hasbeen well illustrated in Oklahoma; but it is neither safe nor wise to leavethese people longer to the expedients which have temporarily served them.Provision should be made for the acquisition of title to town lots in thetowns now established in Alaska, for locating town sites, and for theestablishment of municipal governments. Only the mining laws have beenextended to that Territory, and no other form of title to lands can now beobtained. The general land laws were framed with reference to thedisposition of agricultural lands, and it is doubtful if their operation inAlaska would be beneficial.We have fortunately not extended to Alaska the mistaken policy ofestablishing reservations for the Indian tribes, and can deal with themfrom the beginning as individuals with, I am sure, better results; but anydisposition of the public lands and any regulations relating to timber andto the fisheries should have a kindly regard to their interests. Having nopower to levy taxes, the people of Alaska are wholly dependent upon theGeneral Government, to whose revenues the seal fisheries make a largeannual contribution. An appropriation for education should neither beoverlooked nor stinted.The smallness of the population and the great distances between thesettlements offer serious obstacles to the establishment of the usualTerritorial form of government. Perhaps the organization of severalsub districts with a small municipal council of limited powers for eachwould be safe and useful.Attention is called in this connection to the suggestions of the Secretaryof the Treasury relating to the establishment of another port of entry inAlaska and of other needed customs facilities and regulations.In the administration of the land laws the policy of facilitating in everyproper way the adjustment of the honest claims of individual settlers uponthe public lands has been pursued. The number of pending cases had duringthe preceding Administration been greatly increased under the operation oforders for a time suspending final action in a large part of the casesoriginating in the West and Northwest, and by the subsequent use of unusualmethods of examination. Only those who are familiar with the conditionsunder which our agricultural lands have been settled can appreciate theserious and often fatal consequences to the settler of a policy that putshis title under suspicion or delays the issuance of his patent. While careis taken to prevent and to expose fraud, it should not be imputed withoutreason.The manifest purpose of the homestead and preemption laws was to promotethe settlement of the public domain by persons having a bona fide intent tomake a home upon the selected lands. Where this intent is well establishedand the requirements of the law have been substantially complied with, theclaimant is entitled to a prompt and friendly consideration of his case;but where there is reason to believe that the claimant is the mere agent ofanother who is seeking to evade a law intended to promote small holdingsand to secure by fraudulent methods large tracts of timber and other lands,both principal and agent should not only be thwarted in their fraudulentpurpose, but should be made to feel the full penalties of our criminalstatutes. The laws should be so administered as not to confound these twoclasses and to visit penalties only upon the latter.The unsettled state of the titles to large bodies of lands in theTerritories of New Mexico and Arizona has greatly retarded the developmentof those Territories. Provision should be made by law for the prompt trialand final adjustment before a judicial tribunal or commission of all claimsbased upon Mexican grants. It is not just to an intelligent andenterprising people that their peace should be disturbed and theirprosperity retarded by these old contentions. I express the hope thatdifferences of opinion as to methods may yield to the urgency of the case.The law now provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who wasmustered into the service of the United States during the Civil War and isnow suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in the service and inthe line of duty. Two of the three necessary facts, viz, muster anddisability, are usually susceptible of easy proof; but the third, origin inthe service, is often difficult and in many deserving cases impossible toestablish. That very many of those who endured the hardships of our mostbloody and arduous campaigns are now disabled from diseases that had a realbut not traceable origin in the service I do not doubt. Besides these thereis another class composed of men many of whom served an enlistment of threefull years and of reenlisted veterans who added a fourth year of service,who escaped the casualties of battle and the assaults of disease, who werealways ready for any detail, who were in every battle line of theircommand, and were mustered out in sound health, and have since the close ofthe war, while fighting with the same indomitable and independent spiritthe contests of civil life, been overcome by disease or casualty.I am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large annualexpenditure; neither am I deterred by that fact from recommending thatCongress grant a pension to such honorably discharged soldiers and sailorsof the Civil War as, having rendered substantial service during the war,are now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by disease orcasualty are incapacitated from earning it. Many of the men who would beincluded in this form of relief are now dependent upon public aid, and itdoes not, in my judgment, consist with the national honor that they shallcontinue to subsist upon the local relief given indiscriminately to paupersinstead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation theyserved so gallantly and unselfishly. Our people will, I am sure, verygenerally approve such legislation. And I am equally sure that thesurvivors of the Union Army and Navy will feel a grateful sense of reliefwhen this worthy and suffering class of their comrades is fairly caredfor.There are some manifest inequalities in the existing law that should beremedied. To some of these the Secretary of the Interior has calledattention.It is gratifying to be able to state that by the adoption of new and bettermethods in the War Department the calls of the Pension Office forinformation as to the military and hospital records of pension claimantsare now promptly answered and the injurious and vexatious delays that haveheretofore occurred are entirely avoided. This will greatly facilitate theadjustment of all pending claims.The advent of four new States South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, andWashington into the Union under the Constitution in the same month, andthe admission of their duly chosen representatives to our National Congressat the same session, is an event as unexampled as it is interesting.The certification of the votes cast and of the constitutions adopted ineach of the States was filed with me, as required by the eighth section ofthe act of February 22, 1889, by the governors of said Territories,respectively. Having after a careful examination found that the severalconstitutions and governments were republican in form and not repugnant tothe Constitution of the United States, that all the provisions of the actof Congress had been complied with, and that a majority of the votes castin each of said proposed States was in favor of the adoption of theconstitution submitted therein, I did so declare by a separate proclamationas to each as to North Dakota and South Dakota on Saturday, November 2; asto Montana on Friday, November 8, and as to Washington on Monday, November11.Each of these States has within it resources the development of which willemploy the energies of and yield a comfortable subsistence to a greatpopulation. The smallest of these new States, Washington, stands twelfth,and the largest, Montana, third, among the forty two in area. The people ofthese States are already well trained, intelligent, and patriotic Americancitizens, having common interests and sympathies with those of the olderStates and a common purpose to defend the integrity and uphold the honor ofthe nation.The attention of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been called to theurgent need of Congressional legislation for the better protection of thelives and limbs of those engaged in operating the great interstate freightlines of the country, and especially of the yardmen and brakemen. Apetition signed by nearly 10,000 railway brakemen was presented to theCommission asking that steps might be taken to bring about the use ofautomatic brakes and couplers on freight cars.At a meeting of State railroad commissioners and their accreditedrepresentatives held at Washington in March last upon the invitation of theInterstate Commerce Commission a resolution was unanimously adopted urgingthe Commission "to consider what can be done to prevent the loss of lifeand limb in coupling and uncoupling freight cars and in handling the brakesof such cars." During the year ending June 30, 1888, over 2,000 railroademployees were killed in service and more than 20,000 injured. It iscompetent, I think, for Congress to require uniformity in the constructionof cars used in interstate commerce and the use of improved safetyappliances upon such trains. Time will be necessary to make the neededchanges, but an earnest and intelligent beginning should be made at once.It is a reproach to our civilization that any class of American workmenshould in the pursuit of a necessary and useful vocation be subjected to aperil of life and limb as great as that of a soldier in time of war.The creation of an Executive Department to be known as the Department ofAgriculture by the act of February 9 last was a wise and timely response toa request which had long been respectfully urged by the farmers of thecountry; but much remains to be done to perfect the organization of theDepartment so that it may fairly realize the expectations which itscreation excited. In this connection attention is called to the suggestionscontained in the report of the Secretary, which is herewith submitted. Theneed of a law officer for the Department such as is provided for the otherExecutive Departments is manifest. The failure of the last Congress to makethe usual provision for the publication of the annual report should bepromptly remedied. The public interest in the report and its value to thefarming community, I am sure, will not be diminished under the neworganization of the Department.I recommend that the weather service be separated from the War Departmentand established as a bureau in the Department of Agriculture. This willinvolve an entire reorganization both of the Weather Bureau and of theSignal Corps, making of the first a purely civil organization and of theother a purely military staff corps. The report of the Chief Signal Officershows that the work of the corps on its military side has beendeteriorating.The interests of the people of the District of Columbia should not be lostsight of in the pressure for consideration of measures affecting the wholecountry. Having no legislature of its own, either municipal or general, itspeople must look to Congress for the regulation of all those concerns thatin the States are the subject of local control. Our whole people have aninterest that the national capital should be made attractive and beautiful,and, above all, that its repute for social order should be well maintained.The laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks in the District shouldbe revised with a view to bringing the traffic under stringent limitationsand control.In execution of the power conferred upon me by the act makingappropriations for the expenses of the District of Columbia for the yearending June 30, 1890, I did on the 17th day of August last appoint RudolphHering, of New York, Samuel M. Gray, of Rhode Island, and Frederick P.Stearns, of Massachusetts, three eminent sanitary engineers, to examine andreport upon the system of sewerage existing in the District of Columbia.Their report, which is not yet completed, will be in due course submittedto Congress.The report of the Commissioners of the District is herewith transmitted,and the attention of Congress is called to the suggestions containedtherein.The proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discoveryof America by the opening of a world\'s fair or exposition in some one ofour great cities will be presented for the consideration of Congress. Thevalue and interest of such an exposition may well claim the promotion ofthe General Government.On the 4th of March last the Civil Service Commission had but a singlemember. The vacancies were filled on the 7th day of May, and since then theCommissioners have been industriously, though with an inadequate force,engaged in executing the law. They were assured by me that a cordialsupport would be given them in the faithful and impartial enforcement ofthe statute and of the rules and regulations adopted in aid of it.Heretofore the book of eligibles has been closed to everyone, except ascertifications were made upon the requisition of the appointing officers.This secrecy was the source of much suspicion and of many charges offavoritism in the administration of the law. What is secret is alwayssuspected; what is open can be judged. The Commission, with the fullapproval of all its members, has now opened the list of eligibles to thepublic. The eligible lists for the classified post offices andcustom houses are now publicly posted in the respective offices, as arealso the certifications for appointments. The purpose of the civil servicelaw was absolutely to exclude any other consideration in connection withappointments under it than that of merit as tested by the examinations. Thebusiness proceeds upon the theory that both the examining boards and theappointing officers are absolutely ignorant as to the political views andassociations of all persons on the civil service lists. It is not too muchto say, however, that some recent Congressional investigations havesomewhat shaken public confidence in the impartiality of the selections forappointment.The reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advanceuntil the present law and its equal administration are well established inthe confidence of the people. It will be my pleasure, as it is my duty, tosee that the law is executed with firmness and impartiality. If some of itsprovisions have been fraudulently evaded by appointing officers, ourresentment should not suggest the repeal of the law, but reform in itsadministration. We should have one view of the matter, and hold it with asincerity that is not affected by the consideration that the party to whichwe belong is for the time in power.My predecessor, on the 4th day of January, 1889, by an Executive order totake effect March 15, brought the Railway Mail Service under the operationof the civil service law. Provision was made that the order should takeeffect sooner in any State where an eligible list was sooner obtained. Onthe 11th day of March Mr. Lyman, then the only member of the Commission,reported to me in writing that it would not be possible to have the list ofeligibles ready before May 1, and requested that the taking effect of theorder be postponed until that time, which was done, subject to the sameprovision contained in the original order as to States in which an eligiblelist was sooner obtained.As a result of the revision of the rules, of the new classification, and ofthe inclusion of the Railway Mail Service, the work of the Commission hasbeen greatly increased, and the present clerical force is found to beinadequate. I recommend that the additional clerks asked by the Commissionbe appropriated for.The duty of appointment is devolved by the Constitution or by the law, andthe appointing officers are properly held to a high responsibility in itsexercise. The growth of the country and the consequent increase of thecivil list have magnified this function of the Executive disproportionally.It can not be denied, however, that the labor connected with this necessarywork is increased, often to the point of actual distress, by the sudden andexcessive demands that are made upon an incoming Administration forremovals and appointments. But, on the other hand, it is not true thatincumbency is a conclusive argument for continuance in office.Impartiality, moderation, fidelity to public duty, and a good attainment inthe discharge of it must be added before the argument is complete. Whenthose holding administrative offices so conduct themselves as to convincejust political opponents that no party consideration or bias affects in anyway the discharge of their public duties, we can more easily stay thedemand for removals.I am satisfied that both in and out of the classified service great benefitwould accrue from the adoption of some system by which the officer wouldreceive the distinction and benefit that in all private employments comesfrom exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the performance of duty.I have suggested to the heads of the Executive Departments that theyconsider whether a record might not be kept in each bureau of all thoseelements that are covered by the terms "faithfulness" and "efficiency," anda rating made showing the relative merits of the clerks of each class, thisrating to be regarded as a test of merit in making promotions.I have also suggested to the Postmaster General that he adopt some plan bywhich he can, upon the basis of the reports to the Department and offrequent inspections, indicate the relative merit of postmasters of eachclass. They will be appropriately indicated in the Official Register and inthe report of the Department. That a great stimulus would thus be given tothe whole service I do not doubt, and such a record would be the bestdefense against inconsiderate removals from office.The interest of the General Government in the education of the people foundan early expression, not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warningutterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropriations from thecommon resources for the support of education in the new States. No onewill deny that it is of the gravest national concern that those who holdthe ultimate control of all public affairs should have the necessaryintelligence wisely to direct and determine them. National aid to educationhas heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form theconstitutional power of Congress to promote the education of the people isnot seriously questioned. I do not think it can be successfully questionedwhen the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the publicTreasury.Such aid should be, as it always has been, suggested by some exceptionalconditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, thebestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of theability of the States where these new citizens were chiefly found toadequately provide educational facilities presented not only exceptionalbut unexampled conditions. That the situation has been much amelioratedthere is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happilyincreased.But a great work remains to be done, and I think the General Governmentshould lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid ofeducation grows chiefly out of the condition and needs of the emancipatedslave and his descendants, the relief should as far as possible, whilenecessarily proceeding upon some general lines, be applied to the need thatsuggested it. It is essential, if much good is to be accomplished, that thesympathy and active interest of the people of the States should beenlisted, and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate andnot to supplant local taxation for school purposes.As one Congress can not bind a succeeding one in such a case and as theeffort must in some degree be experimental, I recommend that anyappropriation made for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and asto the time over which it is to extend as will on the one hand give thelocal school authorities opportunity to make the best use of the firstyear\'s allowance, and on the other deliver them from the temptation tounduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden themselves.The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us. They were broughthere in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly foundby a cruel slave code. Happily for both races, they are now free. They havefrom a standpoint of ignorance and poverty which was our shame, nottheirs made remarkable advances in education and in the acquisition ofproperty. They have as a people shown themselves to be friendly andfaithful toward the white race under temptations of tremendous strength.They have their representatives in the national cemeteries, where agrateful Government has gathered the ashes of those who died in itsdefense. They have furnished to our Regular Army regiments that have wonhigh praise from their commanding officers for courage and soldierlyqualities and for fidelity to the enlistment oath. In civil life they arenow the toilers of their communities, making their full contribution to thewidening streams of prosperity which these communities are receiving. Theirsudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into thehousehold as well as the shop. Generally they do not desire to quit theirhomes, and their employers resent the interference of the emigration agentswho seek to stimulate such a desire.But notwithstanding all this, in many parts of our country where thecolored population is large the people of that race are by various devicesdeprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many oftheir civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votesare suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.It has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and ofrespect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils.Surely no one supposes that the present can be accepted as a permanentcondition. If it is said that these communities must work out this problemfor themselves, we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Dothey suggest any solution? When and under what conditions is the black manto have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rightswhich have so long been his in law? When is that equality of influencewhich our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to berestored? This generation should courageously face these grave questions,and not leave them as a heritage of woe to the next. The consultationshould proceed with candor, calmness, and great patience, upon the lines ofjustice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty. No question in ourcountry can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of thelaw.I earnestly invoke the attention of Congress to the consideration of suchmeasures within its well defined constitutional powers as will secure toall our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every othercivil right under the Constitution and laws of the United States. No evil,however deplorable, can justify the assumption either on the part of theExecutive or of Congress of powers not granted, but both will be highlyblamable if all the powers granted are not wisely but firmly used tocorrect these evils. The power to take the whole direction and control ofthe election of members of the House of Representatives is clearly given tothe General Government. A partial and qualified supervision of theseelections is now provided for by law, and in my opinion this law may be sostrengthened and extended as to secure on the whole better results than canbe attained by a law taking all the processes of such election into Federalcontrol. The colored man should be protected in all of his relations to theFederal Government, whether as litigant, juror, or witness in our courts,as an elector for members of Congress, or as a peaceful traveler upon ourinterstate railways.There is nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride and nothingmore hurtful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of ourmerchant marine compared with that of other nations whose generalresources, wealth, and seacoast lines do not suggest any reason for theirsupremacy on the sea. It was not always so, and our people are agreed, Ithink, that it shall not continue to be so. It is not possible in thiscommunication to discuss the causes of the decay of our shipping interestsor the differing methods by which it is proposed to restore them. Thestatement of a few well authenticated facts and some general suggestions asto legislation is all that is practicable. That the great steamship linessailing under the flags of England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, andengaged in foreign commerce, were .promoted and have since been and now areliberally aided by grants of public money in one form or another isgenerally known. That the American lines of steamships have been abandonedby us to an unequal contest with the aided lines of other nations untilthey have been withdrawn, or in the few cases where they are stillmaintained are subject to serious disadvantages, is matter of commonknowledge.The present situation is such that travelers and merchandise find Liverpooloften a necessary intermediate port between New York and some of the SouthAmerican capitals. The fact that some of the delegates from South AmericanStates to the conference of American nations now in session at Washingtonreached our shores by reversing that line of travel is very conclusive ofthe need of such a conference and very suggestive as to the first and mostnecessary step in the direction of fuller and more beneficial intercoursewith nations that are now our neighbors upon the lines of latitude, but notupon the lines of established commercial intercourse.I recommend that such appropriations be made for ocean mail service inAmerican steamships between our ports and those of Central and SouthAmerica, China, Japan, and the important islands in both of the greatoceans as will be liberally remunerative for the service rendered and aswill encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize thechances of American steamship lines in the competitions which they mustmeet. That the American States lying south of us will cordially cooperatein establishing and maintaining such lines of steamships to their principalports I do not doubt.We should also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of suchmerchant ships of American construction and of a specified tonnage andspeed as the owners will consent to place at the use of the Government incase of need as armed cruisers. England has adopted this policy, and as aresult can now upon necessity at once place upon her naval list some of thefastest steamships in the world. A proper supervision of the constructionof such vessels would make their conversion into effective ships of warvery easy.I am an advocate of economy in our national expenditures, but it is amisuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds anexpenditure for the purpose of extending our foreign commerce. Theenlargement and improvement of our merchant marine, the development of asufficient body of trained American seamen, the promotion of rapid andregular mail communication between the ports of other countries and ourown, and the adaptation of large and swift American merchant steamships tonaval uses in time of war are public purposes of the highest concern. Theenlarged participation of our people in the carrying trade, the new andincreased markets that will be opened for the products of our farms andfactories, and the fuller and better employment of our mechanics which willresult from a liberal promotion of our foreign commerce insure the widestpossible diffusion of benefit to all the States and to all our people.Everything is most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal andprogressive policy upon this subject, and we should enter upon it withpromptness and decision.The legislation which I have suggested, it is sincerely believed, willpromote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and securityof the people. I invoke the diligent and serious attention of Congress tothe consideration of these and such other measures as may be presentedhaving the same great end in view.
Benjamin Harrison
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The reports of the several Executive Departments, which will be laid beforeCongress in the usual course, will exhibit in detail the operations of theGovernment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents andresults, and chiefly such as may be the foundation of the recommendations Ishall submit, will be referred to in this annual message.The vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted bythe several Departments during the year with faithfulness, energy, andsuccess.The revenues, amounting to above $450,000,000, have been collected anddisbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case ofdefalcation or embezzlement. An earnest effort has been made to stimulate asense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and employees ofevery grade, and the work done by them has almost wholly escapedunfavorable criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because thecredit of this good work is not mine, but is shared by the heads of theseveral Departments with the great body of faithful officers and employeeswho serve under them. The closest scrutiny of Congress is invited to allthe methods of administration and to every item of expenditure.The friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of theEast have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common interestthat bind us to the States of the Western Hemisphere have been notablystrengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider measuresfor the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by Congress,the representatives of every independent State of the American continentand of Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 1889, andcontinued in session until the 19th of last April. This importantconvocation marks a most interesting and influential epoch in the historyof the Western Hemisphere. It is noteworthy that Brazil, invited whileunder an imperial form of government, shared as a republic in thedeliberations and results of the conference. The recommendations of thisconference were all transmitted to Congress at the last session.The International Marine Conference, which sat at Washington last winter,reached a very gratifying result. The regulations suggested have beenbrought to the attention of all the Governments represented, and theirgeneral adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of Congress atthe last session is in conformity with the propositions of the conference,and the proclamation therein provided for will be issued when the otherpowers have given notice of their adhesion.The Conference of Brussels, to devise means for suppressing the slave tradein Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the interest theAmerican people feel in that great work. It soon became evident that themeasure proposed would tax the resources of the Kongo Basin beyond therevenues available under the general act of Berlin of 1884. The UnitedStates, not being a party to that act, could not share in its revision, butby a separate act the Independent State of the Kongo was freed from therestrictions upon a customs revenue. The demoralizing and destructivetraffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnestattention of the conference, and the delegates of the United States wereforemost in advocating measures for its repression. An accord was reachedthe influence of which will be very helpful and extend over a wide region.As soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Netherlands,for a time withheld, the general acts will be submitted for ratification bythe Senate. Meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and completedtreaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United Statesand the Independent State of the Kongo.Toward the end of the past year the only independent monarchical governmenton the Western Continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist, and wassucceeded by a republic. Diplomatic relations were at once established withthe new Government, but it was not completely recognized until anopportunity had been afforded to ascertain that it had popular approval andsupport. When the course of events had yielded assurance of this fact, notime was lost in extending to the new Government a full and cordial welcomeinto the family of American Commonwealths. It is confidently believed thatthe good relations of the two countries will be preserved and that thefuture will witness an increased intimacy of intercourse and an expansionof their mutual commerce.The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through arevolutionary change in Salvador, which was not recognized by other States,and hostilities broke out between Salvador and Guatemala, threatening toinvolve all Central America in conflict and to undo the progress which hadbeen made toward a union of their interests. The efforts of this Governmentwere promptly and zealously exerted to compose their differences, andthrough the active efforts of the representative of the United States aprovisional treaty of peace was signed August 26, whereby the right of theRepublic of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. GeneralEzeta, the chief of the Provisional Government, has since been confirmed inthe Presidency by the Assembly, and diplomatic recognition duly followed.The killing of General Barrundia on board the Pacific mail steamerAcapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala,demanded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt toinvade Guatemala from Mexican territory, General Barrundia took passage atAcapulco for Panama. The consent of the representatives of the UnitedStates was sought to effect his seizure, first at Champerico, where thesteamer touched, and afterwards at San Jose. The captain of the steamerrefused to give up his passenger without a written order from the UnitedStates minister. The latter furnished the desired letter, stipulating asthe condition of his action that General Barrundia\'s life should be sparedand that he should be tried only for offenses growing out of hisinsurrectionary movements. This letter was produced to the captain of theAcapulco by the military commander at San Jose as his warrant to take thepassenger from the steamer. General Barrundia resisted capture and waskilled. It being evident that the minister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded thebounds of his authority in intervening, in compliance with the demands ofthe Guatemalan authorities, to authorize and effect, in violation ofprecedent, the seizure on a vessel of the United States of a passenger intransit charged with political offenses, in order that he might be triedfor such offenses under what was described as martial law, I wasconstrained to disavow Mr. Mizner\'s act and recall him from his post.The Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens, is makingmost encouraging progress, all the preliminary conditions and initialoperations having been accomplished within the prescribed time.During the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement ofthe claims of American citizens against the Government of Chile,principally growing out of the late war with Peru. The reports from ourminister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and satisfactoryadjustment.Our relations with China, which have for several years occupied soimportant a place in our diplomatic history, have called for carefulconsideration and have been the subject of much correspondence.The communications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the wholesubject of our conventional relations with his country, and at the sametime this Government, through its legation at Peking, has sought to arrangevarious matters and complaints touching the interests and protection of ourcitizens in China.In pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October 1, 1890, I haveproposed to the Governments of Mexico and Great Britain to consider aconventional regulation of the passage of Chinese laborers across oursouthern and northern frontiers.On the 22d day of August last Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selectedunder the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an award to the effect thatno compensation was due from the Danish Government to the United States onaccount of what is commonly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim.Our relations with the French Republic continue to be cordial. Ourrepresentative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of therestrictions imposed upon our meat products, and it is believed thatsubstantial progress has been made toward a just settlement.The Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of theUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain, after due ratification andexchange, has begun to produce salutary effects. The formation of thegovernment agreed upon will soon replace the disorder of the past by astable administration alike just to the natives and equitable to the threepowers most concerned in trade and intercourse with the Samoan Islands. Thechief justice has been chosen by the King of Sweden and Norway on theinvitation of the three powers, and will soon be installed. The landcommission and the municipal council are in process of organization. Arational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation, both municipal and uponimports, is in operation. Malietoa is respected as King.The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due ratification,was proclaimed on the 25th of last March. Its beneficial working is alreadyapparent.The difference between the two Governments touching the fur seal questionin the Bering Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by thecorrespondence which will soon be laid before the Congress. The offer tosubmit the question to arbitration, as proposed by Her Majesty\'sGovernment, has not been accepted, for the reason that the form ofsubmission proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a conclusionsatisfactory to either party. It is sincerely hoped that before the openingof another sealing season some arrangement may be effected which willassure to the United States a property right derived from Russia, which wasnot disregarded by any nation for more than eighty years preceding theoutbreak of the existing trouble.In the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii which I ambound to presume was wholly unintentional. Duties were levied on certaincommodities which are included in the reciprocity treaty now existingbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indicating thenecessary exception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope Congress will repairwhat might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith on the part of thisGovernment.An award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of Mr.Van Bokkelen against Hayti was rendered on the 4th of December, 1888, butowing to disorders then and afterwards prevailing in Hayti the terms ofpayment were not observed. A new agreement as to the time of payment hasbeen approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of theUnited States for redress of wrongs suffered during the late politicalconflict in Hayti will, it is hoped, speedily yield to friendly treatment.Propositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between theUnited States and Italy are now under consideration.You will be asked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of theItalian Government to take part in an approaching conference to considerthe adoption of a universal prime meridian from which to reckon longitudeand time. As this proposal follows in the track of the reform sought to beinitiated by the Meridian Conference of Washington, held on the invitationof this Government, the United States should manifest a friendly interestin the Italian proposal.In this connection I may refer with approval to the suggestion of mypredecessors that standing provision be made for accepting, whenever deemedadvisable, the frequent invitations of foreign governments to share inconferences looking to the advancement of international reforms in regardto science, sanitation, commercial laws and procedure, and other mattersaffecting the intercourse and progress of modern communities.In the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatenedto interrupt the cordiality of our relations with the Government ofPortugal. That Government seized the Delagoa Bay Railway, which wasconstructed under a concession granted to an American citizen, and at thesame time annulled the charter. The concessionary, who had embarked hisfortune in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, wascompelled to invoke the protection of his Government. Our representations,made coincidently with those of the British Government, whose subjects werealso largely interested, happily resulted in the recognition by Portugal ofthe propriety of submitting the claim for indemnity growing out of itsaction to arbitration. This plan of settlement having been agreed upon, theinterested powers readily concurred in the proposal to submit the case tothe judgment of three eminent jurists, to be designated by the President ofthe Swiss Republic, who, upon the joint invitation of the Governments ofthe United States, Great Britain, and Portugal, has selected persons wellqualified for the task before them.The revision of our treaty relations with the Empire of Japan has continuedto be the subject of consideration and of correspondence. The questionsinvolved are both grave and delicate; and while it will be my duty to seethat the interests of the United States are not by any changes exposed toundue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfythe legitimate expectations of the Japanese Government and maintain thepresent and long existing friendly relations between Japan and the UnitedStates will be effected.The friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close neighborhoodand strengthened by many considerations of intimate intercourse andreciprocal interest, has never been more conspicuous than now nor morehopeful of increased benefit to both nations. The intercourse of the twocountries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. Theestablished lines and those recently projected add to the intimacy oftraffic and open new channels of access to fresh areas of demand andsupply. The importance of the Mexican railway system will be furtherenhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become alink in the projected intercontinental railway. I recommend that ourmission in the City of Mexico be raised to the first class.The cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that bythe continuance of methods of friendly negotiation much may be accomplishedin the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and of the increaseof our trade. The extent and development of our trade with the island ofCuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with apeculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special arrangement in regardto commerce, based upon the reciprocity provision of the recent tariff act,would operate most beneficially for both Governments. This subject is nowreceiving attention.The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded agratifying occasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whosegenius our country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbrokenfriendship which has existed between the land which bore him and our own,which claimed him as a citizen.On the 2d of September last the commission appointed to revise theproceedings of the commission under the claims convention between theUnited States and Venezuela of 1866 brought its labors to a close withinthe period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late commissionwere characterized by a spirit of impartiality and a high sense of justice,and an incident which was for many years the subject of discussion betweenthe two Governments has been disposed of in a manner alike honorable andsatisfactory to both parties. For the settlement of the claim of theVenezuela Steam Transportation Company, which was the subject of a jointresolution adopted at the last session of Congress, negotiations are stillin progress, and their early conclusion is anticipated.The legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of Congress agrowing realization of the importance of the consular service in fosteringour commercial relations abroad and in protecting the domestic revenues. Asthe scope of operations expands increased provision must be made to keep upthe essential standard of efficiency. The necessity of some adequatemeasure of supervision and inspection has been so often presented that Ineed only commend the subject to your attention.The revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year endingJune 30, 1890, were $463,963,080.55 and the total expenditures for the sameperiod were $358,618,584.52. The postal receipts have not heretofore beenincluded in the statement of these aggregates, and for the purpose ofcomparison the sum of $60,882,097.92 should be deducted from both sides ofthe account. The surplus for the year, including the amount applied to thesinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts for 1890 were$16,030,923.79 and the expenditures $15,739,871 in excess of those of 1889.The customs receipts increased $5,835,842.88 and the receipts from internalrevenue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of expenditures that for pensionswas $19,312,075.96 in excess of the preceding year.The Treasury statement for the current fiscal year, partly actual andpartly estimated, is as follows: Receipts from all sources, $406,000,000;total expenditures, $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, nottaking the postal receipts into the account on either side. The loss ofrevenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25,000,000, butfrom this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the firstfour months of the year.For the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000 and theestimated expenditures $357,852,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of$15,247,790.58, which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the beginningof the year, will give $67,247,790.58 as the sum available for theredemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receiptsand expenditures for the Post Office Department, being equal, are notincluded in this statement on either side.The act "directing the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of Treasurynotes thereon," approved July 14, 1890, has been administered by theSecretary of the Treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulationat the earliest possible dates the full monthly amounts of Treasury notescontemplated by its provisions and at the same time to give to the marketfor the silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recentdepreciation in the price of silver has been observed with regret. Therapid rise in price which anticipated and followed the passage of the actwas influenced in some degree by speculation, and the recent reaction is inpart the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetarydisturbances. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determinethe permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but itis gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act hasexerted, and will continue to exert, a most beneficial influence uponbusiness and upon general values.While it has not been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of aninternational conference looking to an agreement touching the full use ofsilver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to observeclosely any change in the situation abroad, and no favorable opportunitywill be lost to promote a result which it is confidently believed wouldconfer very large benefits upon the commerce of the world.The recent monetary disturbances in England are not unlikely to suggest areexamination of opinions upon this subject. Our very large supply of goldwill, if not lost by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest ofsilver, give us a position of advantage in promoting a permanent and safeinternational agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal.The efforts of the Secretary to increase the volume of money in circulationby keeping down the Treasury surplus to the lowest practicable limit havebeen unremitting and in a very high degree successful. The tables presentedby him showing the increase of money in circulation during the last twodecades, and especially the table showing the increase during the nineteenmonths he has administered the affairs of the Department, are interestingand instructive. The increase of money in circulation during the nineteenmonths has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per capita,and of this increase only $7,100,000 was due to the recent silverlegislation. That this substantial and needed aid given to commerceresulted in an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annualinterest charge is matter of increased satisfaction. There have beenpurchased and redeemed since March 4, 1889, 4 and 4 1\\2 per cent bonds tothe amount of $211,832,450, at a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in thereduction of the annual interest charge of $8,967,609 and a total saving ofinterest of $51,576,706.I notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that thereceipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal yearnearly $12,000,000, and that the cost of collecting this larger revenue wasless by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. Thepercentage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less for the lastfiscal year than ever before.The Customs Administration Board, provided for by the act of June 10, 1890,was selected with great care, and is composed in part of men whose previousexperience in the administration of the old customs regulations had madethem familiar with the evils to be remedied, and in part of men whose legaland judicial acquirements and experience seemed to fit them for the work ofinterpreting and applying the new statute. The chief aim of the law is tosecure honest valuations of all dutiable merchandise and to make thesevaluations uniform at all our ports of entry. It had been made manifest bya Congressional investigation that a system of undervaluation had been longin use by certain classes of importers, resulting not only in a great lossof revenue, but in a most intolerable discrimination against honesty. It isnot seen how this legislation, when it is understood, can be regarded bythe citizens of any country having commercial dealings with us asunfriendly. If any duty is supposed to be excessive, let the complaint belodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well disposed peoplethat a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of quasi smuggling.The report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying resultsattained during the year by wise and unostentatious methods. The percentageof desertions from the Army (an evil for which both Congress and theDepartment have long been seeking a remedy) has been reduced during thepast year 24 per cent, and for the months of August and September, duringwhich time the favorable effects of the act of June 16 were felt, 33 percent, as compared with the same months of 1889.The results attained by a reorganization and consolidation of the divisionshaving charge of the hospital and service records of the volunteer soldiersare very remarkable. This change was effected in July, 1889, and at thattime there were 40,654 cases awaiting attention, more than half of thesebeing calls from the Pension Office for information necessary to theadjudication of pension claims. On the 30th day of June last, though over300,000 new calls had come in, there was not a single case that had notbeen examined and answered.I concur in the recommendations of the Secretary that adequate and regularappropriations be continued for coast defense works and ordnance. Planshave been practically agreed upon, and there can be no good reason fordelaying the execution of them, while the defenseless state of our greatseaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition.The encouragement that has been extended to the militia of the States,generally and most appropriately designated the "National Guard," should becontinued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a largesense the Army of the United States, while about five sixths of the annualcost of their maintenance is defrayed by the States.The report of the Attorney General is under the law submitted directly toCongress, but as the Department of Justice is one of the ExecutiveDepartments some reference to the work done is appropriate here.A vigorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring totrial and punishment all violators of the law, but at the same time carehas been taken that frivolous and technical offenses should not be used toswell the fees of officers or to harass well disposed citizens. Especialattention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution ofviolations of the election laws and of offenses against United Statesofficers. The number of convictions secured, very many of them upon pleasof guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary restraining influence. Therehave been several cases where postmasters appointed by me have beensubjected to violent interference in the discharge of their official dutiesand to persecutions and personal violence of the most extreme character.Some of these cases have been dealt with through the Department of Justice,and in some cases the post offices have been abolished or suspended. I havedirected the Postmaster General to pursue this course in all cases whereother efforts failed to secure for any postmaster not himself in fault anopportunity peacefully to exercise the duties of his office. But suchaction will not supplant the efforts of the Department of Justice to bringthe particular offenders to punishment.The vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates ofnaturalization, upon bills in equity filed by the Attorney General in thecircuit court of the United States, is a new application of a familiarequity jurisdiction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been taken duringthe year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number of fraudulentcertificates of naturalization have been issued. And in this connection Ibeg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so amended as to require amore full and searching inquiry into all the facts necessary tonaturalization before any certificates are granted. It certainly is not toomuch to require that an application for American citizenship shall be heardwith as much care and recorded with as much formality as are given to casesinvolving the pettiest property right.At the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled "An actto prohibit bookmaking and pool selling in the District of Columbia," andstated my objection to be that it did not prohibit but in fact licensedwhat it purported to prohibit. An effort will be made under existing lawsto suppress this evil, though it is not certain that they will be foundadequate.The report of the Postmaster General shows the most gratifying progress inthe important work committed to his direction. The business methods havebeen greatly improved. A large economy in expenditures and an increase offour and three quarters millions in receipts have been realized. Thedeficiency this year is $5,786,300, as against $6,350,183 last year,notwithstanding the great enlargement of the service. Mail routes have beenextended and quickened and greater accuracy and dispatch in distributionand delivery have been attained. The report will be found to be full ofinterest and suggestion, not only to Congress, but to those thoughtfulcitizens who may be interested to know what business methods can do forthat department of public administration which most nearly touches all ourpeople.The passage of the act to amend certain sections of the Revised Statutesrelating to lotteries, approved September 19, 1890, has been received withgreat and deserved popular favor. The Post Office Department and theDepartment of Justice at once entered upon the enforcement of the law withsympathetic vigor, and already the public mails have been largely freedfrom the fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and literature emanating fromthe lottery companies.The construction and equipment of the new ships for the Navy have made verysatisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been putin commission, and during this winter four more, including one monitor,will be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized is beingpushed both in the Government and private yards with energy and watchedwith the most scrupulous care.The experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resistingpower of armor plates have been so valuable as to attract great attentionin Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships that is threatenedby unusual delay is the armor plating, and every effort is being made toreduce that to the minimum. It is a source of congratulation that theanticipated influence of these modern vessels upon the esprit de corps ofthe officers and seamen has been fully realized. Confidence and pride inthe ship among the crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Yourfavorable consideration is invited to the recommendations of theSecretary.The report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits with great fullnessand clearness the vast work of that Department and the satisfactory resultsattained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to theconsideration of Congress, though they can not all be given particularmention here.The several acts of Congress looking to the reduction of the larger Indianreservations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians upon individualallotments, and the restoration to the public domain of lands in excess oftheir needs have been largely carried into effect so far as the work wasconfided to the Executive. Agreements have been concluded since March 4,1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,726,000 acresof land. These contracts have, as required by law, been submitted toCongress for ratification and for the appropriations necessary to carrythem into effect. Those with the Sisseton and Wahpeton, Sac and Fox, Iowa,Pottawatomies and Absentee Shawnees, and Coeur d\'Alene tribes have not yetreceived the sanction of Congress. Attention is also called to the factthat the appropriations made in the case of the Sioux Indians have notcovered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. Ifan agreement is confirmed, all of its terms should be complied with withoutdelay and full appropriations should be made.The policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patentingof lands to settlers upon the public domain has been carried out in theadministration of the Land Office. No general suspicion or imputation offraud has been allowed to delay the hearing and adjudication of individualcases upon their merits. The purpose has been to perfect the title ofhonest settlers with such promptness that the value of the entry might notbe swallowed up by the expense and extortions to which delay subjected theclaimant. The average monthly issue of agricultural patents has beenincreased about 6,000.The disability pension act, which was approved on the 27th of June last,has been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increasedclerical force provided was selected and assigned to work, and aconsiderable part of the force engaged in examinations in the field wasrecalled and added to the working force of the office. The examination andadjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more rapidthan ever before. There is no economy to the Government in delay, whilethere is much hardship and injustice to the soldier. The anticipatedexpenditure, while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess ofthe estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberalenlargement of the general law should suggest a more careful scrutiny ofbills for special relief, both as to the cases where relief is granted andas to the amount allowed.The increasing numbers and influence of the non Mormon population of Utahare observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff,president of the Mormon Church, in which he advised his people "to refrainfrom contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land," hasattracted wide attention, and it is hoped that its influence will be highlybeneficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the United States. Butthe fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine or belief of the churchthat polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by divine revelationremains unchanged. President Woodruff does not renounce the doctrine, butrefrains from teaching it, and advises against the practice of it becausethe law is against it. Now, it is quite true that the law should notattempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone; but it is quite anotherthing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the Territory of Utah asthat those who believe polygamy to be rightful shall not have the power tomake it lawful.The admission of the States of Wyoming and Idaho to the Union are eventsfull of interest and congratulation, not only to the people of those Statesnow happily endowed with a full participation in our privileges andresponsibilities, but to all our people. Another belt of States stretchesfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific.The work of the Patent Office has won from all sources very highcommendation. The amount accomplished has been very largely increased, andall the results have been such as to secure confidence and considerationfor the suggestions of the Commissioner.The enumeration of the people of the United States under the provisions ofthe act of March 1, 1889, has been completed, and the result will be atonce officially communicated to Congress. The completion of this decennialenumeration devolves upon Congress the duty of making a new apportionmentof Representatives "among the several States according to their respectivenumbers."At the last session I had occasion to return with my objections severalbills making provisions for the erection of public buildings for the reasonthat the expenditures contemplated were, in my opinion, greatly in excessof any public need. No class of legislation is more liable to abuse or todegenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public Treasury than this.There should be exercised in this matter a wise economy, based upon someresponsible and impartial examination and report as to each case, under ageneral law.The report of the Secretary of Agriculture deserves especial attention inview of the fact that the year has been marked in a very unusual degree byagitation and organization among the farmers looking to an increase in theprofits of their business. It will be found that the efforts of theDepartment have been intelligently and zealously devoted to the promotionof the interests intrusted to its care.A very substantial improvement in the market prices of the leading farmproducts during the year is noticed. The price of wheat advanced from 81cents in October, 1889, to $1.00 3/4 in October, 1890; corn from 31 centsto 50 1/4 cents; oats from 19 1/4 cents to 43 cents, and barley from 63cents to 78 cents. Meats showed a substantial but not so large an increase.The export trade in live animals and fowls shows a very large increase. Thetotal value of such exports for the year ending June 30, 1890, was$33,000,000, and the increase over the preceding year was over $15,000,000.Nearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more hogs were exported than inthe preceding year. The export trade in beef and pork products and in dairyproducts was very largely increased, the increase in the article of butteralone being from 15,504,978 pounds to 29,748,042 pounds, and the totalincrease in the value of meat and dairy products exported being$34,000,000. This trade, so directly helpful to the farmer, it is believed,will be yet further and very largely increased when the system ofinspection and sanitary supervision now provided by law is brought fullyinto operation.The efforts of the Secretary to establish the healthfulness of our meatsagainst the disparaging imputations that have been put upon them abroadhave resulted in substantial progress. Veterinary surgeons sent out by theDepartment are now allowed to participate in the inspection of the livecattle from this country landed at the English docks, and during theseveral months they have been on duty no case of contagiouspleuro pneumonia has been reported. This inspection abroad and the domesticinspection of live animals and pork products provided for by the act ofAugust 30, 1890, will afford as perfect a guaranty for the wholesomeness ofour meats offered for foreign consumption as is anywhere given to any foodproduct, and its nonacceptance will quite clearly reveal the real motive ofany continued restriction of their use, and that having been made clear theduty of the Executive will be very plain.The information given by the Secretary of the progress and prospects of thebeet sugar industry is full of interest. It has already passed theexperimental stage and is a commercial success. The area over which thesugar beet can be successfully cultivated is very large, and another fieldcrop of great value is offered to the choice of the farmer.The Secretary of the Treasury concurs in the recommendation of theSecretary of Agriculture that the official supervision provided by thetariff law for sugar of domestic production shall be transferred to theDepartment of Agriculture.The law relating to the civil service has, so far as I can learn, beenexecuted by those having the power of appointment in the classified servicewith fidelity and impartiality, and the service has been increasinglysatisfactory. The report of the Commission shows a large amount of goodwork done during the year with very limited appropriations.I congratulate the Congress and the country upon the passage at the firstsession of the Fifty first Congress of an unusual number of laws of veryhigh importance. That the results of this legislation will be thequickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industries, larger andbetter markets for our breadstuffs and provisions both at home and abroad,more constant employment and better wages for our working people, and anincreased supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business, I donot doubt. Some of these measures were enacted at so late a period that thebeneficial effects upon commerce which were in the contemplation ofCongress have as yet but partially manifested themselves.The general trade and industrial conditions throughout the country duringthe year have shown a marked improvement. For many years prior to 1888 themerchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our favor, butduring that year and the year following they turned against us. It is verygratifying to know that the last fiscal year again shows a balance in ourfavor of over $68,000,000. The bank clearings, which furnish a good test ofthe volume of business transacted, for the first ten months of the year1890 show as compared with the same months of 1889 an increase for thewhole country of about 8.4 per cent, while the increase outside of the cityof New York was over 13 per cent. During the month of October the clearingsof the whole country showed an increase of 3.1 per cent over October, 1889,while outside of New York the increase was 11.5 per cent. These figuresshow that the increase in the volume of business was very generalthroughout the country. That this larger business was being conducted upona safe and profitable basis is shown by the fact that there were 300 lessfailures reported in October, 1890, than in the same month of the precedingyear, with liabilities diminished by about $5,000,000.The value of our exports of domestic merchandise during the last year wasover $115,000,000 greater than the preceding year, and was only exceededonce in our history. About $100,000,000 of this excess was in agriculturalproducts. The production of pig iron, always a good gauge of generalprosperity, is shown by a recent census bulletin to have been 153 per centgreater in 1890 than in 1880, and the production of steel 290 per centgreater. Mining in coal has had no limitation except that resulting fromdeficient transportation. The general testimony is that labor is everywherefully employed, and the reports for the last year show a smaller number ofemployees affected by strikes and lockouts than in any year since 1884. Thedepression in the prices of agricultural products had been greatly relievedand a buoyant and hopeful tone was beginning to be felt by all our people.These promising influences have been in some degree checked by thesurprising and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently takenplace in England. It is gratifying to know that these did not grow in anydegree out of the financial relations of London with our people or out ofany discredit attached to our securities held in that market. The return ofour bonds and stocks was caused by a money stringency in England, not byany loss of value or credit in the securities themselves. We could not,however, wholly escape the ill effects of a foreign monetary agitationaccompanied by such extraordinary incidents as characterized this. It isnot believed, however, that these evil incidents, which have for the timeunfavorably affected values in this country, can long withstand the strong,safe, and wholesome influences which are operating to give to our peopleprofitable returns in all branches of legitimate trade and industry. Theapprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subjected toimportant general changes would undoubtedly add a depressing influence ofthe most serious character.The general tariff act has only partially gone into operation, some of itsimportant provisions being limited to take effect at dates yet in thefuture. The general provisions of the law have been in force less thansixty days. Its permanent effects upon trade and prices still largely standin conjecture. It is curious to note that the advance in the prices ofarticles wholly unaffected by the tariff act was by many hastily ascribedto that act. Notice was not taken of the fact that the general tendency ofthe markets was upward, from influences wholly apart from the recent tarifflegislation. The enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedlygave an upward tendency to trade and had a marked effect on prices; butthis natural and desired effect of the silver legislation was by manyerroneously attributed to the tariff act.There is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject oftariff revision shall be again opened before this law has had a fair trial.It is quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections. Nobill was ever framed, I suppose, that in all of its rates andclassifications had the full approval even of a party caucus. Suchlegislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise as todetails, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope andeffect I think it will justify the support of those who believe thatAmerican legislation should conserve and defend American trade and thewages of American workmen.The misinformation as to the terms of the act which has been so widelydisseminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience, and theevil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, thesavings banks, international trade balances, and the general prosperity ofour people. Already we begin to hear from abroad and from our customhousesthat the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the act is notjustified. The imports at the port of New York for the first three weeks ofNovember were nearly 8 per cent greater than for the same period in 1889and 29 per cent greater than in the same period of 1888. And so far frombeing an act to limit exports, I confidently believe that under it we shallsecure a larger and more profitable participation in foreign trade than wehave ever enjoyed, and that we shall recover a proportionate participationin the ocean carrying trade of the world.The criticisms of the bill that have come to us from foreign sources maywell be rejected for repugnancy. If these critics really believe that theadoption by us of a free trade policy, or of tariff rates having referencesolely to revenue, would diminish the participation of their own countriesin the commerce of the world, their advocacy and promotion, by speech andother forms of organized effort, of this movement among our people is arare exhibition of unselfishness in trade. And, on the other hand, if theysincerely believe that the adoption of a protective tariff policy by thiscountry inures to their profit and our hurt, it is noticeably strange thatthey should lead the outcry against the authors of a policy so helpful totheir countrymen and crown with their favor those who would snatch fromthem a substantial share of a trade with other lands already inadequate totheir necessities.There is no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory orretaliatory legislation. Our policies are adopted not to the hurt ofothers, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow outof our favored position as a nation. Our form of government, with itsincident of universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall save ourworking people from the agitations and distresses which scant work andwages that have no margin for comfort always beget. But after all this isdone it will be found that our markets are open to friendly commercialexchanges of enormous value to the other great powers.From the time of my induction into office the duty of using every power andinfluence given by law to the executive department for the development oflarger markets for our products, especially our farm products, has beenkept constantly in mind, and no effort has been or will be spared topromote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market,except that we pay our workmen and workwomen better wages than are paidelsewhere better abstractly, better relatively to the cost of thenecessaries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely increased foreigntrade is accessible to us without bartering for it either our home marketfor such products of the farm and shop as our own people can supply or thewages of our working people.In many of the products of wood and iron and in meats and breadstuffs wehave advantages that only need better facilities of intercourse andtransportation to secure for them large foreign markets. The reciprocityclause of the tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure alarge reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our ports ofcertain products. The right of independent nations to make specialreciprocal trade concessions is well established, and does not impaireither the comity due to other powers or what is known as the"favored nation clause," so generally found in commercial treaties. What isgiven to one for an adequate agreed consideration can not be claimed byanother freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could dispensewith any import duties upon coffee, tea, hides, and the lower grades ofsugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the countriesproducing and exporting these articles by placing them on the free listentitled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs concessions uponarticles exported by us to them was so obvious that to have gratuitouslyabandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have been anunpardonable error.There were but two methods of maintaining control of this question open toCongress to place all of these articles upon the dutiable list, subject tosuch treaty agreements as could be secured, or to place them all presentlyupon the free list, but subject to the reimposition of specified duties ifthe countries from which we received them should refuse to give to ussuitable reciprocal benefits. This latter method, I think, possesses greatadvantages. It expresses in advance the consent of Congress to reciprocityarrangements affecting these products, which must otherwise have beendelayed and unascertained until each treaty was ratified by the Senate andthe necessary legislation enacted by Congress. Experience has shown thatsome treaties looking to reciprocal trade have failed to secure atwo thirds vote in the Senate for ratification, and others having passedthat stage have for years awaited the concurrence of the House and Senatein such modifications of our revenue laws as were necessary to give effectto their provisions. We now have the concurrence of both Houses in advancein a distinct and definite offer of free entry to our ports of specificarticles. The Executive is not required to deal in conjecture as to whatCongress will accept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than anoffer. Our part of the bargain is complete; delivery has been made; andwhen the countries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea, and hides haveplaced on their free lists such of our products as shall be agreed upon asan equivalent for our concession, a proclamation of that fact completes thetransaction; and in the meantime our own people have free sugar, tea,coffee, and hides.The indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorableaction by the countries from which we receive our large imports of coffeeand sugar, and it is confidently believed that if steam communication withthese countries can be promptly improved and enlarged the next year willshow a most gratifying increase in our exports of breadstuffs andprovisions, as well as of some important lines of manufactured goods.In addition to the important bills that became laws before the adjournmentof the last session, some other bills of the highest importance were welladvanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the calendars of the twoHouses in favored positions. The present session has a fixed limit, and ifthese measures are not now brought to a final vote all the work that hasbeen done upon them by this Congress is lost. The proper consideration ofthese, of an apportionment bill, and of the annual appropriation bills willrequire not only that no working day of the session shall be lost, but thatmeasures of minor and local interest shall not be allowed to interrupt orretard the progress of those that are of universal interest. In view ofthese conditions, I refrain from bringing before you at this time somesuggestions that would otherwise be made, and most earnestly invoke yourattention to the duty of perfecting the important legislation now welladvanced. To some of these measures, which seem to me most important, I nowbriefly call your attention.I desire to repeat with added urgency the recommendations contained in mylast annual message in relation to the development of American steamshiplines. The reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be largely limitedand its benefits retarded and diminished if provision is notcontemporaneously made to encourage the establishment of first class steamcommunication between our ports and the ports of such nations as may meetour overtures for enlarged commercial exchanges. The steamship, carryingthe mails statedly and frequently and offering to passengers a comfortable,safe, and speedy transit, is the first condition of foreign trade. Itcarries the order or the buyer, but not all that is ordered or bought. Itgives to the sailing vessels such cargoes as are not urgent or perishable,and, indirectly at least, promotes that important adjunct of commerce.There is now both in this country and in the nations of Central and SouthAmerica a state of expectation and confidence as to increased trade thatwill give a double value to your prompt action upon this question.The present situation of our mail communication with Australia illustratesthe importance of early action by Congress. The Oceanic Steamship Companymaintains a line of steamers between San Francisco, Sydney, and Aucklandconsisting of three vessels, two of which are of United States registry andone of foreign registry. For the service done by this line in carrying themails we pay annually the sum of $46,000, being, as estimated, the full seaand United States inland postage, which is the limit fixed by law. Thecolonies of New South Wales and New Zealand have been paying annually tothese lines lbs. 37,000 for carrying the mails from Sydney and Auckland toSan Francisco. The contract under which this payment has been made is nowabout to expire, and those colonies have refused to renew the contractunless the United States shall pay a more equitable proportion of the wholesum necessary to maintain the service.I am advised by the Postmaster General that the United States receives forcarrying the Australian mails, brought to San Francisco in these steamers,by rail to Vancouver, an estimated annual income of $75,000, while, as Ihave stated, we are paying out for the support of the steamship line thatbrings this mail to us only $46,000, leaving an annual surplus resultingfrom this service of $29,000. The trade of the United States withAustralia, which is in a considerable part carried by these steamers, andthe whole of which is practically dependent upon the mail communicationwhich they maintain, is largely in our favor. Our total exports ofmerchandise to Australasian ports during the fiscal year ending June 30,1890, were $11,266,484, while the total imports of merchandise from theseports were only $4,277,676. If we are not willing to see this importantsteamship line withdrawn, or continued with Vancouver substituted for SanFrancisco as the American terminal, Congress should put it in the power ofthe Postmaster General to make a liberal increase in the amount now paidfor the transportation of this important mail.The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position toward thenew and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff actand the postal shipping bill are designed to promote. Steamship lines fromthese ports to some northern port of South America will almost certainlyeffect a connection between the railroad systems of the continents longbefore any continuous line of railroads can be put into operation. The verylarge appropriation made at the last session for the harbor of Galvestonwas justified, as it seemed to me, by these considerations. The greatNorthwest will feel the advantage of trunk lines to the South as well as tothe East and of the new markets opened for their surplus food products andfor many of their manufactured products.I had occasion in May last to transmit to Congress a report adopted by theInternational American Conference upon the subject of the incorporation ofan international American bank, with a view to facilitating money exchangesbetween the States represented in that conference. Such an institutionwould greatly promote the trade we are seeking to develop. I renew therecommendation that a careful and well guarded charter be granted. I do notthink the powers granted should include those ordinarily exercised bytrust, guaranty, and safe deposit companies, or that more branches in theUnited States should be authorized than are strictly necessary toaccomplish the object primarily in view, namely, convenient foreignexchanges. It is quite important that prompt action should be taken in thismatter, in order that any appropriations for better communication withthese countries and any agreements that may be made for reciprocal trademay not be hindered by the inconvenience of making exchanges throughEuropean money centers or burdened by the tribute which is an incident ofthat method of business.The bill for the relief of the Supreme Court has after many years ofdiscussion reached a position where final action is easily attainable, andit is hoped that any differences of opinion may be so harmonized as to savethe essential features of this very important measure. In this connection Iearnestly renew my recommendation that the salaries of the judges of theUnited States district courts be so readjusted that none of them shallreceive less than $5,000 per annum.The subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and theurgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial ofquestions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to theattention of Congress at the last session. Bills have been reported fromthe proper committees in both Houses upon the subject, and I very earnestlyhope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which has attended thesettlement of the disputes as to the title between the settlers and theclaimants under these grants. These disputes retard the prosperity anddisturb the peace of large and important communities. The governor of NewMexico in his last report to the Secretary of the Interior suggests somemodifications of the provisions of the pending bills relating to the smallholdings of farm lands. I commend to your attention the suggestions of theSecretary of the Interior upon this subject.The enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very desirable.The Constitution having given to Congress jurisdiction of this subject, itshould be exercised and uniform rules provided for the administration ofthe affairs of insolvent debtors. The inconveniences resulting from theoccasional and temporary exercise of this power by Congress and from theconflicting State codes of insolvency which come into force intermediatelyshould be removed by the enactment of a simple, inexpensive, and permanentnational bankrupt law.I also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation affording justcopyright protection to foreign authors on a footing of reciprocaladvantage for our authors abroad.It may still be possible for this Congress to inaugurate by suitablelegislation a movement looking to uniformity and increased safety in theuse of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstatecommerce. The chief difficulty in the way is to secure agreement as to thebest appliances, simplicity, effectiveness, and cost being considered. Thisdifficulty will only yield to legislation, which should be based upon fullinquiry and impartial tests. The purpose should be to secure thecooperation of all well disposed managers and owners; but the fearful factthat every year\'s delay involves the sacrifice of 2,000 lives and themaiming of 20,000 young men should plead both with Congress and themanagers against any needless delay.The subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water supplyof the arid regions has had much attention from Congress, but has not asyet been put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis. The urgency of thesubject does not grow out of any large present demand for the use of theselands for agriculture, but out of the danger that the water supply and thesites for the necessary catch basins may fall into the hands of individualsor private corporations and be used to render subservient the large areasdependent upon such supply. The owner of the water is the owner of thelands, however the titles may run. All unappropriated natural water sourcesand all necessary reservoir sites should be held by the Government for theequal use at fair rates of the homestead settlers who will eventually takeup these lands. The United States should not, in my opinion, undertake theconstruction of dams or canals, but should limit its work to such surveysand observations as will determine the water supply, both surface andsubterranean, the areas capable of irrigation, and the location and storagecapacity of reservoirs. This done, the use of the water and of thereservoir sites might be granted to the respective States or Territories orto individuals or associations upon the condition that the necessary worksshould be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates withoutdiscrimination, the rates to be subject to supervision by the legislaturesor by boards of water commissioners duly constituted. The essential thingto be secured is the common and equal use at fair rates of the accumulatedwater supply. It were almost better that these lands should remain aridthan that those who occupy them should become the slaves of unrestrainedmonopolies controlling the one essential element of land values and cropresults.The use of the telegraph by the Post Office Department as a means for therapid transmission of written communications is, I believe, upon properterms, quite desirable. The Government does not own or operate therailroads, and it should not, I think, own or operate the telegraph lines.It does, however, seem to be quite practicable for the Government tocontract with the telegraph companies, as it does with railroad companies,to carry at specified rates such communications as the senders maydesignate for this method of transmission. I recommend that suchlegislation be enacted as will enable the Post Office Department fairly totest by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph.If any intelligent and loyal company of American citizens were required tocatalogue the essential human conditions of national life, I do not doubtthat with absolute unanimity they would begin with "free and honestelections." And it is gratifying to know that generally there is a growingand nonpartisan demand for better election laws; but against this sign ofhope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact thatelection laws and methods are sometimes cunningly contrived to secureminority control, while violence completes the shortcomings of fraud.In my last annual message I suggested that the development of the existinglaw providing a Federal supervision of Congressional elections offered aneffective method of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law hasmanifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesomerestraints and penalties will be useful in all. The constitutionality ofsuch legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its probableeffectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is madeto it. It has been denounced as if it were a new exercise of Federal powerand an invasion of the rights of States. Nothing could be further from thetruth. Congress has already fixed the time for the election of members ofCongress. It has declared that votes for members of Congress must be bywritten or printed ballot; it has provided for the appointment by thecircuit courts in certain cases, and upon the petition of a certain numberof citizens, of election supervisors, and made it their duty to supervisethe registration of voters conducted by the State officers; to challengepersons offering to register; to personally inspect and scrutinize theregistry lists, and to affix their names to the lists for the purpose ofidentification and the prevention of frauds; to attend at elections andremain with the boxes till they are all cast and counted; to attach to theregistry lists and election returns any statement touching the accuracy andfairness of the registry and election, and to take and transmit to theClerk of the House of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent practiceswhich may be presented to them. The same law provides for the appointmentof deputy United States marshals to attend at the polls, support thesupervisors in the discharge of their duties, and to arrest personsviolating the election laws. The provisions of this familiar title of theRevised Statutes have been put into exercise by both the great politicalparties, and in the North as well as in the South, by the filing with thecourt of the petitions required by the law.It is not, therefore, a question whether we shall have a Federal electionlaw, for we now have one and have had for nearly twenty years, but whetherwe shall have an effective law. The present law stops just short ofeffectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all control overthe certification which establishes the prima facie right to a seat in theHouse of Representatives. This defect should be cured. Equality ofrepresentation and the parity of the electors must be maintained oreverything that is valuable in our system of government is lost. Thequalifications of an elector must be sought in the law, net in theopinions, prejudices, or fears of any class, however powerful. The path ofthe elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and theenticements of fraud; the count so true and open that none shall gainsayit. Such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial. It shouldgive the advantage to honesty and the control to majorities. Surely thereis nothing sectional about this creed, and if it shall happen that thepenalties of laws intended to enforce these rights fall here and not thereit is not because the law is sectional, but because, happily, crime islocal and not universal. Nor should it be forgotten that every law, whetherrelating to elections or to any other subject, whether enacted by the Stateor by the nation, has force behind it; the courts, the marshal orconstable, the posse comitatus, the prison, are all and always behind thelaw.One can not be justly charged with unfriendliness to any section or classwho seeks only to restrain violations of law and of personal right. Nocommunity will find lawlessness profitable. No community can afford to haveit known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of thepublic peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves theproduct of fraud or violence. The magistrate is then without respect andthe law without sanction. The floods of lawlessness can not be leveed andmade to run in one channel. The killing of a United States marshal carryinga writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting andsuggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime againstlife or property.But it is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and somehave even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are madeimpossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence. If theproposed law gives to any qualified elector by a hair\'s weight more thanhis equal influence or detracts by so much from any other qualifiedelector, it is fatally impeached. But if the law is equal and theanimosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors havebeen accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as forthemselves, then these animosities ought not to be confessed without shame,and can not be given any weight in the discussion without dishonor Nochoice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secureto the citizen his constitutional rights and to recommend that theinadequacies of such laws be promptly remedied. If to promote with zeal andready interest every project for the development of its material interests,its rivers, harbors, mines, and factories, and the intelligence, peace, andsecurity under the law of its communities and its homes is not accepted assufficient evidence of friendliness to any State or section, I can not addconnivance at election practices that not only disturb local results, butrob the electors of other States and sections of their most pricelesspolitical rights.The preparation of the general appropriation bills should be conducted withthe greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appropriationsshould be adequate to the needs of the public service, but they should beabsolutely free from prodigality.I venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining for theconsideration of the important legislation now awaiting your attentionoffers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged withdiligence, fidelity, and courage, the work of the Fifty first Congress maybe confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people.
Benjamin Harrison
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments required bylaw to be submitted to me, which are herewith transmitted, and the reportsof the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, made directly toCongress, furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative work of thelast fiscal year relating to internal affair. It would be of greatadvantage if these reports could have an alternative perusal by everymember of Congress and by all who take an interest in public affairs. Sucha perusal could not fail to excite a higher appreciation of the vast laborand conscientious effort which are given to the conduct of our civiladministration.The reports will, I believe, show that every question has been approached,considered, and decided from the standpoint of public duty uponconsiderations affecting the public interests alone. Again I invite toevery branch of the service the attention and scrutiny of Congress.The work of the State Department during the last year has beencharacterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and bydiplomatic results of a notable and highly beneficial character. Amongthese are the reciprocal trade arrangements which have been concluded, inthe exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the tariff law, withthe Republic of Brazil, with Spain for its West India possessions, and withSanto Domingo. Like negotiations with other countries have been muchadvanced, and it is hoped that before the close of the year furtherdefinitive trade arrangements of great value will be concluded.In view of the reports which had been received as to the diminution of theseal herds in the Bering Sea, I deemed it wise to propose to Her Majesty\'sGovernment in February last that an agreement for a closed season should bemade pending the negotiations for arbitration, which then seemed to beapproaching a favorable conclusion. After much correspondence and delays,for which this Government was not responsible, an agreement was reached andsigned on the 15th of June, by which Great Britain undertook from that dateand until May 1, 1892, to prohibit the killing by her subjects of seals inthe Bering Sea, and the Government of the United States during the sameperiod to enforce its existing prohibition against pelagic sealing and tolimit the catch by the fur seal company upon the islands to 7,500 skins. Ifthis agreement could have been reached earlier in response to the strenuousendeavors of this Government, it would have been more effective; but comingeven as late as it did it unquestionably resulted in greatly diminishingthe destruction of the seals by the Canadian sealers.In my last annual message I stated that the basis of arbitration proposedby Her Majesty\'s Government for the adjustment of the long pendingcontroversy as to the seal fisheries was not acceptable. I am glad now tobe able to announce that terms satisfactory to this Government have beenagreed upon and that an agreement as to the arbitrators is all that isnecessary to the completion of the convention. In view of the advancedposition which this Government has taken upon the subject of internationalarbitration, this renewed expression of our adherence to this method forthe settlement of disputes such as have arisen in the Bering Sea will, Idoubt not, meet with the concurrence of Congress.Provision should be made for a joint demarcation of the frontier linebetween Canada and the United States wherever required by the increasingborder settlements, and especially for the exact location of the waterboundary in the straits and rivers.I should have been glad to announce some favorable disposition of theboundary dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela touching the westernfrontier of British Guiana, but the friendly efforts of the United Statesin that direction have thus far been unavailing. This Government willcontinue to express its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachmenton territories long under the administrative control of American States.The determination of a disputed boundary is easily attainable by amicablearbitration where the rights of the respective parties rest, as here, onhistoric facts readily ascertainable.The law of the last Congress providing a system of inspection for our meatsintended for export, and clothing the President with power to excludeforeign products from our market in case the country sending them shouldperpetuate unjust discriminations against any product of the United States,placed this Government in a position to effectively urge the removal ofsuch discriminations against our meats. It is gratifying to be able tostate that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria, and France, in the ordernamed, have opened their ports to inspected American pork products. Theremoval of these restrictions in every instance was asked for and givensolely upon the ground that we have now provided a meat inspection thatshould be accepted as adequate to the complete removal of the dangers, realor fancied, which had been previously urged. The State Department, ourministers abroad, and the Secretary of Agriculture have cooperated withunflagging and intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this greatresult. The outlines of an agreement have been reached with Germany lookingto equitable trade concessions in consideration of the continued freeimportation of her sugars, but the time has not yet arrived when thiscorrespondence can be submitted to Congress.The recent political disturbances in the Republic of Brazil have excitedregret and solicitude. The information we possessed was too meager toenable us to form a satisfactory judgment of the causes leading to thetemporary assumption of supreme power by President Fonseca; but thisGovernment did not fail to express to him its anxious solicitude for thepeace of Brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institutionswhich had recently been established there, nor to offer our advice thatgreat moderation should be observed in the clash of parties and the contestfor leadership. These counsels were received in the most friendly spirit,and the latest information is that constitutional government has beenreestablished without bloodshed.The lynching at New Orleans in March last of eleven men of Italian nativityby a mob of citizens was a most deplorable and discreditable incident. Itdid not, however, have its origin in any general animosity to the Italianpeople, nor in any disrespect to the Government of Italy, with which ourrelations were of the most friendly character. The fury of the mob wasdirected against these men as the supposed participants or accessories inthe murder of a city officer. I do not allude to this as mitigating in anydegree this offense against law and humanity, but only as affecting theinternational questions which grew out of it. It was at once represented bythe Italian minister that several of those whose lives had been taken bythe mob were Italian subjects, and a demand was made for the punishment ofthe participants and for an indemnity to the families of those who werekilled. It is to be regretted that the manner in which these claims werepresented was not such as to promote a calm discussion of the questionsinvolved; but this may well be attributed to the excitement and indignationwhich the crime naturally evoked. The views of this Government as to itsobligations to foreigners domiciled here were fully stated in thecorrespondence, as well as its purpose to make an investigation of theaffair with a view to determine whether there were present anycircumstances that could under such rules of duty as we had indicatedcreate an obligation upon the United States. The temporary absence of aminister plenipotentiary of Italy at this capital has retarded the furthercorrespondence, but it is not doubted that a friendly conclusion isattainable.Some suggestions growing out of this unhappy incident are worthy theattention of Congress. It would, I believe, be entirely competent forCongress to make offenses against the treaty rights of foreigners domiciledin the United States cognizable in the Federal courts. This has not,however, been done, and the Federal officers and courts have no power insuch cases to intervene, either for the protection of a foreign citizen orfor the punishment of his slayers. It seems to me to follow, in this stateof the law, that the officers of the State charged with police and judicialpowers in such cases must in the consideration of international questionsgrowing out of such incidents be regarded in such sense as Federal agentsas to make this Government answerable for their acts in cases where itwould be answerable if the United States had used its constitutional powerto define and punish crime against treaty rights.The civil war in Chile, which began in January last, was continued, butfortunately with infrequent and not important armed collisions, untilAugust 28, when the Congressional forces landed near Valparaiso and after abloody engagement captured that city. President Balmaceda at oncerecognized that his cause was lost, and a Provisional Government wasspeedily established by the victorious party. Our minister was promptlydirected to recognize and put himself in communication with this Governmentso soon as it should have established its de facto character, which wasdone. During the pendency of this civil contest frequent indirect appealswere made to this Government to extend belligerent rights to the insurgentsand to give audience to their representatives. This was declined, and thatpolicy was pursued throughout which this Government when wrenched by civilwar so strenuously insisted upon on the part of European nations. TheItata, an armed vessel commanded by a naval officer of the insurgent fleet,manned by its sailors and with soldiers on board, was seized under processof the United States court at San Diego, Cal., for a violation of ourneutrality laws. While in the custody of an officer of the court the vesselwas forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It would have beeninconsistent with the dignity and self respect of this Government not tohave insisted that the Itala should be returned to San Diego to abide thejudgment of the court. This was so clear to the junta of the Congressionalparty, established at Iquique, that before the arrival of the Itata at thatport the secretary of foreign relations of the Provisional Governmentaddressed to Rear Admiral Brown, commanding the United States naval forces,a communication, from which the following is an extract: The ProvisionalGovernment has learned by the cablegrams of the Associated Press that thetransport Itata, detained in San Diego by order of the United States fortaking on board munitions of war, and in possession of the marshal, leftthe port, carrying on board this official, who was landed at a point nearthe coast, and then continued her voyage. If this news be correct thisGovernment would deplore the conduct of the Itata, and as an evidence thatit is not disposed to support or agree to the infraction of the laws of theUnited States the undersigned takes advantage of the personal relations youhave been good enough to maintain with him since your arrival in this portto declare to you that as soon as she is within reach of our orders hisGovernment will put the Itata, with the arms and munitions she took onboard in Sail Diego, at the disposition of the United States. A trial inthe district court of the United States for the southern district ofCalifornia has recently resulted in a decision holding, among other things,that inasmuch as the Congressional party had not been recognized as abelligerent the acts done in its interest could not be a violation of ourneutrality laws. From this judgment the United States has appealed, notthat the condemnation of the vessel is a matter of importance, but that wemay know what the present state of our law is; for if this construction ofthe statute is correct there is obvious necessity for revision andamendment.During the progress of the war in Chile this Government tendered its goodoffices to bring about a peaceful adjustment, and it was at one time hopedthat a good result might be reached; but in this we were disappointed.The instructions to our naval officers and to our minister at Santiago fromthe first to the last of this struggle enjoined upon them the mostimpartial treatment and absolute noninterference. I am satisfied that theseinstructions were observed and that our representatives were alwayswatchful to use their influence impartially in the interest of humanity,and on more than one occasion did so effectively. We could not forget,however, that this Government was in diplomatic relations with the thenestablished Government of Chile, as it is now in such relations with thesuccessor of that Government. I am quite sure that President Montt, whohas, under circumstances of promise for the peace of Chile, been installedas President of that Republic, will not desire that in the unfortunateevent of any revolt against his authority the policy of this Governmentshould be other than that which we have recently observed. No officialcomplaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval officers duringthe struggle has been presented to this Government, and it is a matter ofregret that so many of our own people should have given ear to unofficialcharges and complaints that manifestly had their origin in rival interestsand in a wish to pervert the relations of the United States with Chile.The collapse of the Government of Balmaceda brought about a condition whichis unfortunately too familiar in the history of the Central and SouthAmerican States. With the overthrow of the Balmaceda Government he and manyof his councilors and officers became at once fugitives for their lives andappealed to the commanding officers of the foreign naval vessels in theharbor of Valparaiso and to the resident foreign ministers at Santiago forasylum. This asylum was freely given, according to my information, by thenaval vessels of several foreign powers and by several of the legations atSantiago. The American minister as well as his colleagues, acting upon theimpulse of humanity, extended asylum to political refugees whose lives werein peril. I have not been willing to direct the surrender of such of thesepersons as are still in the American legation without suitable conditions.It is believed that the Government of Chile is not in a position, in viewof the precedents with which it has been connected, to broadly deny theright of asylum, and the correspondence has not thus far presented any suchdenial. The treatment of our minister for a time was such as to call for adecided protest, and it was very gratifying to observe that unfriendlymeasures, which were undoubtedly the result of the prevailing excitement,were at once rescinded or suitably relaxed.On the 16th of October an event occurred in Valparaiso so serious andtragic in its circumstances and results as to very justly excite theindignation of our people and to call for prompt and decided action on thepart of this Government. A considerable number of the sailors of the UnitedStates steamship Baltimore, then in the harbor at Valparaiso, being uponshore leave and unarmed, were assaulted by armed men nearly simultaneouslyin different localities in the city. One petty officer was killed outrightand seven or eight seamen were seriously wounded, one of whom has sincedied. So savage and brutal was the assault that several of our sailorsreceived more than two and one as many as eighteen stab wounds. Aninvestigation of the affair was promptly made by a board of officers of theBaltimore, and their report shows that these assaults were unprovoked, thatour men were conducting themselves in a peaceable and orderly manner, andthat some of the police of the city took part in the assault and used theirweapons with fatal effect, while a few others, with some well disposedcitizens, endeavored to protect our men. Thirty six of our sailors werearrested, and some of them while being taken to prison were cruelly beatenand maltreated. The fact that they were all discharged, no criminal chargebeing lodged against any one of them, shows very clearly that they wereinnocent of any breach of the peace.So far as I have yet been able to learn no other explanation of this bloodywork has been suggested than that it had its origin in hostility to thosemen as sailors of the United States, wearing the uniform of theirGovernment, and not in any individual act or personal animosity. Theattention of the Chilean Government was at once called to this affair, anda statement of the facts obtained by the investigation we had conducted wassubmitted, accompanied by a request to be advised of any other orqualifying facts in the possession of the Chilean Government that mighttend to relieve this affair of the appearance of an insult to thisGovernment. The Chilean Government was also advised that if such qualifyingfacts did not exist this Government would confidently expect full andprompt reparation.It is to be regretted that the reply of the secretary for foreign affairsof the Provisional Government was couched in an offensive tone. To this noresponse has been made. This Government is now awaiting the result of aninvestigation which has been conducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso.It is reported unofficially that the investigation is about completed, andit is expected that the result will soon be communicated to thisGovernment, together with some adequate and satisfactory response to thenote by which the attention of Chile was called to this incident. If thesejust expectations should be disappointed or further needless delayintervene, I will by a special message bring this matter again to theattention of Congress for such action as may be necessary. The entirecorrespondence with the Government of Chile will at an early day besubmitted to Congress.I renew the recommendation of my special message dated January 16, 1890,for the adoption of the necessary legislation to enable this Government toapply in the case of Sweden and Norway the same rule in respect to thelevying of tonnage dues as was claimed and secured to the shipping of theUnited States in 1828 under Article VIII of the treaty of 1827.The adjournment of the Senate without action on the pending acts for thesuppression of the slave traffic in Africa and for the reform of therevenue tariff of the Independent State of the Kongo left this Governmentunable to exchange those acts on the date fixed, July 2, 1891. A modusvivendi has been concluded by which the power of the Kongo State to levyduties on imports is left unimpaired, and by agreement of all thesignatories to the general slave trade act the time for the exchange ofratifications on the part of the United States has been extended toFebruary 2, 1892.The late outbreak against foreigners in various parts of the Chinese Empirehas been a cause of deep concern in view of the numerous establishments ofour citizens in the interior of that country. This Government can do noless than insist upon a continuance of the protective and punitory measureswhich the Chinese Government has heretofore applied. No effort will beomitted to protect our citizens peaceably sojourning in China, but recentunofficial information indicates that what was at first regarded as anoutbreak of mob violence against foreigners has assumed the larger form ofan insurrection against public order.The Chinese Government has declined to receive Mr. Blair as the minister ofthe United States on the ground that as a participant while a Senator inthe enactment of the existing legislation against the introduction ofChinese laborers he has become unfriendly and objectionable to China. Ihave felt constrained to point out to the Chinese Government theuntenableness of this position, which seems to rest as much on theunacceptability of our legislation as on that of the person chosen, andwhich if admitted would practically debar the selection of anyrepresentative so long as the existing laws remain in force.You will be called upon to consider the expediency of making specialprovision by law for the temporary admission of some Chinese artisans andlaborers in connection with the exhibit of Chinese industries at theapproaching Columbian Exposition. I regard it as desirable that the Chineseexhibit be facilitated in every proper way.A question has arisen with the Government of Spain touching the rights ofAmerican citizens in the Caroline Islands. Our citizens there long prior tothe confirmation of Spain\'s claim to the islands had secured by settlementand purchase certain rights to the recognition and maintenance of which thefaith of Spain was pledged. I have had reason within the past year verystrongly to protest against the failure to carry out this pledge on thepart of His Majesty\'s ministers, which has resulted in great injustice andinjury to the American residents.The Government and people of Spain propose to celebrate the four hundredthanniversary of the discovery of America by holding an exposition at Madrid,which will open on the 12th of September and continue until the 31st ofDecember, 1892. A cordial invitation has been extended to the United Statesto take part in this commemoration, and as Spain was one of the firstnations to express the intention to participate in the World\'s ColumbianExposition at Chicago, it would be very appropriate for this Government togive this invitation its friendly promotion.Surveys for the connecting links of the projected intercontinental railwayare in progress, not only in Mexico, but at various points along the coursemapped out. Three surveying parties are now in the field under thedirection of the commission. Nearly 1,000 miles of the proposed road havebeen surveyed, including the most difficult part, that through Ecuador andthe southern part of Colombia. The reports of the engineers are verysatisfactory, and show that no insurmountable obstacles have been metwith.On November 12, 1884, a treaty was concluded with Mexico reaffirming theboundary between the two countries as described in the treaties of February2, 1848, and December 30, 1853. March 1, 1889, a further treaty wasnegotiated to facilitate the carrying out of the principles of the treatyof 1884 and to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the changesand alterations that take place from natural causes in the Rio Grande andColorado rivers in the portions thereof constituting the boundary linebetween the two Republics. The International Boundary Commission providedfor by the treaty of 1889 to have exclusive jurisdiction of any questionthat may arise has been named by the Mexican Government. An appropriationis necessary to enable the United States to fulfill its treaty obligationsin this respect.The death of King Kalakaua in the United States afforded occasion totestify our friendship for Hawaii by conveying the King\'s body to his ownland in a naval vessel with all due honors. The Government of hissuccessor, Queen Liliuokolani is seeking to promote closer commercialrelations with the United States. Surveys for the much needed submarinecable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu are in progress, and thisenterprise should have the suitable promotion of the two Governments. Istrongly recommend that provision be made for improving the harbor of PearlRiver and equipping it as a naval station.The arbitration treaty formulated by the International American Conferencelapsed by reason of the failure to exchange ratifications fully within thelimit of time provided; but several of the Governments concerned haveexpressed a desire to save this important result of the conference by anextension of the period. It is, in my judgment, incumbent upon the UnitedStates to conserve the influential initiative it has taken in this measureby ratifying the instrument and by advocating the proposed extension of thetime for exchange. These views have been made known to the othersignatories.This Government has found occasion to express in a friendly spirit, butwith much earnestness, to the Government of the Czar its serious concernbecause of the harsh measures now being enforced against the Hebrews inRussia. By the revival of antisemitic laws, long in abeyance, great numbersof those unfortunate people have been constrained to abandon their homesand leave the Empire by reason of the impossibility of finding subsistencewithin the pale to which it is sought to confine them. The immigration ofthese people to the United States many other countries being closed tothem is largely increasing and is likely to assume proportions which maymake it difficult to find homes and employment for them here and toseriously affect the labor market. It is estimated that over 1,000,000 willbe forced from Russia within a few years. The Hebrew is never a beggar; hehas always kept the law life by toil often under severe and oppressivecivil restrictions. It is also true that no race, sect, or class has morefully cared for its own than the Hebrew race. But the sudden transfer ofsuch a multitude under conditions that tend to strip them of their smallaccumulations and to depress their energies and courage is neither good forthem nor for us.The banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less certain indirectmethods, of so large a number of men and women is not a local question. Adecree to leave one country is in the nature of things an order to enteranother some other. This consideration, as well as the suggestion ofhumanity, furnishes ample ground for the remonstrances which we havepresented to Russia, while our historic friendship for that Government cannot fail to give the assurance that our representations are those of asincere wellwisher.The annual report of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua shows thatmuch costly and necessary preparatory work has been done during the year inthe construction of shops, railroad tracks, and harbor piers andbreakwaters, and that the work of canal construction has made someprogress.I deem it to be a matter of the highest concern to the United States thatthis canal, connecting the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans andgiving to us a short water communication between our ports upon those twogreat seas, should be speedily constructed and at the smallest practicablelimit of cost. The gain in freights to the people and the direct saving tothe Government of the United States in the use of its naval vessels wouldpay the entire cost of this work within a short series of years. The reportof the Secretary of the Navy shows the saving in our naval expenditureswhich would result.The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Morgan) in his argument upon this subjectbefore the Senate at the last session did not overestimate the importanceof this work when he said that "the canal is the most important subject nowconnected with the commercial growth and progress of the United States."If this work is to be promoted by the usual financial methods and withoutthe aid of this Government, the expenditures in its interest bearingsecurities and stock will probably be twice the actual cost. This willnecessitate higher tolls and constitute a heavy and altogether needlessburden upon our commerce and that of the world. Every dollar of the bondsand stock of the company should represent a dollar expended in thelegitimate and economical prosecution of the work. This is only possible bygiving to the bonds the guaranty of the United States Government. Such aguaranty would secure the ready sale at par of a 3 per cent bond from timeto time as the money was needed. I do not doubt that built upon thesebusiness methods the canal would when fully inaugurated earn its fixedcharges and operating expenses. But if its bonds are to be marketed atheavy discounts and every bond sold is to be accompanied by a gift ofstock, as has come to be expected by investors in such enterprises, thetraffic will be seriously burdened to pay interest and dividends. I amquite willing to recommend Government promotion in the prosecution of awork which, if no other means offered for securing its completion, is ofsuch transcendent interest that the Government should, in my opinion,secure it by direct appropriations from its Treasury.A guaranty of the bonds of the canal company to an amount necessary to thecompletion of the canal could, I think, be so given as not to involve anyserious risk of ultimate loss. The things to be carefully guarded are thecompletion of the work within the limits of the guaranty, the subrogationof the United States to the rights of the first mortgage bondholders forany amounts it may have to pay, and in the meantime a control of the stockof the company as a security against mismanagement and loss. I mostsincerely hope that neither party nor sectional lines will be drawn uponthis great American project, so full of interest to the people of all ourStates and so influential in its effects upon the prestige and prosperityof our common country.The island of Navassa, in the West Indian group, has, under the provisionsof Title VII of the Revised Statutes, been recognized by the President asappertaining to the United States. It contains guano deposits, is owned bythe Navassa Phosphate Company, and is occupied solely its employees. InSeptember, 1889, a revolt took place among these laborers, resulting in thekilling of some of the agents of the company, caused, as the laborersclaimed, by cruel treatment. These men were arrested and tried in theUnited States court at Baltimore, under section 5576 of the statutereferred to, as if the offenses had been committed on board a merchantvessel of the United States on the high seas. There appeared on the trialand otherwise came to me such evidences of the bad treatment of the menthat in consideration of this and of the fact that the men had no access toany public officer or tribunal for protection or the redress of theirwrongs I commuted the death sentences that had been passed by the courtupon three of them. In April last my attention was again called to thisisland and to the unregulated condition of things there by a letter from acolored laborer, who complained that he was wrongfully detained upon theisland by the phosphate company after the expiration of his contract ofservice. A naval vessel was sent to examine into the case of this man andgenerally into the condition of things on the island. It was found that thelaborer referred to had been detained beyond the contract limit and that acondition of revolt again existed among the laborers. A board of navalofficers reported, among other things, as follows: We would desire to statefurther that the discipline maintained on the island seems to be that of aconvict establishment without its comforts and cleanliness, and that untilmore attention is paid to the shipping of laborers by placing it underGovernment supervision to prevent misunderstanding and misrepresentation,and until some amelioration is shown in the treatment of the laborers,these disorders will be of constant occurrence. I recommend legislationthat shall place labor contracts upon this and other islands having therelation that Navassa has to the United States under the supervision of acourt commissioner, and that shall provide at the expense of the owners anofficer to reside upon the island, with power to judge and adjust disputesand to enforce a just and humane treatment of the employees. It isinexcusable that American laborers should be left within our ownjurisdiction without access to any Government officer or tribunal for theirprotection and the redress of their wrongs.International copyright has been secured, in accordance with the conditionsof the act of March 3, 1891, with Belgium, France, Great Britain and theBritish possessions, and Switzerland, the laws of those countriespermitting to our citizens the benefit of copyright on substantially thesame basis as to their own citizens or subjects.With Germany a special convention has been negotiated upon this subjectwhich will bring that country within the reciprocal benefits of ourlegislation.The general interest in the operations of the Treasury Department has beenmuch augmented during the last year by reason of the conflictingpredictions, which accompanied and followed the tariff and otherlegislation of the last Congress affecting the revenues, as to the resultsof this legislation upon the Treasury and upon the country. On the one handit was contended that imports would so fall off as to leave the Treasurybankrupt and that the prices of articles entering into the living of thepeople would be so enhanced as to disastrously affect their comfort andhappiness, while on the other it was argued that the loss to the revenue,largely the result of placing sugar on the free list, would be a directgain to the people; that the prices of the necessaries of life, includingthose most highly protected, would not be enhanced; that labor would have alarger market and the products of the farm advanced prices, while theTreasury surplus and receipts would be adequate to meet the appropriations,including the large exceptional expenditures for the refunding to theStates of the direct tax and the redemption of the 4 1/2 per cent bonds.It is not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of theeffects of the legislation to which I have referred; but a briefexamination of the statistics of the Treasury and a general glance at thestate of business throughout the country will, I think, satisfy anyimpartial inquirer that its results have disappointed the evil propheciesof its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful predictions ofits friends. Rarely, if ever before, in the history of the country hasthere been a time when the proceeds of one day\'s labor or the product ofone farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those things thatenter into the living of the masses of the people. I believe that a fulltest will develop the fact that the tariff act of the Fifty first Congressis very favorable in its average effect upon the prices of articlesentering into common use.During the twelve months from October 1, 1890, to September 30, 1891, thetotal value of our foreign commerce (imports and exports combined) was$1,747,806,406, which was the largest of any year in the history of theUnited States. The largest in any previous year was in 1890, when ourcommerce amounted to $1,647,139,093, and the last year exceeds thisenormous aggregate by over one hundred millions. It is interesting, and tosome will be surprising, to know that during the year ending September 30,1891, our imports of merchandise amounted to $824,715,270, which was anincrease of more than $11,000,000 over the value of the imports of thecorresponding months of the preceding year, when the imports of merchandisewere unusually large in anticipation of the tariff legislation thenpending. The average annual value of the imports of merchandise for the tenyears from 1881 to 1890 was $692,186,522, and during the year endingSeptember 30, 1891, this annual average was exceeded by $132,528,469.The value of free imports during the twelve months ending September 30,1891, was $118,092,387 more than the value of free imports during thecorresponding twelve months of the preceding year, and there was during thesame period a decrease of $106,846,508 in the value of imports of dutiablemerchandise. The percentage of merchandise admitted free of duty during theyear to which I have referred, the first under the new tariff, was 48.18,while during the preceding twelve months, under the old tariff, thepercentage was 34.27, an increase of 13.91 per cent. If we take the sixmonths ending September 30 last, which covers the time during which sugarshave been admitted free of duty, the per cent of value of merchandiseimported free of duty is found to be 55.37, which is a larger percentage offree imports than during any prior fiscal year in the history of theGovernment.If we turn to exports of merchandise, the statistics are full ofgratification. The value of such exports of merchandise for the twelvemonths ending September 30, 1891, was $923,091,136, while for thecorresponding previous twelve months it was $860,177,115, an increase of$62,914,021, which is nearly three times the average annual increase ofexports of merchandise for the preceding twenty years. This exceeds inamount and value the exports of merchandise during any year in the historyof the Government. The increase in the value of exports of agriculturalproducts during the year referred to over the corresponding twelve monthsof the prior year was $45,846,197, while the increase in the value ofexports of manufactured products was $16,838,240.There is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or domestic,there is certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class, tosuggest that the existing tariff and revenue legislation bears oppressivelyupon the people or retards the commercial development of the nation. It maybe argued that our condition would be better if tariff legislation wereupon a free trade basis; but it can not be denied that all the conditionsof prosperity and of general contentment are present in a larger degreethan ever before in our history, and that, too, just when it was prophesiedthey would be in the worst state. Agitation for radical changes in tariffand financial legislation can not help but may seriously impede business,to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation isessential.I think there are conclusive evidences that the new tariff has createdseveral great industries, which will within a few years give employment toseveral hundred thousand American working men and women. In view of thesomewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the United States,every patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a result.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the total receiptsof the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30,1891, were $458,544,233.03, while the expenditures for the same period were$421,304,470.46, leaving a surplus of $37,239,762.57.The receipts of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, actual and estimated,are $433,000,000 and the expenditures $409,000,000. For the fiscal yearending June 30, 1893, the estimated receipts are $455,336,350 and theexpenditures $441,300,093.Under the law of July 14, 1890, the Secretary of the Treasury has purchased(since August 13) during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounces of silverbullion at an average cost of $1.045 per ounce. The highest price paidduring the year was $1.2025 and the lowest $0.9636. In exchange for thissilver bullion there have been issued $50,577,498 of the Treasury notesauthorized by the act. The lowest price of silver reached during the fiscalyear was $0.9636 on April 22, 1891; but on November 1 the market price wasonly $0.96, which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74 1/4cents.Before the influence of the prospective silver legislation was felt in themarket silver was worth in New York about $0.955 per ounce. The ablestadvocates of free coinage in the last Congress were most confident in theirpredictions that the purchases by the Government required by the law wouldat once bring the price of silver to $1.2929 per ounce, which would makethe bullion value of a dollar 100 cents and hold it there. The propheciesof the antisilver men of disasters to result from the coinage of $2,000,000per month were not wider of the mark. The friends of free silver are notagreed, I think, as to the causes that brought their hopeful predictions tonaught. Some facts are known. The exports of silver from London to Indiaduring the first nine months of this calendar year fell off over 50 percent, or $17,202,730, compared with the same months of the preceding year.The exports of domestic silver bullion from this country, which hadaveraged for the last ten years over $17,000,000, fell in the last fiscalyear to $13,797,391, while for the first time in recent years the importsof silver into this country exceeded the exports by the sum of $2,745,365.In the previous year the net exports of silver from the United Statesamounted to $8,545,455. The production of the United States increased from50,000,000 ounces in 1889 to 54,500,000 in 1890. The Government is nowbuying and putting aside annually 54,000,000 ounces, which, allowing for7,140,000 ounces of new bullion used in the arts, is 6,640,000 more thanour domestic products available for coinage.I hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary and that afurther trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it. That theincreased volume of currency thus supplied for the use of the people wasneeded and that beneficial results upon trade and prices have followed thislegislation I think must be very clear to everyone. Nor should it beforgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued a full dollar\'s worthof silver bullion is at the time deposited in the Treasury as a securityfor its redemption. Upon this subject, as upon the tariff, myrecommendation is that the existing laws be given a full trial and that ourbusiness interests be spared the distressing influence which threats ofradical changes always impart. Under existing legislation it is in thepower of the Treasury Department to maintain that essential condition ofnational finance as well as of commercial prosperity the parity in use ofthe coined dollars and their paper representatives. The assurance thatthese powers would be freely and unhesitatingly used has done much toproduce and sustain the present favorable business conditions.I am still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existingconditions would disastrously affect our business interests at home andabroad. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing powerof the gold and silver dollar in our own markets, and in foreign trade thestamp gives no added value to the bullion contained in coins. The producersof the country, its farmers and laborers, have the highest interest thatevery dollar, paper or coin, issued by the Government shall be as good asany other. If there is one less valuable than another, its sure andconstant errand will be to pay them for their toil and for their crops. Themoney lender will protect himself by stipulating for payment in gold, butthe laborer has never been able to do that. To place business upon a silverbasis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the currency by thewithdrawal of gold and gold notes and such an unsettling of all values aswould produce a commercial panic. I can not believe that a people so strongand prosperous as ours will promote such a policy.The producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, but they shouldnot forget that the Government is now buying and putting out of the marketwhat is the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mines. This ismore than they themselves thought of asking two years ago. I believe it isthe earnest desire of a great majority of the people, as it is mine, that afull coin use shall be made of silver just as soon as the cooperation ofother nations can be secured and a ratio fixed that will give circulationequally to gold and silver. The business of the world requires the use ofboth metals; but I do not see any prospect of gain, but much of loss, bygiving up the present system, in which a full use is made of gold and alarge use of silver, for one in which silver alone will circulate. Such anevent would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silvermovement. Bimetallism is the desired end, and the true friends of silverwill be careful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver monometallismwith its necessary attendants the loss of our gold to Europe and therelief of the pressure there for a larger currency. I have endeavored bythe use of official and unofficial agencies to keep a close observation ofthe state of public sentiment in Europe upon this question and have notfound it to be such as to justify me in proposing an internationalconference. There is, however, I am sure, a growing sentiment in Europe infavor of a larger use of silver, and I know of no more effectual way ofpromoting this sentiment than by accumulating gold here. A scarcity of goldin the European reserves will be the most persuasive argument for the useof silver.The exports of gold to Europe, which began in February last and continueduntil the close of July, aggregated over $70,000,000. The net loss of goldduring the fiscal year was nearly $68,000,000. That no serious monetarydisturbance resulted was most gratifying and gave to Europe fresh evidenceof the strength and stability of our financial institutions. With themovement of crops the outflow of gold was speedily stopped and a return setin. Up to December 1 we had recovered of our gold lost at the port of NewYork $27,854,000, and it is confidently believed that during the winter andspring this aggregate will be steadily and largely increased.The presence of a large cash surplus in the Treasury has for many yearsbeen the subject of much unfavorable criticism, and has furnished anargument to those who have desired to place the tariff upon a purelyrevenue basis. It was agreed by all that the withdrawal from circulation ofso large an amount of money was an embarrassment to the business of thecountry and made necessary the intervention of the Department at frequentintervals to relieve threatened monetary panics. The surplus on March 1,1889, was $183,827,190.29. The policy of applying this surplus to theredemption of the interest bearing securities of the United States wasthought to be preferable to that of depositing it without interest inselected national banks. There have been redeemed since the date lastmentioned of interest bearing securities $259,079,350, resulting in areduction of the annual interest charge of $11,684,675. The money which hadbeen deposited in banks without interest has been gradually withdrawn andused in the redemption of bonds.The result of this policy, of the silver legislation, and of the refundingof the 4 1/2 per cent bonds has been a large increase of the money incirculation. At the date last named the circulation was $1,404,205,896, or$23.03 per capita, while on the 1st day of December, 1891, it had increasedto $1,577,262,070, or $24.38 per capita. The offer of the Secretary of theTreasury to the holders of the 4 1/2 per cent bonds to extend the time ofredemption, at the option of the Government, at an interest of 2 per cent,was accepted by the holders of about one half the amount, and theunextended bonds are being redeemed on presentation.The report of the Secretary of War exhibits the results of an intelligent,progressive, and businesslike administration of a Department which has beentoo much regarded as one of mere routine. The separation of SecretaryProctor from the Department by reason of his appointment as a Senator fromthe State of Vermont is a source of great regret to me and to hiscolleagues in the Cabinet, as I am sure it will be to all those who havehad business with the Department while under his charge.In the administration of army affairs some especially good work has beenaccomplished. The efforts of the Secretary to reduce the percentage ofdesertions by removing the causes that promoted it have been so successfulas to enable him to report for the last year a lower percentage ofdesertion than has been before reached in the history of the Army. Theresulting money saving is considerable, but the improvement in the moraleof the enlisted men is the most valuable incident of the reforms which havebrought about this result.The work of securing sites for shore batteries for harbor defense and themanufacture of mortars and guns of high power to equip them have made goodprogress during the year. The preliminary work of tests and plans which solong delayed a start is now out of the way. Some guns have been completed,and with an enlarged shop and a more complete equipment at Watervliet theArmy will soon be abreast of the Navy in gun construction. Whateverunavoidable causes of delay may arise, there should be none from delayed orinsufficient appropriations. We shall be greatly embarrassed in the properdistribution and use of naval vessels until adequate shore defenses areprovided for our harbors.I concur in the recommendation of the Secretary that the three battalionorganization be adopted for the infantry. The adoption of a smokelesspowder and of a modern rifle equal in range, precision, and rapidity offire to the best now in use will, I hope, not be longer delayed.The project of enlisting Indians and organizing them into separatecompanies upon the same basis as other soldiers was made the subject ofvery careful study by the Secretary and received my approval. Sevencompanies have been completely organized and seven more are in process oforganization. The results of six months\' training have more than realizedthe highest anticipations. The men are readily brought under discipline,acquire the drill with facility, and show great pride in the rightdischarge of their duty and perfect loyalty to their officers, who declarethat they would take them into action with confidence. The discipline,order, and cleanliness of the military posts will have a wholesome andelevating influence upon the men enlisted, and through them upon theirtribes, while a friendly feeling for the whites and a greater respect forthe Government will certainly be promoted.The great work done in the Record and Pension Division of the WarDepartment by Major Ainsworth, of the Medical Corps, and the clerks underhim is entitled to honorable mention. Taking up the work with nearly 41,000cases behind, he closed the last fiscal year without a single case leftover, though the new cases had increased 52 per cent in number over theprevious year by reason of the pension legislation of the last Congress.I concur in the recommendation of the Attorney General that the right infelony cases to a review by the Supreme court be limited. It would seemthat personal liberty would have a safe guaranty if the right of review incases involving only fine and imprisonment were limited to the circuitcourt of appeals, unless a constitutional question should in some way beinvolved.The judges of the Court of Private Land Claims, provided for by the act ofMarch 3, 1891, have been appointed and the court organized. It is nowpossible to give early relief to communities long repressed in theirdevelopment by unsettled land titles and to establish the possession andright of settlers whose lands have been rendered valueless by adverse andunfounded claims.The act of July 9, 1888, provided for the incorporation and management of areform school for girls in the District of Columbia; but it has remainedinoperative for the reason that no appropriation has been made forconstruction or maintenance. The need of such an institution is veryurgent. Many girls could be saved from depraved lives by the wholesomeinfluences and restraints of such a school. I recommend that the necessaryappropriation be made for a site and for construction.The enforcement by the Treasury Department of the law prohibiting thecoming of Chinese to the United States has been effective as to such asseek to land from vessels entering our ports. The result has been to divertthe travel to vessels entering the ports of British Columbia, whencepassage into the United States at obscure points along the Dominionboundary is easy. A very considerable number of Chinese laborers haveduring the past year entered the United States from Canada and Mexico.The officers of the Treasury Department and of the Department of Justicehave used every means at their command to intercept this immigration; butthe impossibility of perfectly guarding our extended frontier is apparent.The Dominion government collects a head tax of $50 from every Chinamanentering Canada, and thus derives a considerable revenue from those whoonly use its ports to reach a position of advantage to evade our exclusionlaws. There seems to be satisfactory evidence that the business of passingChinamen through Canada to the United States is organized and quite active.The Department of Justice has construed the laws to require the return ofany Chinaman found to be unlawfully in this country to China as the countryfrom which he came, notwithstanding the fact that he came by way of Canada;but several of the district courts have in cases brought before themoverruled this view of the law and decided that such persons must bereturned to Canada. This construction robs the law of all effectiveness,even if the decrees could be executed, for the men returned can the nextday recross our border. But the only appropriation made is for sending themback to China, and the Canadian officials refuse to allow them to reenterCanada without the payment of the fifty dollar head tax. I recommend suchlegislation as will remedy these defects in the law.In previous messages I have called the attention of Congress to thenecessity of so extending the jurisdiction of the United States courts asto make triable therein any felony committed while in the act of violatinga law of the United States. These courts can not have that independence andeffectiveness which the Constitution contemplates so long as the feloniouskilling of court officers, jurors, and witnesses in the discharge of theirduties or by reason of their acts as such is only cognizable in the Statecourts. The work done by the Attorney General and the officers of hisDepartment, even under the present inadequate legislation, has producedsome notable results in the interest of law and order.The Attorney General and also the Commissioners of the District of Columbiacall attention to the defectiveness and inadequacy of the laws relating tocrimes against chastity in the District of Columbia. A stringent code uponthis subject has been provided by Congress for Utah, and it is a matter ofsurprise that the needs of this District should have been so longoverlooked.In the report of the Postmaster General some very gratifying results areexhibited and many betterments of the service suggested. A perusal of thereport gives abundant evidence that the supervision and direction of thepostal system have been characterized by an intelligent and conscientiousdesire to improve the service. The revenues of the Department show anincrease of over $5,000,000, with a deficiency for the year 1892 of lessthan $4,000,000, while the estimate for the year 1893 shows a surplus ofreceipts over expenditures.Ocean mail post offices have been established upon the steamers of theNorth German Lloyd and Hamburg lines, saving by the distribution onshipboard from two to fourteen hours\' time in the delivery of mail at theport of entry and often much more than this in the delivery at interiorplaces. So thoroughly has this system, initiated by Germany and the UnitedStates, evidenced its usefulness that it can not be long before it isinstalled upon all the great ocean mail carrying steamships.Eight thousand miles of new postal service has been established uponrailroads, the car distribution to substations in the great cities has beenincreased about 12 per cent, while the percentage of errors in distributionhas during the past year been reduced over one half. An appropriation wasgiven by the last Congress for the purpose of making some experiments infree delivery in the smaller cities and towns. The results of theseexperiments have been so satisfactory that the Postmaster Generalrecommends, and I concur in the recommendation, that the free deliverysystem be at once extended to towns of 5,000 population. His discussion ofthe inadequate facilities extended under our present system to ruralcommunities and his suggestions with a view to give these communities afuller participation in the benefits of the postal service are worthy ofyour careful consideration. It is not just that the farmer, who receiveshis mail at a neighboring town, should not only be compelled to send to thepost office for it, but to pay a considerable rent for a box in which toplace it or to wait his turn at a general delivery window, while the cityresident has his mail brought to his door. It is stated that over 54,000neighborhoods are under the present system receiving mail at post officeswhere money orders and postal notes are not issued. The extension of thissystem to these communities is especially desirable, as the patrons of suchoffices are not possessed of the other facilities offered in more populouscommunities for the transmission of small sums of money.I have in a message to the preceding Congress expressed my views as to amodified use of the telegraph in connection with the postal service. Inpursuance of the ocean mail law of March 3, 1891, and after a most carefulstudy of the whole subject and frequent conferences with ship owners,boards of trade, and others, advertisements were issued by thepostmaster General for 53 lines of ocean mail service 10 to Great Britainand the Continent, 27 to South America, 3 to China and Japan, 4 toAustralia and the Pacific islands, 7 to the West Indies, and 2 to Mexico.It was not, of course, expected that bids for all these lines would bereceived or that service upon them all would be contracted for. It wasintended, in furtherance of the act, to secure as many new lines aspossible, while including in the list most or all of the foreign lines nowoccupied by American ships. It was hoped that a line to England and perhapsone to the Continent would be secured; but the outlay required to equipsuch lines wholly with new ships of the first class and the difficulty ofestablishing new lines in competition with those already establisheddeterred bidders whose interest had been enlisted. It is hoped that a waymay yet be found of overcoming these difficulties.The Brazil Steamship Company, by reason of a miscalculation as to the speedof its vessels, was not able to bid under the terms of the advertisement.The policy of the Department was to secure from the established lines animproved service as a condition of giving to them the benefits of the law.This in all instances has been attained. The Postmaster General estimatesthat an expenditure in American shipyards of about $10,000,000 will benecessary to enable the bidders to construct the ships called for by theservice which they have accepted. I do not think there is any reason fordiscouragement or for any turning back from the policy of this legislation.Indeed, a good beginning has been made, and as the subject is furtherconsidered and understood by capitalists and shipping people new lines willbe ready to meet future proposals, and we may date from the passage of thislaw the revival of American shipping interests and the recovery of a fairshare of the carrying trade of the world. We were receiving for foreignpostage nearly $2,000,000 under the old system, and the outlay for oceanmail service did not exceed $600,000 per annum. It is estimated by thePostmaster General that if all the contracts proposed are completed it willrequire $247,354 for this year in addition to the appropriation for sea andinland postage already in the estimates, and that for the next fiscal year,ending June 30, 1893, there would probably be needed about $560,000.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a gratifying increase of newnaval vessels in commission. The Newark, Concord, Bennington, andMiantonomoh have been added during the year, with an aggregate of somethingmore than 11,000 tons. Twenty four warships of all classes are now underconstruction in the navy yards and private shops; but while the work uponthem is going forward satisfactorily, the completion of the more importantvessels will yet require about a year\'s time. Some of the vessels nowunder construction, it is believed, will be triumphs of naval engineering.When it is recollected that the work of building a modern navy was onlyinitiated in the year 1883, that our naval constructors and shipbuilderswere practically without experience in the construction of large iron orsteel ships, that our engine shops were unfamiliar with great marineengines, and that the manufacture of steel forgings for guns and plates wasalmost wholly a foreign industry, the progress that has been made is notonly highly satisfactory, but furnishes the assurance that the UnitedStates will before long attain in the construction of such vessels, withtheir engines and armaments, the same preeminence which it attained whenthe best instrument of ocean commerce was the clipper ship and the mostimpressive exhibit of naval power the old wooden three decker man of war.The officers of the Navy and the proprietors and engineers of our greatprivate shops have responded with wonderful intelligence and professionalzeal to the confidence expressed by Congress in its liberal legislation. Wehave now at Washington a gun shop, organized and conducted by navalofficers, that in its system, economy, and product is unexcelled.Experiments with armor plate have been conducted during the year with mostimportant results. It is now believed that a plate of higher resistingpower than any in use has been found and that the tests have demonstratedthat cheaper methods of manufacture than those heretofore thought necessarycan be used.I commend to your favorable consideration the recommendations of theSecretary, who has, I am sure, given to them the most conscientious study.There should be no hesitation in promptly completing a navy of the bestmodern type large enough to enable this country to display its flag in allseas for the protection of its citizens and of its extending commerce. Theworld needs no assurance of the peaceful purposes of the United States, butwe shall probably be in the future more largely a competitor in thecommerce of the world, and it is essential to the dignity of this nationand to that peaceful influence which it should exercise on this hemispherethat its Navy should be adequate both upon the shores of the Atlantic andof the Pacific.The report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that a very gratifyingprogress has been made in all of the bureaus which make up that complex anddifficult Department.The work in the Bureau of Indian Affairs was perhaps never so large as now,by reason of the numerous negotiations which have been proceeding with thetribes for a reduction of the reservations, with the incident labor ofmaking allotments, and was never more carefully conducted. The provision ofadequate school facilities for Indian children and the locating of adultIndians upon farms involve the solution of the "Indian question."Everything else rations, annuities, and tribal negotiations, with theagents, inspectors, and commissioners who distribute and conduct them mustpass away when the Indian has become a citizen, secure in the individualownership of a farm from which he derives his subsistence by his own labor,protected by and subordinate to the laws which govern the white man, andprovided by the General Government or by the local communities in which helives with the means of educating his children. When an Indian becomes acitizen in an organized State or Territory, his relation to the GeneralGovernment ceases in great measure to be that of a ward; but the GeneralGovernment ought not at once to put upon the State or Territory the burdenof the education of his children.It has been my thought that the Government schools and school buildingsupon the reservations would be absorbed by the school systems of the Statesand Territories; but as it has been found necessary to protect the Indianagainst the compulsory alienation of his land by exempting him fromtaxation for a period of twenty five years, it would seem to be right thatthe General Government, certainly where there are tribal funds in itspossession, should pay to the school fund of the State what would beequivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the Indian. It willbe noticed from the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs thatalready some contracts have been made with district schools for theeducation of Indian children. There is great advantage, I think, inbringing the Indian children into mixed schools. This process will begradual, and in the meantime the present educational provisions andarrangements, the result of the best experience of those who have beencharged with this work, should be continued. This will enable thosereligious bodies that have undertaken the work of Indian education with somuch zeal and with results so restraining and beneficent to place theirinstitutions in new and useful relations to the Indian and to his whiteneighbors.The outbreak among the Sioux which occurred in December last is as to itscauses and incidents fully reported upon by the War Department and theDepartment of the Interior. That these Indians had some just complaints,especially in the matter of the reduction of the appropriation for rationsand in the delays attending the enactment of laws to enable the Departmentto perform the engagements entered into with them, is probably true; butthe Sioux tribes are naturally warlike and turbulent, and their warriorswere excited by their medicine men and chiefs, who preached the coming ofan Indian messiah who was to give them power to destroy their enemies. Inview of the alarm that prevailed among the white settlers near thereservation and of the fatal consequences that would have resulted from anIndian incursion, I placed at the disposal of General Miles, commanding theDivision of the Missouri, all such forces as were thought by him to berequired. He is entitled to the credit of having given thorough protectionto the settlers and of bringing the hostiles into subjection with the leastpossible loss of life.The appropriation of $2,991,450 for the Choctaws and Chickasaws containedin the general Indian appropriation bill of March 3, 1891, has not beenexpended, for the reason that I have not yet approved a release (to theGovernment) of the Indian claim to the lands mentioned. This matter will bemade the subject of a special message, placing before Congress all thefacts which have come to my knowledge.The relation of the Five Civilized Tribes now occupying the IndianTerritory to the United States is not, I believe, that best calculated topromote the highest advancement of these Indians. That there should bewithin our borders five independent states having no relations, exceptthose growing out of treaties, with the Government of the United States, norepresentation in the National Legislature, its people not citizens, is astartling anomaly.It seems to me to be inevitable that there shall be before long someorganic changes in the relation of these people to the United States. Whatform these changes should take I do not think it desirable now to suggest,even if they were well defined in my own mind. They should certainlyinvolve the acceptance of citizenship by the Indians and a representationin Congress. These Indians should have opportunity to present their claimsand grievances upon the floor rather than, as now, in the lobby. If acommission could be appointed to visit these tribes to confer with them ina friendly spirit upon this whole subject, even if no agreement werepresently reached the feeling of the tribes upon this question would bedeveloped, and discussion would prepare the way for changes which must comesooner or later.The good work of reducing the larger Indian reservations by allotments inseveralty to the Indians and the cession of the remaining lands to theUnited States for disposition under the homestead law has been prosecutedduring the year with energy and success. In September last I was enabled toopen to settlement in the Territory of Oklahoma 900,000 acres of land, allof which was taken up by settlers in a single day. The rush for these landswas accompanied by a great deal of excitement, but was happily free fromincidents of violence.It was a source of great regret that I was not able to open at the sametime the surplus lands of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation, amountingto about 3,000,000 acres, by reason of the insufficiency of theappropriation for making the allotments. Deserving and impatient settlersare waiting to occupy these lands, and I urgently recommend that a specialdeficiency appropriation be promptly made of the small amount needed, sothat the allotments may be completed and the surplus lands opened in timeto permit the settlers to get upon their homesteads in the early spring.During the past summer the Cherokee Commission have completed arrangementswith the Wichita, Kickapoo, and Tonkawa tribes whereby, if the agreementsare ratified by Congress, over 800,000 additional acres will be opened tosettlement in Oklahoma.The negotiations for the release by the Cherokees of their claim to theCherokee Strip have made no substantial progress so far as the Departmentis officially advised, but it is still hoped that the cession of this largeand valuable tract may be secured. The price which the commission wasauthorized to offer $1.25 per acre is, in my judgment, when all thecircumstances as to title and the character of the lands are considered, afair and adequate one, and should have been accepted by the Indians.Since March 4, 1889, about 23,000,000 acres have been separated from Indianreservations and added to the public domain for the use of those whodesired to secure free homes under our beneficent laws. It is difficult toestimate the increase of wealth which will result from the conversion ofthese waste lands into farms, but it is more difficult to estimate thebetterment which will result to the families that have found renewed hopeand courage in the ownership of a home and the assurance of a comfortablesubsistence under free and healthful conditions. It is also gratifying tobe able to feel, as we may, that this work has proceeded upon lines ofjustice toward the Indian, and that he may now, if he will, secure tohimself the good influences of a settled habitation, the fruits ofindustry, and the security of citizenship.Early in this Administration a special effort was begun to bring up thework of the General Land Office. By faithful work the arrearages have beenrapidly reduced. At the end of the last fiscal year only 84,172 finalagricultural entries remained undisposed of, and the Commissioner reportsthat with the present force the work can be fully brought up by the end ofthe next fiscal year.Your attention is called to the difficulty presented by the Secretary ofthe Interior as to the administration of the law of March 3, 1891,establishing a Court of Private Land Claims. The small holdings intended tobe protected by the law are estimated to be more than 15,000 in number. Theclaimants are a most deserving class and their titles are supported by thestrongest equities. The difficulty grows out of the fact that the landshave largely been surveyed according to our methods, while the holdings,many of which have been in the same family for generations, are laid out innarrow strips a few rods wide upon a stream and running back to the hillsfor pasturage and timber.. Provision should be made for numbering thesetracts as lots and for patenting them by such numbers and without referenceto section lines.The administration of the Pension Bureau has been characterized during theyear by great diligence. The total number of pensioners upon the roll onthe 30th day of June, 1891, was 676,160. There were allowed during thefiscal year ending at that time 250,565 cases. Of this number 102,387 wereallowed under the law of June 27, 1890. The issuing of certificates hasbeen proceeding at the rate of about 30,000 per month, about 75 per cent ofthese being cases under the new law. The Commissioner expresses the opinionthat he will be able to carefully adjudicate and allow 350,000 claimsduring the present fiscal year. The appropriation for the payment ofpensions for the fiscal year 1890 91 was $127,685,793.89 and the amountexpended $118,530,649.25, leaving an unexpended surplus of $9,155,144.64.The Commissioner is quite confident that there will be no call this yearfor a deficiency appropriation, notwithstanding the rapidity with which thework is being pushed. The mistake which has been made by many in theirexaggerated estimates of the cost of pensions is in not taking account ofthe diminished value of first payments under the recent legislation. Thesepayments under the general law have been for many years very large, as thepensions when allowed dated from the time of filing the claim, and most ofthese claims had been pending for years. The first payments under the lawof June, 1890, are relatively small, and as the per cent of these casesincreases and that of the old cases diminishes the annual aggregate offirst payments is largely reduced. The Commissioner, under date of November13, furnishes me with the statement that during the last four months113,175 certificates were issued, 27,893 under the general law and 85,282under the act of June 27, 1890. The average first payment during these fourmonths was $131.85, while the average first payment upon cases allowedduring the year ending June 30, 1891, was $239.33, being a reduction in theaverage first payments during these four months of $107.48.The estimate for pension expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30,1893, is $144,956,000, which, after a careful examination of the subject,the Commissioner is of the opinion will be sufficient. While thesedisbursements to the disabled soldiers of the great Civil War are large,they do not realize the exaggerated estimates of those who oppose thisbeneficent legislation. The Secretary of the Interior shows with greatfullness the care that is taken to exclude fraudulent claims, and also thegratifying fact that the persons to whom these pensions are going are menwho rendered not slight but substantial war service.The report of the Commissioner of Railroads shows that the total debt ofthe subsidized railroads to the United States was on December 31, 1890,$112,512,613.06. A large part of this debt is now fast approachingmaturity, with no adequate provision for its payment. Some policy fordealing with this debt with a view to its ultimate collection should be atonce adopted. It is very difficult, well nigh impossible, for so large abody as the Congress to conduct the necessary negotiations andinvestigations. I therefore recommend that provision be made for theappointment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for dealingwith this debt.The work of the Census Bureau is now far in advance and the great bulk ofthe enormous labor involved completed. It will be more strictly astatistical exhibit and less encumbered by essays than its immediatepredecessors. The methods pursued have been fair, careful, and intelligent,and have secured the approval of the statisticians who have followed themwith a scientific and nonpartisan interest. The appropriations necessary tothe early completion and publication of the authorized volumes should begiven in time to secure against delays, which increase the cost and at thesame time diminish the value of the work.The report of the Secretary exhibits with interesting fullness thecondition of the Territories. They have shared with the States the greatincrease in farm products, and are bringing yearly large areas intocultivation by extending their irrigating canals. This work is being doneby individuals or local corporations and without that system which a fullpreliminary survey of the water supply and of the irrigable lands wouldenable them to adopt. The future of the Territories of New Mexico, Arizona,and Utah in their material growth and in the increase, independence, andhappiness of their people is very largely dependent upon wise and timelylegislation, either by Congress or their own legislatures, regulating thedistribution of the water supply furnished by their streams. If this matteris much longer neglected, private corporations will have unrestrictedcontrol of one of the elements of life and the patentees of the arid landswill be tenants at will of the water companies.The United States should part with its ownership of the water sources andthe sites for reservoirs, whether to the States and Territories or toindividuals or corporations, only upon conditions that will insure to thesettlers their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable terms. In theTerritories this whole subject is under the full control of Congress, andin the States it is practically so as long as the Government holds thetitle to the reservoir sites and water sources and can grant them upon suchconditions as it chooses to impose. The improvident granting of franchisesof enormous value without recompense to the State or municipality fromwhich they proceed and without proper protection of the public interests isthe most noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation. This faultshould not be committed in dealing with a subject that will before manyyears affect so vitally thousands of our people.The legislation of Congress for the repression of polygamy has, after yearsof resistance on the part of the Mormons, at last brought them to theconclusion that resistance is unprofitable and unavailing. The power ofCongress over this subject should not be surrendered until we havesatisfactory evidence that the people of the State to be created wouldexercise the exclusive power of the State over this subject in the sameway. The question is not whether these people now obey the laws of Congressagainst polygamy, but rather would they make, enforce, and maintain suchlaws themselves if absolutely free to regulate the subject? We can notafford to experiment with this subject, for when a State is onceconstituted the act is final and any mistake irretrievable. No compact inthe enabling act could, in my opinion, be binding or effective.I recommend that provision be made for the organization of a simple form oftown government in Alaska, with power to regulate such matters as areusually in the States under municipal control. These local civilorganizations will give better protection in some matters than the presentskeleton Territorial organization. Proper restrictions as to the power tolevy taxes and to create debt should be imposed.If the establishment of the Department of Agriculture was regarded byanyone as a mere concession to the unenlightened demand of a worthy classof people, that impression has been most effectually removed by the greatresults already attained. Its home influence has been very great indisseminating agricultural and horticultural information, in stimulatingand directing a further diversification of crops, in detecting anderadicating diseases of domestic animals, and, more than all, in the closeand informal contact which it has established and maintains with thefarmers and stock raisers of the whole country. Every request forinformation has had prompt attention and every suggestion meritedconsideration. The scientific corps of the Department is of a high orderand is pushing its investigations with method and enthusiasm.The inspection by this Department of cattle and pork products intended forshipment abroad has been the basis of the success which has attended ourefforts to secure the removal of the restrictions maintained by theEuropean Governments.For ten years protests and petitions upon this subject from the packers andstock raisers of the United States have been directed against theserestrictions, which so seriously limited our markets and curtailed theprofits of the farm. It is a source of general congratulation that successhas at last been attained, for the effects of an enlarged foreign marketfor these meats will be felt not only by the farmer, but in our publicfinances and in every branch of trade. It is particularly fortunate thatthe increased demand for food products resulting from the removal of therestrictions upon our meats and from the reciprocal trade arrangements towhich I have referred should have come at a time when the agriculturalsurplus is so large. Without the help thus derived lower prices would haveprevailed. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates that the restrictionsupon the importation of our pork products into Europe lost us a market for$20,000,000 worth of these products annually.The grain crop of this year was the largest in our history 50 per centgreater than that of last year and yet the new markets that have beenopened and the larger demand resulting from short crops in Europe havesustained prices to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meats andbreadstuffs will be marketed at good prices, bringing relief and prosperityto an industry that was much depressed. The value of the grain crop of theUnited States is estimated by the Secretary to be this year $500,000,000more than last; of meats $150,000,000 more, and of all products of the farm$700,000,000 more. It is not inappropriate, I think, here to suggest thatour satisfaction in the contemplation of this marvelous addition to thenational wealth is unclouded by any suspicion of the currency by which itis measured and in which the farmer is paid for the products of hisfields.The report of the Civil Service Commission should receive the carefulattention of the opponents as well as the friends of this reform. TheCommission invites a personal inspection by Senators and Representatives ofits records and methods, and every fair critic will feel that such anexamination should precede a judgment of condemnation either of the systemor its administration. It is not claimed that either is perfect, but Ibelieve that the law is being executed with impartiality and that thesystem is incomparably better and fairer than that of appointments uponfavor. I have during the year extended the classified service to includesuperintendents, teachers, matrons, and physicians in the Indian service.This branch of the service is largely related to educational andphilanthropic work and will obviously be the better for the change.The heads of the several Executive Departments have been directed toestablish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative ratingof the clerks within the classified service, with a view to placingpromotions therein upon the basis of merit. I am confident that such arecord, fairly kept and open to the inspection of those interested, willpowerfully stimulate the work of the Departments and will be accepted byall as placing the troublesome matter of promotions upon a just basis.I recommend that the appropriation for the Civil Service Commission be madeadequate to the increased work of the next fiscal year.I have twice before urgently called the attention of Congress to thenecessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroademployees, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June 30,1890, 369 brakemen were killed and 7,841 maimed while engaged in couplingcars. The total number of railroad employees killed during the year was2,451 and the number injured 22,390. This is a cruel and largely needlesssacrifice. The Government is spending nearly $1,000,000 annually to savethe lives of shipwrecked seamen; every steam vessel is rigidly inspectedand required to adopt the most approved safety appliances. All this isgood. But how shall we excuse the lack of interest and effort in behalf ofthis army of brave young men who in our land commerce are being sacrificedevery year by the continued use of antiquated and dangerous appliances? Alaw requiring of every railroad engaged in interstate commerce theequipment each year of a given per cent of its freight cars with automaticcouplers and air brakes would compel an agreement between the roads as tothe kind of brakes and couplers to be used, and would very soon and verygreatly reduce the present fearful death rate among railroad employees.The method of appointment by the States of electors of President andVice President has recently attracted renewed interest by reason of adeparture by the State of Michigan from the method which had become uniformin all the States. Prior to 1832 various methods had been used by thedifferent States, and even by the same State. In some the choice was madeby the legislature; in others electors were chosen by districts, but moregenerally by the voters of the whole State upon a general ticket. Themovement toward the adoption of the last named method had an earlybeginning and went steadily forward among the States until in 1832 thereremained but a single State (South Carolina) that had not adopted it. ThatState until the Civil War continued to choose its electors by a vote of thelegislature, but after the war changed its method and conformed to thepractice of the other States. For nearly sixty years all the States saveone have appointed their electors by a popular vote upon a general ticket,and for nearly thirty years this method was universal.After a full test of other methods, without important division or dissentin any State and without any purpose of party advantage, as we mustbelieve, but solely upon the considerations that uniformity was desirableand that a general election in territorial divisions not subject to changewas most consistent with the popular character of our institutions, bestpreserved the equality of the voters, and perfectly removed the choice ofPresident from the baneful influence of the "gerrymander," the practice ofall the States was brought into harmony. That this concurrence should nowbe broken is, I think, an unfortunate and even a threatening episode, andone that may well suggest whether the States that still give their approvalto the old and prevailing method ought not to secure by a constitutionalamendment a practice which has had the approval of all. The recent Michiganlegislation provides for choosing what are popularly known as theCongressional electors for President by Congressional districts and the twoSenatorial electors by districts created for that purpose. This legislationwas, of course, accompanied by a new Congressional apportionment, and thetwo statutes bring the electoral vote of the State under the influence ofthe "gerrymander."These gerrymanders for Congressional purposes are in most cases buttressedby a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making it impossiblefor a majority of the legal voters of the State to correct theapportionment and equalize the Congressional districts. A minority rule isestablished that only a political convulsion can overthrow. I have recentlybeen advised that in one county of a certain State three districts for theelection of members of the legislature are constituted as follows: One has65,000 population, one 15,000, and one 10,000, while in another countydetached, noncontiguous sections have been united to make a legislativedistrict. These methods have already found effective application to thechoice of Senators and Representatives in Congress, and now an evil starthas been made in the direction of applying them to the choice by the Statesof electors of President and Vice President. If this is accomplished, weshall then have the three great departments of the Government in the graspof the "gerrymander," the legislative and executive directly and thejudiciary indirectly through the power of appointment.An election implies a body of electors having prescribed qualifications,each one of whom has an equal value and influence in determining theresult. So when the Constitution provides that "each State shall appoint"(elect), "in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number ofelectors," etc., an unrestricted power was not given to the legislatures inthe selection of the methods to be used. "A republican form of government"is guaranteed by the Constitution to each State, and the power given by thesame instrument to the legislatures of the States to prescribe methods forthe choice by the State of electors must be exercised under thatlimitation. The essential features of such a government are the right ofthe people to choose their own officers and the nearest practicableequality of value in the suffrages given in determining that choice.It will not be claimed that the power given to the legislature wouldsupport a law providing that the persons receiving the smallest vote shouldbe the electors or a law that all the electors should be chosen by thevoters of a single Congressional district. The State is to choose, andfinder the pretense of regulating methods the legislature can neither vestthe right of choice elsewhere nor adopt methods not conformable torepublican institutions. It is not my purpose here to discuss the questionwhether a choice by the legislature or by the voters of equal singledistricts is a choice by the State, but only to recommend such regulationof this matter by constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity andprevent that disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty ofchoice, if it exists, offers a temptation.Nothing just now is more important than to provide every guaranty for theabsolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respectiveStates of all the officers of the National Government, whether thatsuffrage is applied directly, as in the choice of members of the House ofRepresentatives, or indirectly, as in the choice of Senators and electorsof President. Respect for public officers and obedience to law will notcease to be the characteristics of our people until our elections cease todeclare the will of majorities fairly ascertained without fraud,suppression, or gerrymander. If I were called upon to declare wherein ourchief national danger lies, I should say without hesitation in theoverthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of thepopular suffrage. That there is a real danger here all must agree; but theenergies of those who see it have been chiefly expended in trying to fixresponsibility upon the opposite party rather than in efforts to make suchpractices impossible by either party.Is it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive debatewhile we take by consent one step in the direction of reform by eliminatingthe gerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties as an influence inthe selection of electors of President and members of Congress? All theStates have, acting freely and separately, determined that the choice ofelectors by a general ticket is the wisest and safest method, and it wouldseem there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment making thatmethod permanent. If a legislature chosen in one year upon purely localquestions should, pending a Presidential contest, meet, rescind the law fora choice upon a general ticket, and provide for the choice of electors bythe legislature, and this trick should determine the result, it is not toomuch to say that the public peace might be seriously and widelyendangered.I have alluded to the "gerrymander" as affecting the method of selectingelectors of President by Congressional districts, but the primary intentand effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selectionof members of the House of Representatives. The power of Congress is ampleto deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse. The unfailing test ofsincerity in election reform will be found in a willingness to confer as toremedies and to put into force such measures as will most effectuallypreserve the right of the people to free and equal representation.An attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear theconstitutional powers of the General Government for the correction of fraudagainst the suffrage. It is important to know whether the opposition tosuch measures is really rested in particular features supposed to beobjectionable or includes any proposition to give to the election laws ofthe United States adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledgedevils. I must yet entertain the hope that it is possible to secure a calm,patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory changes as maybe necessary to secure the choice of the officers of the Government to thepeople by fair apportionments and free elections.I believe it would be possible to constitute a commission, nonpartisan inits membership and composed of patriotic, wise, and impartial men, to whoma consideration of the question of the evils connected with our electionsystem and methods might be committed with a good prospect of securingunanimity in some plan for removing or mitigating those evils. TheConstitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vested inthe Supreme Court if that method would give the best guaranty ofimpartiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiringinto the whole subject of the law of elections as related to the choice ofofficers of the National Government, with a view to securing to everyelector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near anapproach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is attainable.While the policies of the General Government upon the tariff, upon therestoration of our merchant marine, upon river and harbor improvements, andother such matters of grave and general concern are liable to be turnedthis way or that by the results of Congressional elections andadministrative policies, sometimes involving issues that tend to peace orwar, to be turned this way or that by the results of a Presidentialelection, there is a rightful interest in all the States and in everyCongressional district that will not be deceived or silenced by theaudacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legalvoters in any State or in any Congressional district to give theirsuffrages freely upon these general questions is a matter only of localconcern or control. The demand that the limitations of suffrage shall befound in the law, and only there, is a just demand, and no just man shouldresent or resist it. My appeal is and must continue to be for aconsultation that shall "proceed with candor, calmness, and patience uponthe lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty."To the consideration of these very grave questions I invite not only theattention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens. We must notentertain the delusion that our people have ceased to regard a free ballotand equal representation as the price of their allegiance to laws and tocivil magistrates.I have been greatly rejoiced to notice many evidences of the increasedunification of our people and of a revived national spirit. The vista thatnow opens to us is wider and more glorious than ever before. Gratificationand amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate the population,wealth, and moral strength of our country. A trust momentous in itsinfluence upon our people and upon the world is for a brief time committedto us, and we must not be faithless to its first condition the defense ofthe free and equal influence of the people in the choice of public officersand in the control of public affairs.
Benjamin Harrison
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In submitting my annual message to Congress I have great satisfaction inbeing able to say that the general conditions affecting the commercial andindustrial interests of the United States are in the highest degreefavorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the mostfavored period in the history of the country will, I believe, show that sohigh a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts oflife were never before enjoyed by our people.The total wealth of the country in 1860 was $16,159,616,068. In 1890 itamounted to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 287 per cent.The total mileage of railways in the United States in 1860 was 30,626. In1890 it was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated thatthere will be about 4,000 miles of track added by the close of the year1892.The official returns of the Eleventh Census and those of the Tenth Censusfor seventy five leading cities furnish the basis for the followingcomparisons:In 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1,232,839,670.In 1890 the capital invested in manufacturing was $2,900,735,884.In 1880 the number of employees was 1,301,388.In 1890 the number of employees was 2,251,134.In 1880 the wages earned were $501,965,778.In 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170,454.In 1880 the value of the product was $2,711,579,899.In 1890 the value of the product was $4,860,286,837.I am informed by the Superintendent of the Census that the omission ofcertain industries in 1880 which were included in 1890 accounts in part forthe remarkable increase thus shown, but after making full allowance fordifferences of method and deducting the returns for all industries notincluded in the census of 1880 there remain in the reports from theseseventy five cities an increase in the capital employed of $1,522,745,604,in the value of the product of $2,024,236,166, in wages earned of$677,943,929, and in the number of wage earners employed of 856,029. Thewage earnings not only show an increased aggregate, but an increase percapita from $386 in 1880 to $547 in 1890, or 41.71 per cent.The new industrial plants established since October 6, 1890, and up toOctober 22, 1892, as partially reported in the American Economist, number345, and the extension of existing plants 108; the new capital investedamounts to $40,449,050, and the number of additional employees to 37,285.The Textile World for July, 1892, states that during the first six monthsof the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of which 40 arecotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk mills, 4 plushmills, and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in theSouthern States. Mr. A. B. Shepperson, of the New York Cotton Exchange,estimates the number of working spindles in the United States on September1, 1892, at 15,200,000, an increase of 660,000 over the year 1891. Theconsumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,396,000 bales, and in1892 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales. From the year 1869 to1892, inclusive, there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton inEurope of 92 per cent, while during the same period the increasedconsumption in the United States has been about 150 per cent.The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of the Treasury Department, showsthat at the date of September 30, 1892, there were 32 companiesmanufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and 14 companiesbuilding new works for such manufacture. The estimated investment inbuildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1893, ifexisting conditions were to be continued, was $5,000,000 and the estimatedrate of production 200,000,000 pounds per annum. The actual production forthe quarter ending September 30, 1892, was 10,952,725 pounds.The report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during theyear 1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing establishments in that Stateembraced within the special inquiry made by him, and representing 67different industries, there was a net increase over the year 1890 of$30,315,130.68 in the value of the product and of $6,377,925.09 in theamount of wages paid. The report of the commissioner of labor for the Stateof Massachusetts shows that 3,745 industries in that State paid$129,416,248 in wages during the year 1891, against $126,030,303 in 1890,an increase of $3,335,945, and that there was an increase of $9,932,490 inthe amount of capital and of 7,346 in the number of persons employed in thesame period.During the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months of1892 the total production of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, as against9,202,703 tons in the year 1890, which was the largest annual productionever attained. For the same twelve months of 1891 92 the production ofBessemer ingots was 3,878,581 tons, an increase of 189,710 gross tons overthe previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,688,871 gross tons in1890. The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first six months of1892 was 772,436 gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons during the lastsix months of the year 1891.The total value of our foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise)during the last fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an increase of $128,283,604over the previous fiscal year. The average annual value of our imports andexports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was$1,457,322,019. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1892exceeded this annual average value by $400,358,591, an increase of 27.47per cent. The significance and value of this increase are shown by the factthat the excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in the value ofexports, for there was a decrease in the value of imports of $17,513,754.The value of our exports during the fiscal year 1892 reached the highestfigure in the history of the Government, amounting to $1,030,278,148,exceeding by $145,797,338 the exports of 1891 and exceeding the value ofthe imports by $202,875,686. A comparison of the value of our exports for1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows anexcess of $265,142,651, or of 34.65 per cent. The value of our imports ofmerchandise for 1892, which was $829,402,462, also exceeded the annualaverage value of the ten years prior to 1891 by $135,215,940. During thefiscal year 1892 the value of imports free of duty amounted to$457,999,658, the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce. Thevalue of the imports of merchandise entered free of duty in 1892 was 55.35per cent of the total value of imports, as compared with 43.35 per cent in1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890.In our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress, therehaving been in the last four years an increase of 16 per cent. In internalcommerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has everbefore existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of the GreatLakes in 1890 aggregated 28,295,959 tons. On the Mississippi, Missouri, andOhio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic aggregated29,405,046 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing through the DetroitRiver during that year was 21,684,000 tons. The vessel tonnage entered andcleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890 amounted to 13,480,767tons, and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total for these two greatshipping ports of 24,422,568 tons, only slightly in excess of the vesseltonnage passing through the Detroit River. And it should be said that theseason for the Detroit River was but 228 days, while of course in Londonand Liverpool the season was for the entire year. The vessel tonnagepassing through the St. Marys Canal for the fiscal year 1892 amounted to9,828,874 tons, and the freight tonnage of the Detroit River is estimatedfor that year at 25,000,000 tons, against 23,209,619 tons in 1891. Theaggregate traffic on our railroads for the year 1891 amounted to704,398,609 tons of freight, compared with 691,344,437 tons in 1890, anincrease of 13,054,172 tons.Another indication of the general prosperity of the country is found in thefact that the number of depositors in savings banks increased from 693,870in 1860 to 4,258,893 in 1890, an increase of 513 per cent, and the amountof deposits from $149,277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844,506 in 1890, anincrease of 921 per cent. In 1891 the amount of deposits in savings bankswas $1,623,079,749. It is estimated that 90 per cent of these depositsrepresent the savings of wage earners. The bank clearances for nine monthsending September 30, 1891, amounted to $41,049,390,08. For the same monthsin 1892 they amounted to $45,189,601,947, an excess for the nine months of$4,140,211,139.There never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant orwhen wages were as high, whether measured by the currency in which they arepaid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. Itis true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is oneof the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer can not produceupon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate productionof the year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which followsoverproduction. But while the fact I have stated is true as to the cropsmentioned, the general average of prices has been such as to give toagriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity. The value ofour total farm products has increased from $1,363,646,866 in 1860 to$4,500,000,000 in 1891, as estimated by statisticians, an increase of 230per cent. The number of hogs January 1, 1891, was 50,625,106 and theirvalue $210,193,925; on January 1, 1892, the number was 52,398,019 and thevalue $241,031,415. On January 1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36,875,648and the value $544,127,908; on January 1 ,1892, the number was 37,651,239and the value $570,749,155.If any are discontented with their state here, if any believe that wages orprices, the returns for honest toil, are inadequate, they should not failto remember that there is no other country in the world where theconditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highlyprosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange the returnsof his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester workmentheir wages for those of their fellows at Fall River.I believe that the protective system, which has now for something more thanthirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation, has been a mightyinstrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerfulagency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want.I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working peoplerates of wages that would not only give daily bread but supply acomfortable margin for those home attractions and family comforts andenjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They areAmerican citizens a part of the great people for whom our Constitution andGovernment were framed and instituted and it can not be a perversion ofthat Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes thecomfort, independence, loyalty, and sense of interest in the Governmentwhich are essential to good citizenship in peace, and which will bring thisstalwart throng, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag when it isassailed.It is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protectivetariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as havingintroduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff,constructed upon the lines of protection, is to be repealed and that thereis to be substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with referenceto revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keepopen an American mill or keep up the wages of an American workman, but thatin every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring to theTreasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. Thecontention has not been between schedules, but between principles, and itwould be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry intolegislation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to thepeople. The tariff bills passed by the House of Representatives at the lastsession were, as I suppose, even in the opinion of their promoters,inadequate, and justified only by the fact that the Senate and House ofRepresentatives were not in accord and that a general revision could nottherefore be undertaken.I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to theincoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayedfor at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changesintroduces so much uncertainty that an amount, not easily estimated, ofbusiness inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result. Itis possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased revenuesfrom customs duties, for our merchants will make cautious orders forforeign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and theuncertainty as to when they will take effect. Those who have advocated aprotective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecasts of achange of policy disappointed. If a system of customs duties can be framedthat will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd ourwarehouses with foreign made goods and at the same time keep our own millsbusy; that will give us an increased participation in the "markets of theworld" of greater value than the home market we surrender; that will giveincreased work to foreign workmen upon products to be consumed by ourpeople without diminishing the amount of work to be done here; that willenable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 100 percent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill, and yet to compete inour market and in foreign markets with the foreign producer; that willfurther reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing thewages of those who produce them; that can be celebrated, after its effectshave been realized, as its expectation has been in European as well as inAmerican cities, the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to thehighest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of thecontrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff, but thisgeneration has not felt them, and the experience of one generation is nothighly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective system withundiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will awaitthe results of the new experiment.The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between theemployees and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments havenot been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effectupon wages of the protective system. The facts that his wages were thehighest paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of thisrate of wages in the absence of protective duties upon the product of hislabor was impossible were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests.He may now be able to review the question in the light of his personalexperience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If thatexperience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are therebymaintained or increased, either absolutely or in their purchasing power,and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country isincreased or even maintained, so that there are more or as many days\' workin a year, at as good or better wages, for the American workmen as has beenthe case under the protective system, everyone will rejoice. A generalprocess of wage reduction can not be contemplated by any patriotic citizenwithout the gravest apprehension. It may be, indeed I believe is, possiblefor the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreignrival in many branches of production without the defense of protectiveduties if the pay rolls are equalized; but the conflict that stands betweenthe producer and that result and the distress of our working people when itis attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The Society of the Unemployed,now holding its frequent and threatening parades in the streets of foreigncities, should not be allowed to acquire an American domicile.The reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments, which areherewith submitted, have very naturally included a resume of the whole workof the Administration with the transactions of the last fiscal year. Theattention not only of Congress but of the country is again invited to themethods of administration which have been pursued and to the results whichhave been attained. Public revenues amounting to $1,414,079,292.28 havebeen collected and disbursed without loss from misappropriation, without asingle defalcation of such importance as to attract the public attention,and at a diminished per cent of cost for collection. The public businesshas been transacted not only with fidelity, but progressively and with aview to giving to the people in the fullest possible degree the benefits ofa service established and maintained for their protection and comfort.Our relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any seriouscontroversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany andEngland relating to Samoan affairs, with England in relation to the sealfisheries in the Bering Sea, and with Chile growing out of the Baltimoreaffair have been adjusted.There have been negotiated and concluded, under section 3 of the tarifflaw, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the followingcountries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico,Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain for certain WestIndian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras, andAustria Hungary.Of these, those with Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain,Nicaragua, Honduras, and Austria Hungary have been concluded since my lastannual message. Under these trade arrangements a free or favored admissionhas been secured in every case for an important list of American products.Especial care has been taken to secure markets for farm products, in orderto relieve that great underlying industry of the depression which the lackof an adequate foreign market for our surplus often brings. An opening hasalso been made for manufactured products that will undoubtedly, if thispolicy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. The full benefitsof these arrangements can not be realized instantly. New lines of trade areto be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the field. Themanufacturer must adapt his goods to the new markets and facilities forexchange must be established. This work has been well begun, our merchantsand manufacturers having entered the new fields with courage andenterprise. In the case of food products, and especially with Cuba, thetrade did not need to wait, and the immediate results have been mostgratifying. If this policy and these trade arrangements can be continued inforce and aided by the establishment of American steamship lines, I do notdoubt that we shall within a short period secure fully one third of thetotal trade of the countries of Central and South America, which nowamounts to about $600,000,000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent ofthis trade.The following statistics show the increase in our trade with the countrieswith which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when suchagreements went into effect up to September 30, 1892, the increase being insome almost wholly and in others in an important degree the result of theseagreements:The domestic exports to Germany and Austria Hungary have increased in valuefrom $47,673,756 to $57,993,064, an increase of $10,319,308, or 21.63 percent. With American countries the value of our exports has increased from$44,160,285 to $54,613,598, an increase of $10,453,313, or 23.67 per cent.The total increase in the value of exports to all the countries with whichwe have reciprocity agreements has been $20,772,621. This increase ischiefly in wheat, flour, meat, and dairy products and in manufactures ofiron and steel and lumber. There has been a large increase in the value ofimports from all these countries since the commercial agreements went intoeffect, amounting to $74,294,525, but it has been entirely in imports fromthe American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, india rubber,and crude drugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for theSouth American market has been attracted to this new American policy and toour acquisition and their loss of South American trade.A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britainand the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bering Sea wasconcluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was accompanied by anagreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration, and avigorous effort was made during this season to drive out all poachingsealers from the Bering Sea. Six naval vessels, three revenue cutters, andone vessel from the Fish Commission, all under the command of CommanderEvans, of the Navy, were sent into the sea, which was systematicallypatrolled. Some seizures were made, and it is believed that the catch inthe Bering Sea by poachers amounted to less than 500 seals. It is true,however, that in the North Pacific, while the seal herds were on their wayto the passes between the Aleutian Islands, a very large number, probably35,000, were taken. The existing statutes of the United States do notrestrain our citizens from taking seals in the Pacific Ocean, and perhapsshould not unless the prohibition can be extended to the citizens of othernations. I recommend that power be given to the President by proclamationto prohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by American vessels incase, either as the result of the findings of the Tribunal of Arbitrationor otherwise, the restraints can be applied to the vessels of allcountries. The case of the United States for the Tribunal of Arbitrationhas been prepared with great care and industry by the Hon. John W. Foster,and the counsel who represent this Government express confidence that aresult substantially establishing our claims and preserving this greatindustry for the benefit of all nations will be attained.During the past year a suggestion was received through the British ministerthat the Canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility ofenlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canadaand of the United States, and a conference was held at Washington, with Mr.Blaine acting for this Government and the British minister at this capitaland three members of the Dominion cabinet acting as commissioners on thepart of Great Britain. The conference developed the fact that the Canadiangovernment was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange forthe concessions asked the admission of natural products. The statement wasfrankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States asagainst the mother country. This admission, which was foreseen, necessarilyterminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchangeof natural products would be almost wholly with the people of Canada. Someother topics of interest were considered in the conference, and haveresulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundaryand the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay adjacent to Eastport, Me., and in theinitiation of an arrangement for the protection of fish life in thecoterminous and neighboring waters of our northern border.The controversy as to tolls upon the Welland Canal, which was presented toCongress at the last session by special message, having failed ofadjustment, I felt constrained to exercise the authority conferred by theact of July 26, 1892, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St.Marys Falls Canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada. The Secretaryof the Treasury established such tolls as were thought to be equivalent tothe exactions unjustly levied upon our commerce in the Canadian canals.If, as we must suppose, the political relations of Canada and thedisposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a somewhatradical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be made. Ourrelations must continue to be intimate, and they should be friendly. Iregret to say, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those asto the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific, andthe canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain have continuously beenthwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protestsfrom Canada in the matter of the canal tolls our treaty rights wereflagrantly disregarded. It is hardly too much to say that the CanadianPacific and other railway lines which parallel our northern boundary aresustained by commerce having either its origin or terminus, or both, in theUnited States. Canadian railroads compete with those of the United Statesfor our traffic, and without the restraints of our interstate commerce act.Their cars pass almost without detention into and out of our territory.The Canadian Pacific Railway brought into the United States from China andJapan via British Columbia during the year ended June 30, 1892, 23,239,689pounds of freight, and it carried from the United States, to be shipped toChina and Japan via British Columbia, 24,068,346 pounds of freight. Therewere also shipped from the United States over this road from Eastern portsof the United States to our Pacific ports during the same year 13,912,073pounds of freight, and there were received over this road at the UnitedStates Eastern ports from ports on the Pacific Coast 13,293,315 pounds offreight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, Jr., former chief of the Bureau of Statistics,when before the Senate Select Committee on Relations with Canada, April 26,1890, said that "the value of goods thus transported between differentpoints in the United States across Canadian territory probably amounts to$100,000,000 a year."There is no disposition on the part of the people or Government of theUnited States to interfere in the smallest degree with the politicalrelations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It istime for us, however, to consider whether, if the present state of thingsand trend of things is to continue, our interchanges upon lines of landtransportation should not be put upon a different basis and our entireindependence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence as an outlet to thesea secured by the construction of an American canal around the Falls ofNiagara and the opening of ship communication between the Great Lakes andone of our own seaports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of ourgreat natural trade advantages. We should withdraw the support which isgiven to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic thatproperly belongs to us and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten theotherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have beengiven to them. The subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with thismatter without further legislation has been under consideration, butcircumstances have postponed a conclusion. It is probable that aconsideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of thearticle of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit of goods inbond is involved in any complete solution of the question.Congress at the last session was kept advised of the progress of theserious and for a time threatening difference between the United States andChile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the ChileanGovernment in a most friendly and honorable spirit has tendered and paid asan indemnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who werekilled and to those who were injured in the outbreak in the city ofValparaiso the sum of $75,000. This has been accepted not only as anindemnity for a wrong done, but as a most gratifying evidence that theGovernment of Chile rightly appreciates the disposition of this Governmentto act in a spirit of the most absolute fairness and friendliness in ourintercourse with that brave people. A further and conclusive evidence ofthe mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the factthat a convention submitting to arbitration the mutual claims of thecitizens of the respective Governments has been agreed upon. Some of theseclaims have been pending for many years and have been the occasion of muchunsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence.I have endeavored in every way to assure our sister Republics of Centraland South America that the United States Government and its people haveonly the most friendly disposition toward them all. We do not covet theirterritory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in ourdealings with any of them, even the weakest. Our interests and our hopesfor them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their people andof the largest development of their great commercial resources. The mutualbenefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a more familiar andfriendly intercourse between our peoples we do desire, and in this havesought their friendly cooperation.I have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the greatestsincerity, that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injuriesinflicted upon our official representatives or upon our citizens. Thisinsistence, kindly and justly but firmly made, will, I believe, promotepeace and mutual respect.Our relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increasedinterest, and must continue to do so. I deem it of great importance thatthe projected submarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should bepromoted. Both for naval and commercial uses we should have quickcommunication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed ourselvesof the concession made many years ago to this Government for a harbor andnaval station at Pearl River. Many evidences of the friendliness of theHawaiian Government have been given in the past, and it is gratifying tobelieve that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very closerelations is appreciated.The friendly act of this Government in expressing to the Government ofItaly its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of Italian subjects inNew Orleans by the payment of 125,000 francs, or $24,330.90, was acceptedby the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious appreciation, andthe incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will.In consequence of the action of the French Government in proclaiming aprotectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africaeastward of the San Pedro River, which has long been regarded as thesoutheastern boundary of Liberia, I have felt constrained to make protestagainst this encroachment upon the territory of a Republic which wasrounded by citizens of the United States and toward which this country hasfor many years held the intimate relation of a friendly counselor.The recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders onthe Mexican frontier have afforded this Government an opportunity totestify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill theobligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the evildoers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of GuadalupeHidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably.Our intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret,however, not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claims ofthe American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponape, in theCaroline Islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view ofrenewed and urgent representations to the Government at Madrid.The treatment of the religious and educational establishments of Americancitizens in Turkey has of late called for a more than usual share ofattention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficiallyprevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest remonstrance ofthis Government. Harassing regulations in regard to schools and churcheshave been attempted in certain localities, but not without due protest andthe assertion of the inherent and conventional rights of our countrymen.Violations of domicile and search of the persons and effects of citizens ofthe United States by apparently irresponsible officials in the Asiaticvilayets have from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance ofinjury to the property of an American missionary at Bourdour, in theprovince of Konia, called forth an urgent claim for reparation, which I ampleased to say was promptly heeded by the Government of the Porte.Interference with the trading ventures of our citizens in Asia Minor isalso reported, and the lack of consular representation in that region is aserious drawback to instant and effective protection. I can not believethat these incidents represent a settled policy, and shall not cease tourge the adoption of proper remedies.International copyright has been extended to Italy by proclamation inconformity with the act of March 3, 1891, upon assurance being given thatItalian law permits to citizens of the United States the benefit ofcopyright on substantially the same basis as to subjects of Italy. By aspecial convention proclaimed January 15, 1892, reciprocal provisions ofcopyright have been applied between the United States and Germany.Negotiations are in progress with other countries to the same end.I repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which I have made inseveral previous messages that prompt and adequate support be given to theAmerican company engaged in the construction of the Nicaragua ship canal.It is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this greatenterprise, and I hope that there may be time, even in this Congress, togive to it an impetus that will insure the early completion of the canaland secure to the United States its proper relation to it when completed.The Congress has been already advised that the invitations of thisGovernment for the assembling of an international monetary conference toconsider the question of an enlarged use of silver were accepted by thenations to which they were addressed. The conference assembled at Brusselson the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration of thisgreat question. I have not doubted, and have taken occasion to express thatbelief as well in the invitations issued for this conference as in mypublic messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an agreedinternational ratio would greatly promote the interests of our people andequally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results maybe accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or delayintervenes, I believe that very soon commercial conditions will compel thenow reluctant governments to unite with us in this movement to secure theenlargement of the volume of coined money needed for the transaction of thebusiness of the world.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will attract especial interestin view of the many misleading statements that have been made as to thestate of the public revenues. Three preliminary facts should not only bestated but emphasized before looking into details: First, that the publicdebt has been reduced since March 4, 1889, $259,074,200, and the annualinterest charge $11,684,469; second, that there have been paid out forpensions during this Administration up to November 1, 1892,$432,564,178.70, an excess of $114,466,386.09 over the sum expended duringthe period from March 1, 1885, to March 1, 1889; and, third, that under theexisting tariff up to December 1 about $93,000,000 of revenue which wouldhave been collected upon imported sugars if the duty had been maintainedhas gone into the pockets of the people, and not into the public Treasury,as before. If there are any who still think that the surplus should havebeen kept out of circulation by hoarding it in the Treasury, or depositedin favored banks without interest while the Government continued to pay tothese very banks interest upon the bonds deposited as security for thedeposits, or who think that the extended pension legislation was a publicrobbery, or that the duties upon sugar should have been maintained, I amcontent to leave the argument where it now rests while we wait to seewhether these criticisms will take the form of legislation.The revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sourceswere $425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were$415,953,806.56, leaving a balance of $9,914,453.66. There were paid duringthe year upon the public debt $40,570,467.98. The surplus in the Treasuryand the bank redemption fund passed by the act of July 14, 1890, to thegeneral fund furnished in large part the cash available and used for thepayments made upon the public debt. Compared with the year 1891, ourreceipts from customs duties fell off $42,069,241.08, while our receiptsfrom internal revenue increased $8,284,823.13, leaving the net loss ofrevenue from these principal sources $33,784,417.95. The net loss ofrevenue from all sources was $32,675,972.81.The revenues, estimated and actual, for the fiscal year ending June 30,1893, are placed by the Secretary at $463,336,350.44, and the expendituresat $461,336,350.44, showing a surplus of receipts over expenditures of$2,000,000. The cash balance in the Treasury at the end of the fiscal yearit is estimated will be $20,992,377.03. So far as these figures are basedupon estimates of receipts and expenditures for the remaining months of thecurrent fiscal year, there are not only the usual elements of uncertainty,but some added elements. New revenue legislation, or even the expectationof it, may seriously reduce the public revenues during the period ofuncertainty and during the process of business adjustment to the newconditions when they become known. But the Secretary has very wiselyrefrained from guessing as to the effect of possible changes in our revenuelaws, since the scope of those changes and the time of their taking effectcan not in any degree be forecast or foretold by him. His estimates must bebased upon existing laws and upon a continuance of existing businessconditions, except so far as these conditions may be affected by causesother than new legislation.The estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, are$490,121,365.38, and the estimated appropriations $457,261,335.33, leavingan estimated surplus of receipts over expenditures of $32,860,030.05. Thisdoes not include any payment to the sinking fund. In the recommendation ofthe Secretary that the sinking fund law be repealed I concur. Theredemption of bonds since the passage of the law to June 30, 1892, hasalready exceeded the requirements by the sum of $990,510,681.49. Theretirement of bonds in the future before maturity should be a matter ofconvenience, not of compulsion. We should not collect revenue for thatpurpose, but only use any casual surplus. To the balance of $32,860,030.05of receipts over expenditures for the year 1894 should be added theestimated surplus at the beginning of the year, $20,992,377.03, and fromthis aggregate there must be deducted, as stated by the Secretary, about$44,000,000 of estimated unexpended appropriations.The public confidence in the purpose and ability of the Government tomaintain the parity of all of our money issues, whether coin or paper, mustremain unshaken. The demand for gold in Europe and the consequent callsupon us are in a considerable degree the result of the efforts of some ofthe European Governments to increase their gold reserves, and these effortsshould be met by appropriate legislation on our part. The conditions thathave created this drain of the Treasury gold are in an important degreepolitical, and not commercial. In view of the fact that a general revisionof our revenue laws in the near future seems to be probable, it would bebetter that any changes should be a part of that revision rather than of atemporary nature.During the last fiscal year the Secretary purchased under the act of July14, 1890, 54,355,748 ounces of silver and issued in payment therefor$51,106,608 in notes. The total purchases since the passage of the act havebeen 120,479,981 ounces and the aggregate of notes issued $116,783,590. Theaverage price paid for silver during the year was 94 cents per ounce, thehighest price being $1.02 3/4 July 1, 1891, and the lowest 83 cents March21, 1892. In view of the fact that the monetary conference is now sittingand that no conclusion has yet been reached, I withhold any recommendationas to legislation upon this subject.The report of the Secretary of War brings again to the attention ofCongress some important suggestions as to the reorganization of theinfantry and artillery arms of the service, which his predecessors havebefore urgently presented. Our Army is small, but its organization shouldall the more be put upon the most approved modern basis. The conditionsupon what we have called the "frontier" have heretofore required themaintenance of many small posts, but now the policy of concentration isobviously the right one. The new posts should have the proper strategicrelations to the only "frontiers" we now have those of the seacoast and ofour northern and part of our southern boundary. I do not think that anyquestion of advantage to localities or to States should determine thelocation of the new posts. The reorganization and enlargement of the Bureauof Military Information which the Secretary has effected is a work theusefulness of which will become every year more apparent. The work ofbuilding heavy guns and the construction of coast defenses has been wellbegun and should be carried on without check.The report of the Attorney General is by law submitted directly toCongress, but I can not refrain from saying that he has conducted theincreasing work of the Department of Justice with great professional skill.He has in several directions secured from the courts decisions givingincreased protection to the officers of the United States and bringing someclasses of crime that escaped local cognizance and punishment into thetribunals of the United States, where they could be tried withimpartiality.The numerous applications for Executive clemency presented in behalf ofpersons convicted in United States courts and given penitentiary sentenceshave called my attention to a fact referred to by the Attorney General inhis report, namely, that a time allowance for good behavior for suchprisoners is prescribed by the Federal statutes only where the State inwhich the penitentiary is located has made no such provision. Prisoners aregiven the benefit of the provisions of the State law regulating thepenitentiary to which they may be sent. These are various, some perhaps tooliberal and some perhaps too illiberal. The result is that a sentence forfive years means one thing if the prisoner is sent to one State forconfinement and quite a different thing if he is sent to another. Irecommend that a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribed byCongress.I have before expressed my concurrence in the recommendation of theAttorney General that degrees of murder should be recognized in the Federalstatutes, as they are, I believe, in all the States. These grades arerounded on correct distinctions in crime. The recognition of them wouldenable the courts to exercise some discretion in apportioning punishmentand would greatly relieve the Executive of what is coming to be a veryheavy burden the examination of these cases on application forcommutation.The aggregate of claims pending against the Government in the Court ofClaims is enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly $400,000,000 for thetaking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal duringthe war are now before that court for examination. When to these are addedthe Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation claims, anaggregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defense of all thesecases the Government is at great disadvantage. The claimants have preservedtheir evidence, whereas the agents of the Government are sent into thefield to rummage for what they can find. This difficulty is peculiarlygreat where the fact to be established is the disloyalty of the claimantduring the war. If this great threat against our revenues is to have noother check, certainly Congress should supply the Department of Justicewith appropriations sufficiently liberal to secure the best legal talent inthe defense of these claims and to pursue its vague search for evidenceeffectively.The report of the Postmaster General shows a most gratifying increase and amost efficient and progressive management of the great business of thatDepartment. The remarkable increase in revenues, in the number ofpost offices, and in the miles of mail carriage furnishes further evidenceof the high state of prosperity which our people are enjoying. New officesmean new hamlets and towns, new routes mean the extension of our bordersettlements, and increased revenues mean an active commerce. ThePostmaster General reviews the whole period of his administration of theoffice and brings some of his statistics down to the month of Novemberlast. The postal revenues have increased during the last year nearly$5,000,000. The deficit for the year ending June 30, 1892, is $848,341 lessthan the deficiency of the preceding year. The deficiency of the presentfiscal year it is estimated will be reduced to $1,552,423, which will notonly be extinguished during the next fiscal year but a surplus of nearly$1,000,000 should then be shown. In these calculations the payments to bemade under the contracts for ocean mail service have not been included.There have been added 1,590 new mail routes during the year, with a mileageof 8,563 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips addedduring the year is nearly 17,000,000. The number of miles of mail journeysadded during the last four years is about 76,000,000, this addition being21,000,000 miles more than were in operation in the whole country in 1861.The number of post offices has been increased by 2,790 during the year, andduring the past four years, and up to October 29 last, the total increasein the number of offices has been nearly 9,000. The number of free deliveryoffices has been nearly doubled in the last four years, and the number ofmoney order offices more than doubled within that time.For the three years ending June 30, 1892, the postal revenue amounted to$197,744,359, which was an increase of $52,263,150 over the revenue for thethree years ending June 30, 1888, the increase during the last three yearsbeing more than three and a half times as great as the increase during thethree years ending June 30, 1888. No such increase as that shown for thesethree years has ever previously appeared in the revenues of the Department.The Postmaster General has extended to the post offices in the largercities the merit system of promotion introduced by my direction into theDepartments here, and it has resulted there, as in the Departments, in alarger volume of work and that better done.Ever since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebelcruisers during the War of the Rebellion the United States has been payingan enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in the shape of freight andpassage moneys. Our grain and meats have been taken at our own docks andour large imports there laid down by foreign shipmasters. An increasingtorrent of American travel to Europe has contributed a vast sum annually tothe dividends of foreign shipowners. The balance of trade shown by thebooks of our custom houses has been very largely reduced and in many yearsaltogether extinguished by this constant drain. In the year 1892 only 12.3per cent of our imports were brought in American vessels. These greatforeign steamships maintained by our traffic are many of them undercontracts with their respective Governments by which in time of war theywill become a part of their armed naval establishments. Profiting by ourcommerce in peace, they will become the most formidable destroyers of ourcommerce in time of war. I have felt, and have before expressed thefeeling, that this condition of things was both intolerable anddisgraceful. A wholesome change of policy, and one having in it muchpromise, as it seems to me, was begun by the law of March 3, 1891. Underthis law contracts have been made by the Postmaster General for eleven mailroutes. The expenditure involved by these contracts for the next fiscalyear approximates $954,123.33. As one of the results already reachedsixteen American steamships, of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 tons,costing $7,400,000, have been built or contracted to be built in Americanshipyards.The estimated tonnage of all steamships required under existing contractsis 165,802, and when the full service required by these contracts isestablished there will be forty one mail steamers under the American flag,with the probability of further necessary additions in the Brazilian andArgentine service. The contracts recently let for transatlantic servicewill result in the construction of five ships of 10,000 tons each, costing$9,000,000 to $10,000,000, and will add, with the City of New York and Cityof Paris, to which the Treasury Department was authorized by legislation atthe last session to give American registry, seven of the swiftest vesselsupon the sea to our naval reserve. The contracts made with the linessailing to Central and South American ports have increased the frequencyand shortened the time of the trips, added new ports of call, and sustainedsome lines that otherwise would almost certainly have been withdrawn. Theservice to Buenos Ayres is the first to the Argentine Republic under theAmerican flag. The service to Southampton, Boulogne, and Antwerp is alsonew, and is to be begun with the steamships City of New York and City ofParis in February next.I earnestly urge the continuance of the policy inaugurated by thislegislation, and that the appropriations required to meet the obligationsof the Government under the contracts may be made promptly, so that thelines that have entered into these engagements may not be embarrassed. Wehave had, by reason of connections with the transcontinental railway linesconstructed through our own territory, some advantages in the ocean tradeof the Pacific that we did not possess on the Atlantic. The construction ofthe Canadian Pacific Railway and the establishment under large subventionsfrom Canada and England of fast steamship service from Vancouver with Japanand China seriously threaten our shipping interests in the Pacific. Thisline of English steamers receives, as is stated by the Commissioner ofNavigation, a direct subsidy of $400,000 annually, or $30,767 per trip forthirteen voyages, in addition to some further aid from the Admiralty inconnection with contracts under which the vessels may be used for navalpurposes. The competing American Pacific mail line under the act of March3, 1891, receives only $6,389 per round trip.Efforts have been making within the last year, as I am informed, toestablish under similar conditions a line between Vancouver and someAustralian port, with a view of seizing there a trade in which we have hada large interest. The Commissioner of Navigation states that a very largeper cent of our imports from Asia are now brought to us by Englishsteamships and their connecting railways in Canada. With a view ofpromoting this trade, especially in tea, Canada has imposed adiscriminating duty of 10 per cent upon tea and coffee brought into theDominion from the United States. If this unequal contest between Americanlines without subsidy, or with diminished subsidies, and the EnglishCanadian line to which I have referred is to continue, I think we should atleast see that the facilities for customs entry and transportation acrossour territory are not such as to make the Canadian route a favored one, andthat the discrimination as to duties to which I have referred is met by alike discrimination as to the importation of these articles from Canada.No subject, I think, more nearly touches the pride, the power, and theprosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchantmarine upon the sea. If we could enter into conference with othercompetitors and all would agree to withhold government aid, we couldperhaps take our chances with the rest; but our great competitors haveestablished and maintained their lines by government subsidies until theynow have practically excluded us from participation. In my opinion nochoice is left to us but to pursue, moderately at least, the same lines.The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits great progress in theconstruction of our new Navy. When the present Secretary entered upon hisduties, only 3 modern steel vessels were in commission. The vessels sinceput in commission and to be put in commission during the winter will make atotal of 19 during his administration of the Department. During the currentyear 10 war vessels and 3 navy tugs have been launched, and during the fouryears 25 vessels will have been launched. Two other large ships and atorpedo boat are under contract and the work upon them well advanced, andthe 4 monitors are awaiting only the arrival of their armor, which has beenunexpectedly delayed, or they would have been before this in commission.Contracts have been let during this Administration, under theappropriations for the increase of the Navy, including new vessels andtheir appurtenances, to the amount of $35,000,000, and there has beenexpended during the same period for labor at navy yards upon similar work$8,000,000 without the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or partiality.The enthusiasm and interest of our naval officers, both of the staff andline, have been greatly kindled. They have responded magnificently to theconfidence of Congress and have demonstrated to the world an unexcelledcapacity in construction, in ordnance, and in everything involved in thebuilding, equipping, and sailing of great war ships.At the beginning of Secretary Tracy\'s administration several difficultproblems remained to be grappled with and solved before the efficiency inaction of our ships could be secured. It is believed that as the result ofnew processes in the construction of armor plate our later ships will beclothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power than are found onany war vessels afloat. We were without torpedoes. Tests have been made toascertain the relative efficiency of different constructions, a torpedo hasbeen adopted, and the work of construction is now being carried onsuccessfully. We were without armor piercing shells and without a shopinstructed and equipped for the construction of them. We are now makingwhat is believed to be a projectile superior to any before in use. Asmokeless powder has been developed and a slow burning powder for guns oflarge caliber. A high explosive capable of use in shells fired from serviceguns has been found, and the manufacture of gun cotton has been developedso that the question of supply is no longer in doubt.The development of a naval militia, which has been organized in eightStates and brought into cordial and cooperative relations with the Navy, isanother important achievement. There are now enlisted in theseorganizations 1,800 men, and they are likely to be greatly extended. Irecommend such legislation and appropriations as will encourage and developthis movement. The recommendations of the Secretary will, I do not doubt,receive the friendly consideration of Congress, for he has enjoyed, as hehas deserved, the confidence of all those interested in the development ofour Navy, without any division upon partisan lines. I earnestly express thehope that a work which has made such noble progress may not now be stayed.The wholesome influence for peace and the increased sense of security whichour citizens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent shipsunder the American flag appear is already most gratefully apparent. Theships from our Navy which will appear in the great naval parade next Aprilin the harbor of New York will be a convincing demonstration to the worldthat the United States is again a naval power.The work of the Interior Department, always very burdensome, has beenlarger than ever before during the administration of Secretary Noble. Thedisability pension law, the taking of the Eleventh Census, the opening ofvast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, andthe negotiations for the cession of Indian lands furnish some of theparticulars of the increased work, and the results achieved testify to theability, fidelity, and industry of the head of the Department and hisefficient assistants.Several important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated bythe commission appointed under the act of March 2, 1889, are awaiting theaction of Congress. Perhaps the most important of these is that for thecession of the Cherokee Strip. This region has been the source of greatvexation to the executive department and of great friction and unrestbetween the settlers who desire to occupy it and the Indians who asserttitle. The agreement which has been made by the commission is perhaps themost satisfactory that could have been reached. It will be noticed that itis conditioned upon its ratification by Congress before March 4, 1893. TheSecretary of the Interior, who has given the subject very careful thought,recommends the ratification of the agreement, and I am inclined to followhis recommendation. Certain it is that some action by which thiscontroversy shall be brought to an end and these lands opened to settlementis urgent.The form of government provided by Congress on May 17, 1884, for Alaska wasin its frame and purpose temporary. The increase of population and thedevelopment of some important mining and commercial interests make itimperative that the law should be revised and better provision made for thearrest and punishment of criminals.The report of the Secretary shows a very gratifying state of facts as tothe condition of the General Land Office. The work of issuing agriculturalpatents, which seemed to be hopelessly in arrear when the present Secretaryundertook the duties of his office, has been so expedited that the bureauis now upon current business. The relief thus afforded to honest and worthysettlers upon the public lands by giving to them an assured title to theirentries has been of incalculable benefit in developing the new States andthe Territories.The Court of Private Land Claims, established by Congress for the promotionof this policy of speedily settling contested land titles, is makingsatisfactory progress in its work, and when the work is completed a greatimpetus will be given to the development of those regions where unsettledclaims under Mexican grants have so long exercised their repressiveinfluence. When to these results are added the enormous cessions of Indianlands which have been opened to settlement, aggregating during thisAdministration nearly 26,000,000 acres, and the agreements negotiated andnow pending in Congress for ratification by which about 10,000,000additional acres will be opened to settlement, it will be seen how much hasbeen accomplished.The work in the Indian Bureau in the execution of the policy of recentlegislation has been largely directed to two chief purposes: First, theallotment of lands in severalty to the Indians and the cession to theUnited States of the surplus lands, and, secondly, to the work of educatingthe Indian for his own protection in his closer contact with the white manand for the intelligent exercise of his new citizenship. Allotments havebeen made and patents issued to 5,900 Indians under the present Secretaryand Commissioner, and 7,600 additional allotments have been made for whichpatents are now in process of preparation. The school attendance of Indianchildren has been increased during that time over 13 per cent, theenrollment for 1892 being nearly 20,000. A uniform system of schooltext books and of study has been adopted and the work in these nationalschools brought as near as may be to the basis of the free common schoolsof the States. These schools can be transferred and merged into thecommon school systems of the States when the Indian has fully assumed hisnew relation to the organized civil community in which he resides and thenew States are able to assume the burden. I have several times been calledupon to remove Indian agents appointed by me, and have done so promptlyupon every sustained complaint of unfitness or misconduct. I believe,however, that the Indian service at the agencies has been improved and isnow administered on the whole with a good degree of efficiency. If anylegislation is possible by which the selection of Indian agents can bewholly removed from all partisan suggestions or considerations, I am sureit would be a great relief to the Executive and a great benefit to theservice. The appropriation for the subsistence of the Cheyenne and ArapahoeIndians made at the last session of Congress was inadequate. This smallerappropriation was estimated for by the Commissioner upon the theory thatthe large fund belonging to the tribe in the public Treasury could be andought to be used for their support. In view, however, of the pendingdepredation claims against this fund and other considerations, theSecretary of the Interior on the 12th of April last submitted asupplemental estimate for $50,000. This appropriation was not made, as itshould have been, and the oversight ought to be remedied at the earliestpossible date.In a special message to this Congress at the last session, I stated thereasons why I had not approved the deed for the release to the UnitedStates by the Choctaws and Chickasaws of the lands formerly embraced in theCheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation and remaining after allotments to thattribe. A resolution of the Senate expressing the opinion of that body thatnotwithstanding the facts stated in my special message the deed should beapproved and the money, $2,991,450, paid over was presented to me May 10,1892. My special message was intended to call the attention of Congress tothe subject, and in view of the fact that it is conceded that theappropriation proceeded upon a false basis as to the amount of lands to bepaid for and is by $50,000 in excess of the amount they are entitled to(even if their claim to the land is given full recognition at the rateagreed upon), I have not felt willing to approve the deed, and shall not doso, at least until both Houses of Congress have acted upon the subject. Ithas been informally proposed by the claimants to release this sum of$50,000, but I have no power to demand or accept such a release, and suchan agreement would be without consideration and void.I desire further to call the attention of Congress to the fact that therecent agreement concluded with the Kiowas and Comanches relates to landswhich were a part of the "leased district," and to which the claim of theChoctaws and Chickasaws is precisely that recognized by Congress in thelegislation I have referred to. The surplus lands to which this claim wouldattach in the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation is 2,500,000 acres, and at thesame rate the Government will be called upon to pay to the Choctaws andChickasaws for these lands $3,125,000. This sum will be further augmented,especially if the title of the Indians to the tract now Greet County, Tex.,is established. The duty devolved upon me in this connection was simply topass upon the form of the deed; but as in my opinion the facts mentioned inmy special message were not adequately brought to the attention of Congressin connection with the legislation, I have felt that I would not bejustified in acting without some new expression of the legislative will.The report of the Commissioner of Pensions, to which extended notice isgiven by the Secretary of the Interior in his report, will attract greatattention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done, the last year hasbeen the greatest in the history of the office. I believe that theorganization of the office is efficient and that the work has been donewith fidelity. The passage of what is known as the disability bill has, aswas foreseen, very largely increased the annual disbursements to thedisabled veterans of the Civil War. The estimate for this fiscal year was$144,956,000, and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency amounting to$10,508,621 must be provided for at this session. The estimate for pensionsfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, is $165,000,000. The Commissionerof Pensions believes that if the present legislation and methods aremaintained and further additions to the pension laws are not made themaximum expenditure for pensions will be reached June 30, 1894, and will beat the highest point $188,000,000 per annum.I adhere to the views expressed in previous messages that the care of thedisabled soldiers of the War of the Rebellion is a matter of nationalconcern and duty. Perhaps no emotion cools sooner than that of gratitude,but I can not believe that this process has yet reached a point with ourpeople that would sustain the policy of remitting the care of thesedisabled veterans to the inadequate agencies provided by local laws. Theparade on the 20th of September last upon the streets of this capital of60,000 of the surviving Union veterans of the War of the Rebellion was amost touching and thrilling episode, and the rich and gracious welcomeextended to them by the District of Columbia and the applause that greetedtheir progress from tens of thousands of people from all the States didmuch to revive the glorious recollections of the Grand Review when thesemen and many thousand others now in their graves were welcomed withgrateful joy as victors in a struggle in which the national unity, honor,and wealth were all at issue.In my last annual message I called attention to the fact that somelegislative action was necessary in order to protect the interests of theGovernment in its relations with the Union Pacific Railway. TheCommissioner of Railroads has submitted a very full report, giving exactinformation as to the debt, the liens upon the company\'s property, and itsresources. We must deal with the question as we find it and take thatcourse which will under existing conditions best secure the interests ofthe United States. I recommended in my last annual message that acommission be appointed to deal with this question, and I renew thatrecommendation and suggest that the commission be given full power.The report of the Secretary of Agriculture contains not only a mostinteresting statement of the progressive and valuable work done under theadministration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the enlargedusefulness of this important Department. In the successful efforts to breakdown the restrictions to the free introduction of our meat products in thecountries of Europe the Secretary has been untiring from the first,stimulating and aiding all other Government officers at home and abroadwhose official duties enabled them to participate in the work. The totaltrade in hog products with Europe in May, 1892, amounted to 82,000,000pounds, against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891; in June, 1892, theexport aggregated 85,700,000 pounds, against 46,500,000 pounds in the samemonth of the previous year; in July there was an increase of 41 per centand in August of 55 per cent over the corresponding months of 1891. Over40,000,000 pounds of inspected pork have been exported since the law wasput into operation, and a comparison of the four months of May, June, July,and August, 1892, with the same months of 1891 shows an increase in thenumber of pounds of our export of pork products of 62 per cent and anincrease in value of 66 1/2 per cent. The exports of dressed beef increasedfrom 137,900,000 pounds in 1889 to 220,500,000 pounds in 1892 or about 60per cent. During the past year there have been exported 394,607 head oflive cattle, as against 205,786 exported in 1889. This increasedexportation has been largely promoted by the inspection authorized by lawand the faithful efforts of the Secretary and his efficient subordinates tomake that inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargoesdiseased or suspected cattle. The requirement of the English regulationsthat live cattle arriving from the United States must be slaughtered at thedocks had its origin in the claim that pleuro pneumonia existed amongAmerican cattle and that the existence of the disease could only certainlybe determined by a post mortem inspection.The Department of Agriculture has labored with great energy andfaithfulness to extirpate this disease, and on the 26th day of Septemberlast a public announcement was made by the Secretary that the disease nolonger existed anywhere within the United States. He is entirely satisfiedafter the most searching inquiry that this statement was justified, andthat by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine now required ofcattle brought into this country the disease can be prevented from againgetting any foothold. The value to the cattle industry of the United Statesof this achievement can hardly be estimated. We can not, perhaps, at onceinsist that this evidence shall be accepted as satisfactory by othercountries; but if the present exemption from the disease is maintained andthe inspection of our cattle arriving at foreign ports, in which our ownveterinarians participate, confirms it, we may justly expect that therequirement that our cattle shall be slaughtered at the docks will berevoked, as the sanitary restrictions upon our pork products have been. Ifour cattle can be taken alive to the interior, the trade will be enormouslyincreased.Agricultural products constituted 78.1 per cent of our unprecedentedexports for the fiscal year which closed June 30, 1892, the total exportsbeing $1,030,278,030 and the value of the agricultural products$793,717,676, which exceeds by more than $150,000,000 the shipment ofagricultural products in any previous year.An interesting and a promising work for the benefit of the American farmerhas been begun through agents of the Agricultural Department in Europe, andconsists in efforts to introduce the various products of Indian corn asarticles of human food. The high price of rye offered a favorableopportunity for the experiment in Germany of combining corn meal with ryeto produce a cheaper bread. A fair degree of success has been attained, andsome mills for grinding corn for food have been introduced. The Secretaryis of the opinion that this new use of the products of corn has alreadystimulated exportations, and that if diligently prosecuted large andimportant markets can presently be opened for this great American product.The suggestions of the Secretary for an enlargement of the work of theDepartment are commended to your favorable consideration. It may, I think,be said without challenge that in no corresponding period has so much beendone as during the last four years for the benefit of Americanagriculture.The subject of quarantine regulations, inspection, and control was broughtsuddenly to my attention by the arrival at our ports in August last ofvessels infected with cholera. Quarantine regulations should be uniform atall our ports. Under the Constitution they are plainly within the exclusiveFederal jurisdiction when and so far as Congress shall legislate. In myopinion the whole subject should be taken into national control andadequate power given to the Executive to protect our people against plagueinvasions. On the 1st of September last I approved regulations establishinga twenty day quarantine for all vessels bringing immigrants from foreignports. This order will be continued in force. Some loss and suffering haveresulted to passengers, but a due care for the homes of our peoplejustifies in such cases the utmost precaution. There is danger that withthe coming of spring cholera will again appear, and a liberal appropriationshould be made at this session to enable our quarantine and port officersto exclude the deadly plague.But the most careful and stringent quarantine regulations may not besufficient absolutely to exclude the disease. The progress of medical andsanitary science has been such, however, that if approved precautions aretaken at once to put all of our cities and towns in the best sanitarycondition, and provision is made for isolating any sporadic cases and for athorough disinfection, an epidemic can, I am sure, be avoided. This workappertains to the local authorities, and the responsibility and the penaltywill be appalling if it is neglected or unduly delayed.We are peculiarly subject in our great ports to the spread of infectiousdiseases by reason of the fact that unrestricted immigration brings to usout of European cities, in the overcrowded steerages of great steamships, alarge number of persons whose surroundings make them the easy victims ofthe plague. This consideration, as well as those affecting the political,moral, and industrial interests of our country, leads me to renew thesuggestion that admission to our country and to the high privileges of itscitizenship should be more restricted and more careful. We have, I think, aright and owe a duty to our own people, and especially to our workingpeople, not only to keep out the vicious, the ignorant, the civildisturber, the pauper, and the contract laborer, but to check the too greatflow of immigration now coming by further limitations.The report of the World\'s Columbian Exposition has not yet been submitted.That of the board of management of the Government exhibit has been receivedand is herewith transmitted. The work of construction and of preparationfor the opening of the exposition in May next has progressed mostsatisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that willworthily sustain the honor of the United States.The District of Columbia is left by a decision of the supreme court of theDistrict without any law regulating the liquor traffic. An old statute ofthe legislature of the District relating to the licensing of variousvocations has hitherto been treated by the Commissioners as giving thempower to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors and assubjecting those who sold without licenses to penalties; but in May lastthe supreme court of the District held against this view of the powers ofthe Commissioners. It is of urgent importance, therefore, that Congressshould supply, either by direct enactment or by conferring discretionarypowers upon the Commissioners, proper limitations and restraints upon theliquor traffic in the District. The District has suffered in its reputationby many crimes of violence, a large per cent of them resulting fromdrunkenness and the liquor traffic. The capital of the nation should befreed from this reproach by the enactment of stringent restrictions andlimitations upon the traffic.In renewing the recommendation which I have made in three preceding annualmessages that Congress should legislate for the protection of railroademployees against the dangers incident to the old and inadequate methods ofbraking and coupling which are still in use upon freight trains, I do sowith the hope that this Congress may take action upon the subject.Statistics furnished by the Interstate Commerce Commission show that duringthe year ending June 30, 1891, there were forty seven different styles ofcar couplers reported to be in use, and that during the same period therewere 2,660 employees killed and 26,140 injured. Nearly 16 per cent of thedeaths occurred in the coupling and uncoupling of cars and over 36 per centof the injuries had the same origin.The Civil Service Commission ask for an increased appropriation for neededclerical assistance, which I think should be given. I extended theclassified service March 1, 1892, to include physicians, superintendents,assistant superintendents, school teachers, and matrons in the Indianservice, and have had under consideration the subject of some furtherextensions, but have not as yet fully determined the lines upon whichextensions can most properly and usefully be made.I have in each of the three annual messages which it has been my duty tosubmit to Congress called attention to the evils and dangers connected withour election methods and practices as they are related to the choice ofofficers of the National Government. In my last annual message I endeavoredto invoke serious attention to the evils of unfair apportionments forCongress. I can not close this message without again calling attention tothese grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that it was possible tosecure a nonpartisan inquiry by means of a commission into evils theexistence of which is known to all, and that out of this might growlegislation from which all thought of partisan advantage should beeliminated and only the higher thought appear of maintaining the freedomand purity of the ballot and the equality of the elector, without theguaranty of which the Government could never have been formed and withoutthe continuance of which it can not continue to exist in peace andprosperity.It is time that mutual charges of unfairness and fraud between the greatparties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a desirefor pure and honest elections should be brought to the test of theirwillingness to free our legislation and our election methods fromeverything that tends to impair the public confidence in the announcedresult. The necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by Congress uponthis subject is emphasized by the fact that the tendency of the legislationin some States in recent years has in some important particulars been awayfrom and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. Is itnot time that we should come together upon the high plane of patriotismwhile we devise methods that shall secure the right of every man qualifiedby law to cast a free ballot and give to every such ballot an equal valuein choosing our public officers and in directing the policy of theGovernment?Lawlessness is not less such, but more, where it usurps the functions ofthe peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynching of coloredpeople accused of crime is without the excuse, which has sometimes beenurged by mobs for a failure to pursue the appointed methods for thepunishment of crime, that the accused have an undue influence over courtsand juries. Such acts are a reproach to the community where they occur, andso far as they can be made the subject of Federal jurisdiction thestrongest repressive legislation is demanded. A public sentiment that willsustain the officers of the law in resisting mobs and in protecting accusedpersons in their custody should be promoted by every possible means. Theofficer who gives his life in the brave discharge of this duty is worthy ofspecial honor. No lesson needs to be so urgently impressed upon our peopleas this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness.This exhibit of the work of the Executive Departments is submitted toCongress and to the public in the hope that there will be found in it a duesense of responsibility and an earnest purpose to maintain the nationalhonor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of all our people, andthis brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the country will give usa level from which to note the increase or decadence that new legislativepolicies may bring to us. There is no reason why the national influence,power, and prosperity should not observe the same rates of increase thathave characterized the past thirty years. We carry the great impulse andincrease of these years into the future. There is no reason why in manylines of production we should not surpass all other nations, as we havealready done in some. There are no near frontiers to our possibledevelopment. Retrogression would be a crime.
William McKinley
To the Senate and House of Representatives:It gives me pleasure to extend greeting to the Fifty fifth Congress,assembled in regular session at the seat of Government, with many of whoseSenators and Representatives I have been associated in the legislativeservice. Their meeting occurs under felicitous conditions, justifyingsincere congratulation and calling for our grateful acknowledgment to abeneficent Providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as anation. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continueunbroken.A matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regardand unification of all sections of our country, the incompleteness of whichhas too long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. Thespirit of patriotism is universal and is ever increasing in fervor. Thepublic questions which now most engross us are lifted far above eitherpartisanship, prejudice, or former sectional differences. They affect everypart of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancientlines. Questions of foreign policy, of revenue, the soundness of thecurrency, the inviolability of national obligations, the improvement of thepublic service, appeal to the individual conscience of every earnestcitizen to whatever party he belongs or in whatever section of the countryhe may reside.The extra session of this Congress which closed during July last enactedimportant legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized,what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom.To test its permanent value further time will be required, and the people,satisfied with its operation and results thus far, are in no mind towithhold from it a fair trial.Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress,the question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency.The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it mayseem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of theGovernment since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year we hadoutstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $728,868,447.41. On the 1st ofJanuary, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to $443,889,495.88. Of ourinterest bearing obligations, the figures are even more striking. On July1, 1866, the principal of the interest bearing debt of the Government was$2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July, 1893, this sum had been reduced to$585,137,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. Theinterest bearing debt of the United States on the 1st day of December,1897, was $847,365,620. The Government money now outstanding (December 1)consists of $346,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of Treasurynotes issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,963,504 of silvercertificates, and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.With the great resources of the Government, and with the honorable exampleof the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currencyrevision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to theGovernment and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt.The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to1893, makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of ourfinancial ability or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897 mustadmonish Congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as to makethe return of the conditions then prevailing impossible.There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can findthe true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that ourcurrency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; goodbecause the Government\'s pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge willnot be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge willbe best shown by advancing toward its fulfillment.The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the Governmentof maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is, keepingall of them at par with gold. We surely cannot be longer heedless of theburden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperousconditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not onlyan expensive charge upon the Government, but a dangerous menace to theNational credit.It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the Governmentagainst bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail theopportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of ourdemand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. Wehave $900,000,000 of currency which the Government by solemn enactment hasundertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in goldbut the Government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. TheGovernment is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currencyand coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid ingold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, and the only means bywhich the Government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It canget it in no other way when it most needs it. The Government without anyfixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it hassteadily and faithfully done, and which, under the authority now given, itwill continue to do.The law which requires the Government, after having redeemed its UnitedStates notes, to pay them out again as current funds, demands a constantreplenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so in times ofbusiness panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expensesof the Government. At such times the Government has no other way to supplyits deficit and maintain redemption but through the increase of its bondeddebt, as during the Administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 offour and a half per cent bonds were issued and sold and the proceeds usedto pay the expenses of the Government in excess of the revenues and sustainthe gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part of the proceeds ofthese bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable portionwas required to maintain the gold reserve.With our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficitrequiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below$100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds? Isthere any other way practicable under existing law? The serious questionthen is, Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past;that is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue morebonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means toprevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no furtherlegislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, thenCongress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bondsat long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is nowauthorized by law.I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the Government are quitesufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, that when any of theUnited States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemedin gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out inexchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the UnitedStates note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government, he should notreceive back from the Government a United States note without paying goldin exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent whenthe Government issues an interest bearing debt to provide gold for theredemption of United States notes a non interest bearing debt. Surely itshould not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they areput out in any other way, they may return again to be followed by anotherbond issue to redeem them another interest bearing debt to redeem anon interest bearing debt.In my view, it is of the utmost importance that the Government should berelieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchangesand export. This responsibility is alone borne by the Government, withoutany of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks donot feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon theGovernment, and the size of the gold reserve in the Treasury has come tobe, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This oughtto be stopped.If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficientreceipts for the expenses of the Government, we may feel no immediateembarrassment from our present currency; but the danger still exists, andwill be ever present, menacing us so long as the existing system continues.And, besides, it is in times of adequate revenues and business tranquillitythat the Government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid, withoutserious consequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of thisquestion.The Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan, in great detail, for thepurpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserveand save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan Iinvite your careful consideration.I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in his recommendation thatNational banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bondswhich they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulatingnotes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one half of one percent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given forthe establishment of National banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. Thiswill enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country tobe supplied with currency to meet their needs.I recommend that the issue of National bank notes be restricted to thedenomination of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have hereinmade shall have the approval of Congress, then I would recommend thatNational banks be required to redeem their notes in gold.The most important problem with which this Government is now called upon todeal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain andthe Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common withthose now existing have confronted this Government at various times in thepast. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest, growingdiscontent, an effort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty andself control, of organized resistance to the mother country, of depressionafter distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlement to be followed byrenewed revolt. For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of thecontinental possessions of Spain in the Western Continent has the conditionof Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern to the UnitedStates.The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain\'s hold upon theisland and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the homeGovernment might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power calledforth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declarations of the policy ofthe United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba\'s connection with Spainunless in the direction of independence or acquisition by us throughpurchase, nor has there been any change of this declared policy since uponthe part of the Government.The revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite thestrenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it.Then as now the Government of the United States testified its grave concernand offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures madeby General Grant were refused and the war dragged on, entailing great lossof life and treasure and increased injury to American interests, besidesthrowing enhanced burdens of neutrality upon this Government. In 1878 peacewas brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations betweenthe Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders.The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my purposeat this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize itstenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed against it bySpain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to everyquarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the effortsof Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has beendisregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.The existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the Americanpeople with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of ourpeople to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire tosee the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure ofself control which is the inalienable right of man, protected in theirright to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of their country.The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendlyoffices of this Government, failed. Any mediation on our part was notaccepted. In brief, the answer read: "There is no effectual way to pacifyCuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels to themother country." Then only could Spain act in the promised direction, ofher own motion and after her own plans.The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. Theproductive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. Theagricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, theirlands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy the latecabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means ofcutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly failed as a warmeasure. It was not civilized warfare. It was extermination.Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on repeatedoccasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this Government. Therewas much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens byalleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pendingprotracted judicial proceedings. I felt it my first duty to make instantdemand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens underarrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet in October last twenty twoprisoners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom.For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict theaid of Congress was sought in a special message, and under theappropriation of May 24, 1897, effective aid has been given to Americancitizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been returned tothe United States.The instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departurefor his post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere wishof the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cubaby reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike toSpain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the character andduration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, the burdens andrestraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance of nationalinterests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of thisstate of things. It was stated that at this juncture our Government wasconstrained to seriously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain of herown volition, moved by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity,should put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlementhonorable to herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that as aneighboring nation, with large interests in Cuba, we could be required towait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish itsauthority and restore peace and order within the borders of the island;that we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishmentof this result.No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation toSpain could attach, and, indeed, precise proposals were withheld to avoidembarrassment to that Government. All that was asked or expected was thatsome safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace restored. Itso chanced that the consideration of this offer, addressed to the sameSpanish administration which had declined the tenders of my predecessor,and which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba inthe fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell to others. Between thedeparture of General Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain thestatesman who had shaped the policy of his country fell by the hand of anassassin, and although the cabinet of the late premier still held officeand received from our envoy the proposals he bore, that cabinet gave placewithin a few days thereafter to a new administration, under the leadershipof Sagasta.The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in thedirection of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly purposesof this Government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by thewar in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that thepresent Spanish government is bound by every consideration to a change ofpolicy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within areasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into effect thepolitical reforms heretofore advocated by the present premier, withouthalting for any consideration in the path which in its judgment leads topeace. The military operations, it is said, will continue, but will behumane and conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompaniedby political action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanishsovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with adistinct personality, the island to be governed by an executive and by alocal council or chamber, reserving to Spain the control of the foreignrelations, the army and navy, and the judicial administration. Toaccomplish this the present government proposes to modify existinglegislation by decree, leaving the Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cubansenators and deputies, to solve the economic problem and properlydistribute the existing debt.In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Governmentproposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it suggeststhat Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant politicalreforms, while the United States for its part shall enforce its neutralobligations and cut off the assistance which it is asserted the insurgentsreceive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolongation ofthe war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are alreadywell nigh reclaimed, that the planting of cane and tobacco therein has beenresumed, and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early andcomplete pacification is hoped for.The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the newadministration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal thedisturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of theUnited States. Discussion of the question of the international duties andresponsibilities of the United States as Spain understands them ispresented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with failure in thisregard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It could not have beenmade if Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this Governmenthas made, at the cost of millions and by the employment of theadministrative machinery of the nation at command, to perform its full dutyaccording to the law of nations. That it has successfully prevented thedeparture of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shoresin violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of thisaspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now. Firmin the conviction of a wholly performed obligation, due response to thischarge has been made in diplomatic course.Throughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this Governmenthas never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of reserving toitself the determination of its policy and course according to its own highsense of right and in consonance with the dearest interests and convictionsof our own people should the prolongation of the strife so demand.Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents asbelligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral interventionto end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants,and intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not offorcible annexation, for that can not be thought of. That, by our code ofmorality, would be criminal aggression.Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often beencanvassed as a possible, if not inevitable, step both in regard to theprevious ten years\' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindfulthat the two Houses of Congress in the spring of 1896 expressed the opinionby concurrent resolution that a condition of public war existed requiringor justifying the recognition of a state of belligerency in Cuba, andduring the extra session the Senate voted a joint resolution of likeimport, which, however, was not brought to a vote in the House ofRepresentatives. In the presence of these significant expressions of thesentiment of the legislative branch it behooves the Executive to soberlyconsider the conditions under which so important a measure must needs restfor justification. It is to be seriously considered whether the Cubaninsurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, whichalone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession,in short, of the essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgentsand the conduct of the war by them according to the received code of warare no less important factors toward the determination of the problem ofbelligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle uponthe internal polity of the recognizing state.The wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of December7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba, and it maybe wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous conflict had forseven years wasted the neighboring island. During all those years an utterdisregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands ofhumanity, which called forth expressions of condemnation from the nationsof Christendom, continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded thatproductive region, enormously affecting the commerce of all commercialnations, but that of the United States more than any other by reason ofproximity and larger trade and intercourse. At that juncture General Grantuttered these words, which now, as then, sum up the elements of theproblem: A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself isthat of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to thecontest.In a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question,and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful anddevastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity ofwar. It is possible that the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spainherself, of this very nature, might be pointed to in defense of suchrecognition. But now, as in its past history, the United States shouldcarefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into the mazes ofdoubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternlyto the rule, which has been its guide, of doing only that which is rightand honest and of good report. The question of according or of withholdingrights of belligerency must be judged in every case in view of theparticular attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always,and justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration ofmoral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, whenthe interests and rights of another government or of its people are so faraffected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of itsrelations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which willbe recognized in the sense of international law as war. Belligerence, too,is a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and theiroccasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to.Applying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognizedby publicists and writers on international law, and which have beenobserved by nations of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitiveor selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection theexistence of such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, andmanifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinaryfunctions of government toward its own people and to other states, withcourts for the administration of justice, with a local habitation,possessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation ofterritory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebelliousinsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footingof war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it. Thecontest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possesseditself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag, nor has itany means of communication with foreign powers except through the militarylines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden anddifficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitateupon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consularofficers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to theparties to the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regardthe accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature asI regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right. Suchrecognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow fromit difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from thecontending parties of the strict observance of their rights andobligations. It confers the right of search upon the high seas by vesselsof both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions ofwar, which now may be transported freely and without interruption in thevessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure; itwould give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the parentGovernment from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents, and wouldinvest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by ourtreaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas, a very large part ofwhich, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and betweenall of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through the waters whichwash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could scarce failto lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peacefulrelations of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result suchsupervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of theUnited States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures ofquestionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Turning to thepractical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing itsinconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerationsappear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a nakedrecognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the assumption ofinternational neutrality. Such recognition, without more, will not conferupon either party to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actuallypossessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The actof recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation ofneutrality, which recites the de facto condition of belligerency as itsmotive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality in the declaring state.It assumes the international obligations of a neutral in the presence of apublic state of war. It warns all citizens and others within thejurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorousobligations at their own peril and can not expect to be shielded from theconsequences. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure ofvessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiraltylaw must under international law be admitted as a legitimate consequence ofa proclamation of belligerency. While according the equal belligerentrights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors would beimposed on both, which, while nominally equal, would weigh heavily inbehalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports ofCuba, her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the militaryinvestment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorialwaters, and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans withintheir own domain could not hope to create a parallel, while its creationthrough aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even moreimpossible than now, with the additional obligations of internationalneutrality we would perforce assume.The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would onlybe influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicableby our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States nojurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the UnitedStates no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife withinthe paramount authority of Spain according to the international code ofwar.For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cubaninsurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that stephereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the Executive willtake it.Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested andhas not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. Butshould such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful changehas supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government hastaken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to thedeclaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintainpeace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of reform aftersubjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that with asubstitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfarefor one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer aim to drivethe Cubans to the "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket orsuccumbing in misery;" that reforms must be instituted in accordance withthe needs and circumstances of the time, and that these reforms, whiledesigned to give full autonomy to the colony and to create a virtual entityand self controlled administration, shall yet conserve and affirm thesovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and burdens upon abasis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency.The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. Thepolicy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universalsentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander abroad clemency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot torelieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it isasserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protectthe resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuits and productive industries.That past methods are futile to force a peace by subjugation is freelyadmitted, and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to winfor Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency.Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already beenpromulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but asfurnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil andelectoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existingconstitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. Ascheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective uponratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which, with theinsular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects affecting localorder and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as to matters ofstate, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor General acts by his ownauthority as the delegate of the central Government. This parliamentreceives the oath of the Governor General to preserve faithfully theliberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the colonial secretariesare responsible. It has the right to propose to the central Government,through the Governor General, modifications of the national charter and toinvite new projects of law or executive measures in the interest of thecolony.Besides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoralregistration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors andthe manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of justicewith native judges from members of the local bar; third, to frame theinsular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without limitation ofany kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban share of thenational budget, which latter will be voted by the national Cortes with theassistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to initiate or take partin the negotiations of the national Government for commercial treatieswhich may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept or reject commercialtreaties which the national Government may have concluded without theparticipation of the Cuban government; sixth, to frame the colonial tariff,acting in accord with the peninsular Government in scheduling articles ofmutual commerce between the mother country and the colonies. Beforeintroducing or voting upon a bill the Cuban government or the chambers willlay the project before the central Government and hear its opinion thereon,all the correspondence in such regard being made public. Finally, allconflicts of jurisdiction arising between the different municipal,provincial, and insular assemblies, or between the latter and the insularexecutive power, and which from their nature may not be referable to thecentral Government for decision, shall be submitted to the courts.That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from whichrecession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in thefew weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of itsprofessions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor shouldimpatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken. It ishonestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that sheshould be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and toprove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she standsirrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose brutal ordersinflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She hasmodified the horrible order of concentration and has undertaken to care forthe helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of theirfields to do so, and assures them of the protection of the SpanishGovernment in their lawful occupations. She has just released theCompetitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to death, and who have been thesubject of repeated diplomatic correspondence during both this and thepreceding Administration.Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba ofwhom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstratewhether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to theCubans and to Spain as well as equitable to all our interests so intimatelyinvolved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, theexigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to betaken. When that time comes that action will be determined in the line ofindisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving orhesitancy in the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, tothe people who have confided to it the protection of their interests andhonor, and to humanity.Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated onlyby upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion norselfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over the rightsand property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts tobring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable andenduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by ourobligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene withforce, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessityfor such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval ofthe civilized world.By a special message dated the 16th day of June last, I laid before theSenate a treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the UnitedStates and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose theincorporation of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the UnitedStates and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the injunctionof secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, thesubject may be properly referred to in this Message because the necessaryaction of the Congress is required to determine by legislation many detailsof the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as Ibelieve it should be.While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressivepolicy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series ofdeclarations through three quarters of a century has proclaimed the vitalinterest of the United States in the independent life of the Islands andtheir intimate commercial dependence upon this country. At the same time ithas been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiianstatehood cease by the passage of the Islands under the domination orinfluence of another power than the United States. Under thesecircumstances, the logic of events required that annexation, heretoforeoffered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about as thenatural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to those Islands, andbe realized by the free will of the Hawaiian State.That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the Senate andPresident of the Republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and onlyawaits the favorable action of the American Senate to effect the completeabsorption of the Islands into the domain of the United States. What theconditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to theUnited States, the character of the local administration, the quality anddegree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of thefederal laws to the territory or the enactment of special laws to fit thepeculiar condition thereof, the regulation if need be of the labor systemtherein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to theCongress.If the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honorrequires, the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abruptassimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highestfranchises of citizenship, and having due regard to the geographicalconditions, the most just provisions for self rule in local matters withthe largest political liberties as an integral part of our Nation will beaccorded to the Hawaiians. No less is due to a people who, after nearlyfive years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the obligations ofself governing statehood, come of their free will to merge their destiniesin our body politic.The questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by reason of thetreatment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the Islands under theHawaiian Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage ofsettlement by negotiation. This Government has not been invited to mediate,and on the other hand has sought no intervention in that matter, furtherthan to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and directadjustment by the two sovereign States in interest as shall comport withequity and honor. It is gratifying to learn that the apprehensions at firstdisplayed on the part of Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii\'s national lifethrough annexation might impair privileges to which Japan honorably laidclaim, have given place to confidence in the uprightness of thisGovernment, and in the sincerity of its purpose to deal with all possibleulterior questions in the broadest spirit of friendliness.As to the representation of this Government to Nicaragua, Salvador, andCosta Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, confirmed asminister of the United States to the States of Nicaragua, Salvador andCosta Rica, shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica, and there temporarilyestablish the headquarters of the United States to those three States. Itook this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of thiscountry. It was developed upon an investigation by the Secretary of Statethat the Government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to receive Mr. Merryin his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of the compactconcluded June 20, 1895, whereby that Republic and those of Salvador andHonduras, forming what is known as the Greater Republic of Central America,had surrendered to the representative Diet thereof their right to receiveand send diplomatic agents. The Diet was not willing to accept him becausehe was not accredited to that body. I could not accredit him to that bodybecause the appropriation law of Congress did not permit it. Mr. Baker, thepresent minister at Managua, has been directed to present his letters ofrecall.Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the Governments ofGuatemala and Honduras, the same as his predecessor. Guatemala is not amember of the Greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is. Shouldthis latter Government decline to receive him, he has been instructed toreport this fact to his Government and await its further instructions.A subject of large importance to our country, and increasing appreciationon the part of the people, is the completion of the great highway of tradebetween the Atlantic and Pacific, known as the Nicaragua Canal. Its utilityand value to American commerce is universally admitted. The Commissionappointed under date of July 24 last "to continue the surveys andexaminations authorized by the act approved March 2, 1895," in regard to"the proper route, feasibility, and cost of construction of the NicaraguaCanal, with a view of making complete plans for the entire work ofconstruction of such canal," is now employed in the undertaking. In thefuture I shall take occasion to transmit to Congress the report of thisCommission, making at the same time such further suggestions as may thenseem advisable.Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897, for thepromotion of an international agreement respecting bimetallism, I appointedon the 14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, Hon.Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine of Massachusetts,as special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligentin their efforts to secure the concurrence and cooperation of Europeancountries in the international settlement of the question, but up to thistime have not been able to secure an agreement contemplated by theirmission.The gratifying action of our great sister Republic of France in joiningthis country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the principalcommercial nations of Europe, whereby a fixed and relative value betweengold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that we are not aloneamong the larger nations of the world in realizing the internationalcharacter of the problem and in the desire of reaching some wise andpractical solution of it. The British Government has published a resume ofthe steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the specialenvoys of the United States, with whom our ambassador at London activelyco operated in the presentation of this subject to Her Majesty\'sGovernment. This will be laid before Congress.Our special envoys have not made their final report, as furthernegotiations between the representatives of this Government and theGovernments of other countries are pending and in contemplation. Theybelieve that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respectingthe position of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metalsand kindred questions may yet be solved by further negotiations.Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys havealready demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject,and it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in aninternational agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold andsilver as money upon such terms, and with such safeguards as will securethe use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice to anyclass of our citizens.In order to execute as early as possible the provisions of the third andfourth sections of the Revenue Act, approved July 24, 1897, I appointed theHon. John A. Kasson of Iowa, a special commissioner plenipotentiary toundertake the requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring toavail themselves of these provisions. The negotiations are now proceedingwith several Governments, both European and American. It is believed thatby a careful exercise of the powers conferred by that Act some grievancesof our own and of other countries in our mutual trade relations may beeither removed, or largely alleviated, and that the volume of ourcommercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to both contractingparties.Most desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism isthe effort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marineshould be improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of thecarrying trade of the world. We do not do it now. We should be the laggardno longer. The inferiority of our merchant marine is justly humiliating tothe national pride. The Government by every proper constitutional means,should aid in making our ships familiar visitors at every commercial portof the world, thus opening up new and valuable markets to the surplusproducts of the farm and the factory.The efforts which had been made during the two previous years by mypredecessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the NorthPacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were renewed at an early date by thisAdministration, and have been pursued with earnestness. Upon my invitation,the Governments of Japan and Russia sent delegates to Washington, and aninternational conference was held during the months of October and Novemberlast, wherein it was unanimously agreed that under the existing regulationsthis species of useful animals was threatened with extinction, and that aninternational agreement of all the interested powers was necessary fortheir adequate protection.The Government of Great Britain did not see proper to be represented atthis conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, as delegates, theexpert commissioners of Great Britain and Canada who had, during the pasttwo years, visited the Pribilof Islands, and who met in conference similarcommissioners on the part of the United States. The result of thisconference was an agreement on important facts connected with the conditionof the seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which should place beyondcontroversy the duty of the Governments concerned to adopt measures withoutdelay for the preservation and restoration of the herd. Negotiations tothis end are now in progress, the result of which I hope to be able toreport to Congress at an early day.International arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjectsclaiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen thegeneral views on this question expressed in my inaugural address. The bestsentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settlement ofdifferences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war.Treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without in anyway imperiling our interests or our honor, shall have my constantencouragement.The acceptance by this Government of the invitation of the Republic ofFrance to participate in the Universal Exposition of 1900, at Paris, wasimmediately followed by the appointment of a special commissioner torepresent the United States in the proposed exposition, with specialreference to the securing of space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of theUnited States.The special commissioner delayed his departure for Paris long enough toascertain the probable demand for space by American exhibitors. Hisinquiries developed an almost unprecedented interest in the proposedexposition, and the information thus acquired enabled him to justify anapplication for a much larger allotment of space for the American sectionthan had been reserved by the exposition authorities. The result wasparticularly gratifying, in view of the fact that the United States was oneof the last countries to accept the invitation of France.The reception accorded our special commissioner was most cordial, and hewas given every reasonable assurance that the United States would receive aconsideration commensurate with the proportions of our exhibit. The reportof the special commissioner as to the magnitude and importance of thecoming exposition, and the great demand for space by American exhibitors,supplies new arguments for a liberal and judicious appropriation byCongress, to the end that an exhibit fairly representative of theindustries and resources of our country may be made in an exposition whichwill illustrate the world\'s progress during the nineteenth century. Thatexposition is intended to be the most important and comprehensive of thelong series of international exhibitions, of which our own at Chicago was abrilliant example, and it is desirable that the United States should make aworthy exhibit of American genius and skill and their unrivaledachievements in every branch of industry.The present immediately effective force of the Navy consists of four battleships of the first class, two of the second, and forty eight other vessels,ranging from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are underconstruction five battle ships of the first class, sixteen torpedo boats,and one submarine boat. No provision has yet been made for the armor ofthree of the five battle ships, as it has been impossible to obtain it atthe price fixed by Congress. It is of great importance that Congressprovide this armor, as until then the ships are of no fighting value.The present naval force, especially in view of its increase by the shipsnow under construction, while not as large as that of a few other powers,is a formidable force; its vessels are the very best of each type; and withthe increase that should be made to it from time to time in the future, andcareful attention to keeping it in a high state of efficiency and repair,it is well adapted to the necessities of the country.The great increase of the Navy which has taken place in recent years wasjustified by the requirements for national defense, and has received publicapprobation. The time has now arrived, however, when this increase, towhich the country is committed, should, for a time, take the form ofincreased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels.It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on the Pacific Coastcapable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic Coast,and that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under repairand therefore incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to providethree or four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic Coast, at least one onthe Pacific Coast, and a floating dock in the Gulf. This is therecommendation of a very competent Board, appointed to investigate thesubject. There should also be ample provision made for powder andprojectiles, and other munitions of war, and for an increased number ofofficers and enlisted men. Some additions are also necessary to ournavy yards, for the repair and care of our large number of vessels. Asthere are now on the stocks five battle ships of the largest class, whichcannot be completed for a year or two, I concur with the recommendation ofthe Secretary of the Navy for an appropriation authorizing the constructionof one battle ship for the Pacific Coast, where, at present, there is onlyone in commission and one under construction, while on the Atlantic Coastthere are three in commission and four under construction; and also thatseveral torpedo boats be authorized in connection with our general systemof coast defense.The Territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention ofCongress. The conditions now existing demand material changes in the lawsrelating to the Territory. The great influx of population during the pastsummer and fall and the prospect of a still larger immigration in thespring will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of civilauthority within the Territory or postpone the establishment of a morethorough government.A general system of public surveys has not yet been extended to Alaska andall entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys. Theact of Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United Statescontained the reservation that it should not be construed to put in forcethe general land laws of the country. By act approved March 3, 1891,authority was given for entry of lands for town site purposes and also forthe purchase of not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres then orthereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The purpose ofCongress as thus far expressed has been that only such rights should applyto that Territory as should be specifically named.It will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote andyet promising portion of our country. Special authority was given to thePresident by the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1897, to divide thatTerritory into two land districts and to designate the boundaries thereofand to appoint registers and receivers of said land offices, and thePresident was also authorized to appoint a surveyor general for the entiredistrict. Pursuant to this authority, a surveyor general and receiver havebeen appointed, with offices at Sitka. If in the ensuing year theconditions justify it, the additional land district authorized by law willbe established, with an office at some point in the Yukon Valley. Noappropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that is nownecessary to be done for the two land districts into which the Territory isto be divided.I concur with the Secretary of War in his suggestions as to the necessityfor a military force in the Territory of Alaska for the protection ofpersons and property. Already a small force, consisting of twenty five men,with two officers, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Randall, of theEighth Infantry, has been sent to St. Michael to establish a militarypost.As it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development andsettlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizens there withthe benefits of legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon Congress theestablishment of a system of government with such flexibility as willenable it to adjust itself to the future areas of greatest population.The startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon Rivercountry, of the probable shortage of food for the large number of peoplewho are wintering there without the means of leaving the country areconfirmed in such measure as to justify bringing the matter to theattention of Congress. Access to that country in winter can be had only bythe passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps animpossible task. However, should these reports of the suffering of ourfellow citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should bemade to carry them relief.For a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions underwhich the Five Civilized Tribes were established in the Indian Territoryunder treaty provisions with the United States, with the right ofself government and the exclusion of all white persons from within theirborders, have undergone so complete a change as to render the continuanceof the system thus inaugurated practically impossible. The total number ofthe Five Civilized Tribes, as shown by the last census, is 45,494, and thisnumber has not materially increased; while the white population isestimated at from 200,000 to 250,000 which, by permission of the IndianGovernment has settled in the Territory. The present area of the IndianTerritory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very fertile land.The United States citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom havegone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities,have made permanent homes for themselves. Numerous towns have been built inwhich from 500 to 5,000 white people now reside. Valuable residences andbusiness houses have been erected in many of them. Large businessenterprises are carried on in which vast sums of money are employed, andyet these people, who have invested their capital in the development of theproductive resources of the country, are without title to the land theyoccupy, and have no voice whatever in the government either of the Nationsor Tribes. Thousands of their children who were born in the Territory areof school age, but the doors of the schools of the Nations are shut againstthem, and what education they get is by private contribution. No provisionfor the protection of the life or property of these white citizens is madeby the Tribal Governments and Courts.The Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have absorbedgreat tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and governmentby an Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to the detrimentof the people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keepits citizens out of the Territory, and the executory conditions containedin the treaties with these Nations have for the most part become impossibleof execution. Nor has it been possible for the Tribal Governments to secureto each individual Indian his full enjoyment in common with Other Indiansof the common property of the Nations. Friends of the Indians have longbelieved that the best interests of the Indians of the Five CivilizedTribes would be found in American citizenship, with all the rights andprivileges which belong to that condition.By section 16, of the act of March 3, 1893, the President was authorized toappoint three commissioners to enter into negotiations with the Cherokee,Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (or Creek), and Seminole Nations, commonlyknown as the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory. Briefly, thepurposes of the negotiations were to be: The extinguishment of Tribaltitles to any lands within that Territory now held by any and all suchNations or Tribes, either by cession of the same or some part thereof tothe United States, or by allotment and division of the same in severaltyamong the Indians of such Nations or Tribes respectively as may be entitledto the same, or by such other method as may be agreed upon between theseveral Nations and Tribes aforesaid, or each of them, with the UnitedStates, with a view to such an adjustment upon the basis of justice andequity as may, with the consent of the said Nations of Indians so far asmay be necessary, be requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creationof a State or States of the Union which shall embrace the lands within saidIndian Territory.The Commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians werevery slow to act, and those in control manifested a decided disinclinationto meet with favor the propositions submitted to them. A little more thanthree years after this organization the Commission effected an agreementwith the Choctaw Nation alone. The Chickasaws, however, refused to agree toits terms, and as they have a common interest with the Choctaws in thelands of said Nations, the agreement with the latter Nation could have noeffect without the consent of the former. On April 23, 1897, the Commissioneffected an agreement with both tribes the Choctaws and Chickasaws. Thisagreement, it is understood, has been ratified by the constitutedauthorities of the respective Tribes or Nations parties thereto, and onlyrequires ratification by Congress to make it binding.On the 27th of September, 1897, an agreement was effected with the CreekNation, but it is understood that the National Council of said Nation hasrefused to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with theCherokees, the most populous of the Five Civilized Tribes, and with theSeminoles, the smallest in point of numbers and territory.The provision in the Indian Appropriation Act, approved June 10, 1896,makes it the duty of the Commission to investigate and determine the rightsof applicants for citizenship in the Five Civilized Tribes, and to makecomplete census rolls of the citizens of said Tribes. The Commission is atpresent engaged in this work among the Creeks, and has made appointmentsfor taking the census of these people up to and including the 30th of thepresent month.Should the agreement between the Choctaws and Chickasaws be ratified byCongress and should the other Tribes fail to make an agreement with theCommission, then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be had byCongress, which, while just and honorable to the Indians, shall beequitable to the white people who have settled upon these lands byinvitation of the Tribal Nations.Hon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to theSecretary of the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says:"Individual ownership is, in their (the Commission\'s) opinion, absolutelyessential to any permanent improvement in present conditions, and the lackof it is the root of nearly all the evils which so grievously afflict thesepeople. Allotment by agreement is the only possible method, unless theUnited States Courts are clothed with the authority to apportion the landsamong the citizen Indians for whose use it was originally granted."I concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure forthe evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts, excepting bytheir resumption by the Government which created them.The recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and townsthroughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce, anddemonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws aswill make the regulations of the national quarantine authorities paramount.The Secretary of the Treasury, in the portion of his report relating to theoperation of the Marine Hospital Service, calls attention to the defects inthe present quarantine laws, and recommends amendments thereto which willgive the Treasury Department the requisite authority to prevent theinvasion of epidemic diseases from foreign countries, and in times ofemergency, like that of the past summer, will add to the efficiency of thesanitary measures for the protection of the people, and at the same timeprevent unnecessary restriction of commerce. I concur in hisrecommendation.In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellowfever, the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease,which up to the present time has been undetermined, is obvious, and to thisend a systematic bacteriological investigation should be made. I thereforerecommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission by thePresident, to consist of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selectedfrom the medical officers of the Marine Hospital Service, one to beappointed from civil life, one to be detailed from the medical officers ofthe Army, and one from the medical officers of the Navy.The Union Pacific Railway, Main Line, was sold under the decree of theUnited States Court for the District of Nebraska, on the 1st and 2d ofNovember of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of theprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interestthereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness, $58,448,223.75. Thebid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgageclaim of the Government, principal and interest.The sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific Line, upon whichthe Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at theinstance of the Government to December 16, 1897. The debt of this divisionof the Union Pacific Railway to the Government on November 1, 1897, was theprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $6,303,000, and the unpaid and accruedinterest thereon, $6,626,690.33, making a total of $12,929,690.33.The sale of this road was originally advertised for November 4, but for thepurpose of securing the utmost public notice of the event it was postponeduntil December 16, and a second advertisement of the sale was made. By thedecree of the Court, the upset price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific willyield to the Government the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs,and charges. If no other or better bid is made, this sum is all that theGovernment will receive on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. The Governmenthas no information as to whether there will be other bidders or a betterbid than the minimum amount herein stated. The question presented thereforeis: Whether the Government shall, under the authority given it by the actof March 3, 1887, purchase or redeem the road in the event that a bid isnot made by private parties covering the entire Government claim. Toqualify the Government to bid at the sales will require a deposit of$900,000, as follows: In the Government cause $500,000 and in each of thefirst mortgage causes $200,000, and in the latter the deposit must be incash. Payments at the sale are as follows: Upon the acceptance of the bid asum which with the amount already deposited shall equal fifteen per cent ofthe bid; the balance in installments of twenty five per cent thirty, forty,and fifty days after the confirmation of the sale. The lien on the KansasPacific prior to that of the Government on the 30th July, 1897, principaland interest, amounted to $7,281,048.11. The Government, therefore, shouldit become the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the firstmortgage lien.I believe that under the act of 1887 it has the authority to do this and inabsence of any action by Congress I shall direct the Secretary of theTreasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the Court\'s decree toqualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equalthe principal of the debt due to the Government; but suggest in order toremove all controversy that an amendment of the law be immediately passedexplicitly giving such powers and appropriating in general terms whateversum is sufficient therefor.In so important a matter as the Government becoming the possible owner ofrailroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feelconstrained to lay before Congress these facts for its consideration andaction before the consummation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that theGovernment should not permit the property to be sold at a price which willyield less than one half of the principal of its debt and less thanone fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. But whether theGovernment, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidderand thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the Congress foraction.The Library building provided for by the act of Congress approved April 15,1886, has been completed and opened to the public. It should be a matter ofcongratulation that through the foresight and munificence of Congress thenation possesses this noble treasure house of knowledge. It is earnestly tobe hoped that having done so much toward the cause of education, Congresswill continue to develop the Library in every phase of research to the endthat it may be not only one of the most magnificent but among the richestand most useful libraries in the world.The important branch of our Government known as the Civil Service, thepractical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnestdiscussion, has of late years received increased legislative and Executiveapproval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon astill firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the rightof our veteran soldiers to reinstatement in deserving cases has beenasserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefullyguarded against, the examinations for admittance to the service enlargedand at the same time rendered less technical and more practical; and adistinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal uponall cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal ofofficials in any of the Departments. This order has been made to give tothe accused his right to be heard but without in anyway impairing the powerof removal, which should always be exercised in cases of inefficiency andincompetency, and which is one of the vital safeguards of the civil servicereform system, preventing stagnation and deadwood and keeping everyemployee keenly alive to the fact that the security of his tenure dependsnot on favor but on his own tested and carefully watched record ofservice.Much of course still remains to be accomplished before the system can bemade reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in theclassified service which ought to be exempted and others not classified mayproperly be included. I shall not hesitate to exempt cases which I thinkhave been improperly included in the classified service or include thosewhich in my judgment will best promote the public service. The system hasthe approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to uphold and extendit.I am forced by the length of this Message to omit many important referencesto affairs of the Government with which Congress will have to deal at thepresent session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, toall of which I invite your earnest attention.The estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several Departmentswill, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the Congress may notfind it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it shouldnot encourage their increase. These expenses will in my judgment admit of adecrease in many branches of the Government without injury to the publicservice. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within thereceipts of the Government, and thus avoid a deficit.
William McKinley
To the Senate and House of Representatives:Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our peoplerejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree ofprosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded.Manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yieldedabundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded,revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased theTreasury\'s receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances ofthe Government have been successfully administered and its credit advancedto the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world\'shighest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteouscause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement moreclosely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of thecountry.A review of the relation of the United States to other powers, alwaysappropriate, is this year of primary importance in view of the momentousissues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimatedetermination by arms and involving far reaching consequences which willrequire the earnest attention of the Congress.In my last annual message very full consideration was given to the questionof the duty of the Government of the United States toward Spain and theCuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which wewere then called upon to deal. The considerations then advanced and theexposition of the views therein expressed disclosed my sense of the extremegravity of the situation. Setting aside as logically unfounded orpractically inadmissible the recognition of the Cuban insurgents asbelligerents, the recognition of the independence of Cuba, neutralintervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between thecontestants, intervention in favor of one or the other party, and forcibleannexation of the island, I concluded it was honestly due to our friendlyrelations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance torealize her expectations of reform to which she had become irrevocablycommitted. Within a few weeks previously she had announced comprehensiveplans which it was confidently asserted would be efficacious to remedy theevils so deeply affecting our own country, so injurious to the trueinterests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba, and sorepugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity.The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward thepacification of Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the capitaland some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor of theinhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large extent ofterritory held by the insurgents, while the military arm, obviously unableto cope with the still active rebellion, continued many of the mostobjectionable and offensive policies of the government that had precededit. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappyreconcentrados, despite the reiterated professions made in that regard andthe amount appropriated by Spain to that end. The proffered expedient ofzones of cultivation proved illusory. Indeed no less practical nor moredelusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the exhaustedand destitute people, stripped of all that made life and home dear andherded in a strange region among unsympathetic strangers hardly lessnecessitous than themselves.By the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully increased.Conservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths among thesedistressed people at over 40 per cent from the time General Weyler\'s decreeof reconcentration was enforced. With the acquiescence of the Spanishauthorities, a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contributionsraised in this country and distributed, under the direction of theconsul general and the several consuls, by noble and earnest individualeffort through the organized agencies of the American Red Cross. Thousandsof lives were thus saved, but many thousands more were inaccessible to suchforms of aid.The war continued on the old footing, without comprehensive plan,developing only the same spasmodic encounters, barren of strategic result,that had marked the course of the earlier ten years\' rebellion as well asthe present insurrection from its start. No alternative save physicalexhaustion of either combatant, and therewithal the practical ruin of theisland, lay in sight, but how far distant no one could venture toconjecture.At this juncture, on the 15th of February last, occurred the destruction ofthe battle ship Maine while rightfully lying in the harbor of Havana on amission of international courtesy and good will a catastrophe thesuspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nation\'s heartprofoundly. It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sensedistinguishing our national character that this shocking blow, falling upona generous people already deeply touched by preceding events in Cuba, didnot move them to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no longer theexistence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that madepossible such a deed, by whomsoever wrought. Yet the instinct of justiceprevailed, and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searchinginvestigation at once set on foot. The finding of the naval board ofinquiry established that the origin of the explosion was external, by asubmarine mine, and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fixthe responsibility of its authorship.All these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before thefinding of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with Spain andtoward Cuba was at hand. So strong was this belief that it needed but abrief Executive suggestion to the Congress to receive immediate answer tothe duty of making instant provision for the possible and perhaps speedilyprobable emergency of war, and the remarkable, almost unique, spectacle waspresented of a unanimous vote of both Houses, on the 9th of March,appropriating $50,000,000 "for the national defense and for each and everypurpose connected therewith, to be expended at the discretion of thePresident." That this act of prevision came none too soon was disclosedwhen the application of the fund was undertaken. Our coasts werepractically undefended. Our Navy needed large provision for increasedammunition and supplies, and even numbers to cope with any sudden attackfrom the navy of Spain, which comprised modern vessels of the highest typeof continental perfection. Our Army also required enlargement of men andmunitions. The details of the hurried preparation for the dreadedcontingency are told in the reports of the Secretaries of War and of theNavy, and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that theoutbreak of war when it did come found our nation not unprepared to meetthe conflict.Nor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country. Itwas felt by the continental powers, which on April 6, through theirambassadors and envoys, addressed to the Executive an expression of hopethat humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government andpeople, and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which,while securing the maintenance of peace, would afford all necessaryguaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba. In responding to thatrepresentation I said I shared the hope the envoys had expressed that peacemight be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition ofdisturbance in Cuba, so injurious and menacing to our interests andtranquillity, as well as shocking to our sentiments of humanity; and whileappreciating the humanitarian and disinterested character of thecommunication they had made on behalf of the powers, I stated theconfidence of this Government, for its part, that equal appreciation wouldbe shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfill a duty tohumanity by ending a situation the indefinite prolongation of which hadbecome insufferable.Still animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictatesof duty, no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the Cubanstruggle. Negotiations to this object continued actively with theGovernment of Spain, looking to the immediate conclusion of a six months\'armistice in Cuba, with a view to effect the recognition of her people\'sright to independence. Besides this, the instant revocation of the order ofreconcentration was asked, so that the sufferers, returning to their homesand aided by united American and Spanish effort, might be put in a way tosupport themselves and, by orderly resumption of the well nigh destroyedproductive energies of the island, contribute to the restoration of itstranquillity and well being. Negotiations continued for some little time atMadrid, resulting in offers by the Spanish Government which could not butbe regarded as inadequate. It was proposed to confide the preparation ofpeace to the insular parliament, yet to be convened under the autonomousdecrees of November, 1897, but without impairment in any wise of theconstitutional powers of the Madrid Government, which to that end wouldgrant an armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for such time as thegeneral in chief might see fit to fix. How and with what scope ofdiscretionary powers the insular parliament was expected to set about the"preparation" of peace did not appear. If it were to be by negotiation withthe insurgents, the issue seemed to rest on the one side with a body chosenby a fraction of the electors in the districts under Spanish control, andon the other with the insurgent population holding the interior country,unrepresented in the so called parliament and defiant at the suggestion ofsuing for peace.Grieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors toreach a practicable solution, I felt it my duty to remit the whole questionto the Congress. In the message of April 11, 1898, I announced that withthis last overture in the direction of immediate peace in Cuba and itsdisappointing reception by Spain the effort of the Executive was brought toan end. I again reviewed the alternative courses of action which had beenproposed, concluding that the only one consonant with international policyand compatible with our firm set historical traditions was intervention asa neutral to stop the war and check the hopeless sacrifice of life, eventhough that resort involved "hostile constraint upon both the parties tothe contest, as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventualsettlement." The grounds justifying that step were the interests ofhumanity, the duty to protect the life and property of our citizens inCuba, the right to check injury to our commerce and people through thedevastation of the island, and, most important, the need of removing atonce and forever the constant menace and the burdens entailed upon ourGovernment by the uncertainties and perils of the situation caused by theunendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said: The long trial has proved that theobject for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained. The fire ofinsurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons, but it has notbeen and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods.The only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer beendured is the enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, inthe name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests whichgive us the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba muststop. In view of all this the Congress was asked to authorize and empowerthe President to take measures to secure a full and final termination ofhostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba and to secure in theisland the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintainingorder and observing its international obligations, insuring peace andtranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and forthe accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval forces ofthe United States as might be necessary, with added authority to continuegenerous relief to the starving people of Cuba.The response of the Congress, after nine days of earnest deliberation,during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed onevery point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action witha formal recognition of the Republic of Cuba as the true and lawfulgovernment of that island a proposition which failed of adoption theCongress, after conference, on the 19th of April, by a vote of 42 to 35 inthe Senate and 311 to 6 in the House of Representatives, passed thememorable joint resolution declaring First. That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be,free and independent.Second. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and theGovernment of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government ofSpain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cubaand withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.Third. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of theUnited States and to call into the actual service of the United States themilitia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to carrythese resolutions into effect.Fourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition orintention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over saidisland except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its determinationwhen that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the islandto its people. This resolution was approved by the Executive on the nextday, April 20. A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister atthis capital, who forthwith announced that his continuance in Washingtonhad thereby become impossible, and asked for his passports, which weregiven him. He thereupon withdrew from Washington, leaving the protection ofSpanish interests in the United States to the French ambassador and theAustro Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with its communication to theSpanish minister here, General Woodford, the American minister at Madrid,was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution anddirected to communicate it to the Government of Spain with the formaldemand that it at once relinquish its authority and government in theisland of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom, coupling this demand withannouncement of the intentions of this Government as to the future of theisland, in conformity with the fourth clause of the resolution, and givingSpain until noon of April 23 to reply.That demand, although, as above shown, officially made known to the Spanishenvoy here, was not delivered at Madrid. After the instruction reachedGeneral Woodford on the morning of April 21, but before he could presentit, the Spanish minister of state notified him that upon the President\'sapproval of the joint resolution the Madrid Government, regarding the actas "equivalent to an evident declaration of war," had ordered its ministerin Washington to withdraw, thereby breaking off diplomatic relationsbetween the two countries and ceasing all official communication betweentheir respective representatives. General Woodford thereupon demanded hispassports and quitted Madrid the same day.Spain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated thatcomplete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war, theexecutive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by me tomeet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign states. OnApril 22 I proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of Cuba, includingports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port ofCienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba, and on the 23d I called forvolunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution. By my message of April25 the Congress was informed of the situation, and I recommended formaldeclaration of the existence of a state of war between the United Statesand Spain. The Congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approvedApril 25, 1898, declaring the existence of such war from and including the21st day of April, and reenacted the provision of the resolution of April20 directing the President to use all the armed forces of the nation tocarry that act into effect. Due notification of the existence of war asaforesaid was given April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with whichthe United States maintain relations, in order that their neutrality mightbe assured during the war. The various governments responded withproclamations of neutrality, each after its own methods. It is not amongthe least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations ofneutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate anddifficult circumstances.In further fulfillment of international duty I issued, April 26, 1893, aproclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vesselsand their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the right ofsearch, and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under enemy\'sflag. A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish Government. In theconduct of hostilities the rules of the Declaration of Paris, includingabstention from resort to privateering, have accordingly been observed byboth belligerents, although neither was a party to that declaration.Our country thus, after an interval of half a century of peace with allnations, found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy.Every nerve was strained to meet the emergency. The response to the initialcall for 125,000 volunteers was instant and complete, as was also theresult of the second call, of May 25, for 75,000 additional volunteers. Theranks of the Regular Army were increased to the limits provided by the actof April 26, 1898.The enlisted force of the Navy on the 15th day of August, when it reachedits maximum, numbered 24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred and threevessels were added to the Navy by purchase, 1 was presented to theGovernment, 1 leased, and the 4 vessels of the International NavigationCompany the St. Paul, St. Louis, New York, and Paris were chartered. Inaddition to these the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders were turnedover to the Navy Department and became temporarily a part of the auxiliaryNavy.The maximum effective fighting force of the Navy during the war, separatedinto classes, was as follows:Four battle ships of the first class, 1 battle ship of the second class, 2armored cruisers, 6 coast defense monitors, 1 armored ram, 12 protectedcruisers, 3 unprotected cruisers, 18 gunboats, 1 dynamite cruiser, 11torpedo boats; vessels of the old Navy, including monitors, 14. AuxiliaryNavy: 11 auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted yachts, 27 converted tugs, 19converted colliers, 15 revenue cutters, 4 light house tenders, and 19miscellaneous vessels.Much alarm was felt along our entire Atlantic seaboard lest some attackmight be made by the enemy. Every precaution was taken to prevent possibleinjury to our great cities lying along the coast. Temporary garrisons wereprovided, drawn from the State militia; infantry and light batteries weredrawn from the volunteer force. About 12,000 troops were thus employed. Thecoast signal service was established for observing the approach of anenemy\'s ships to the coast of the United States, and the Life Saving andLight House services cooperated, which enabled the Navy Department to haveall portions of the Atlantic coast, from Maine to Texas, underobservation.The auxiliary Navy was created under the authority of Congress and wasofficered and manned by the Naval Militia of the several States. Thisorganization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line ofdefense. Under the direction of the Chief of Engineers submarine mines wereplaced at the most exposed points. Before the outbreak of the war permanentmining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at nearly allimportant harbors. Most of the torpedo material was not to be found in themarket, and had to be specially manufactured. Under date of April 19district officers were directed to take all preliminary measures short ofthe actual attaching of the loaded mines to the cables, and on April 22telegraphic orders were issued to place the loaded mines in position.The aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harborsfrom Maine to California. Preparations were also made for the planting ofmines at certain other harbors, but owing to the early destruction of theSpanish fleet these mines were not placed.The Signal Corps was promptly organized, and performed service of the mostdifficult and important character. Its operations during the war coveredthe electrical connection of all coast fortifications, the establishment oftelephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at Manila, Santiago,and in Puerto Rico. There were constructed 300 miles of line at ten greatcamps, thus facilitating military movements from those points in a mannerheretofore unknown in military administration. Field telegraph lines wereestablished and maintained under the enemy\'s fire at Manila, and later theManila Hongkong cable was reopened.In Puerto Rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued route,and on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept intelegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders onfour different lines of operations.There was placed in Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship, withwar cables and cable gear, suitable both for the destruction ofcommunications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own. Twoocean cables were destroyed under the enemy\'s batteries at Santiago. Theday previous to the landing of General Shafter\'s corps, at Caimanera,within 20 miles of the landing place, cable communications were establishedand a cable station opened giving direct communication with the Governmentat Washington. This service was invaluable to the Executive in directingthe operations of the Army and Navy. With a total force of over 1,300, theloss was by disease in camp and field, officers and men included, only 5.The national defense fund of $50,000,000 was expended in large part by theArmy and Navy, and the objects for which it was used are fully shown in thereports of the several Secretaries. It was a most timely appropriation,enabling the Government to strengthen its defenses and make preparationsgreatly needed in case of war.This fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for theconduct of the war, the patriotism of the Congress provided the means inthe war revenue act of June 13 by authorizing a 3 per cent popular loan notto exceed $400,000,000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes. Of theauthorized loan $200,000,000 were offered and promptly taken thesubscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over,while, preference being given to the smaller bids, no single allotmentexceeded $5,000. This was a most encouraging and significant result,showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of thepeople to uphold their country\'s honor.It is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of theextraordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21, but abrief recital of its more salient features is appropriate.The first encounter of the war in point of date took place April 27, when adetachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in force atMatanzas, shelled the harbor forts, and demolished several new works inconstruction.The next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritimewarfare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore George Dewey, had lain for someweeks at Hongkong. Upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality beingissued and the customary twenty four hours\' notice being given, it repairedto Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, whence it proceeded to the Philippine Islandsunder telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the formidable Spanish fleetthen assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the 1st of May the American forceentered Manila Bay, and after a few hours\' engagement effected the totaldestruction of the Spanish fleet, consisting of ten war ships and atransport, besides capturing the naval station and forts at Cavite, thusannihilating the Spanish naval power in the Pacific Ocean and completelycontrolling the bay of Manila, with the ability to take the city at will.Not a life was lost on our ships, the wounded only numbering seven, whilenot a vessel was materially injured. For this gallant achievement theCongress, upon my recommendation, fitly bestowed upon the actors prefermentand substantial reward.The effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people andupon the fortunes of the war was instant. A prestige of invincibilitythereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle.Reenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Major GeneralMerritt and firmly established within sight of the capital, which layhelpless before our guns.On the 7th day of May the Government was advised officially of the victoryat Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet what troopswould be required. The information was received on the 15th day of May, andthe first army expedition sailed May 25 and arrived off Manila June 30.Other expeditions soon followed, the total force consisting of 641 officersand 15,058 enlisted men.Only reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented theearly storming and capture of the city, and therewith the absolute militaryoccupancy of the whole group. The insurgents meanwhile had resumed theactive hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of December, 1897.Their forces invested Manila from the northern and eastern sides, but wereconstrained by Admiral Dewey and General Merrill from attempting anassault. It was fitting that whatever was to be done in the way of decisiveoperations in that quarter should be accomplished by the strong arm of theUnited States alone. Obeying the stern precept of war which enjoins theovercoming of the adversary and the extinction of his power whereverassailable as the speedy and sure means to win a peace, divided victory wasnot permissible, for no partition of the rights and responsibilitiesattending the enforcement of a just and advantageous peace could be thoughtof.Following the comprehensive scheme of general attack, powerful forces wereassembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Puerto Rico.Meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed points. On May11 the cruiser Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow were unsuccessful in anattempt to silence the batteries at Cardenas, a gallant ensign, WorthBagley, and four seamen falling. These grievous fatalities were, strangelyenough, among the very few which occurred during our naval operations inthis extraordinary conflict.Meanwhile the Spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great vigor.A powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera, which had assembled at the CapeVerde Islands before the outbreak of hostilities, had crossed the ocean,and by its erratic movements in the Caribbean Sea delayed our militaryplans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were feltlest the Oregon and Marietta, then nearing home after their long voyagefrom San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might be surprised by AdmiralCervera\'s fleet, but their fortunate arrival dispelled these apprehensionsand lent much needed reenforcement. Not until Admiral Cervera took refugein the harbor of Santiago de Cuba, about May 19, was it practicable to plana systematic naval and military attack upon the Antillean possessions ofSpain.Several demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico inpreparation for the larger event. On May 13 the North Atlantic Squadronshelled San Juan de Puerto Rico. On May 30 Commodore Schley\'s squadronbombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor. Neither attackhad any material result. It was evident that well ordered land operationswere indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage.The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen butthe world by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 LieutenantHobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow outlet fromSantiago Harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel, under afierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with their lives as by amiracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a mostgratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band ofheroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish admiral, who sent a flag oftruce to notify Admiral Sampson of their safety and to compliment them ontheir daring act. They were subsequently exchanged July 7.By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island.Thereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On June 10, under aheavy protecting fire, a landing of 600 marines from the Oregon,Marblehead, and Yankee was effected in Guantanamo Bay, where it had beendetermined to establish a naval station.This important and essential port was taken from the enemy, after severefighting, by the marines, who were the first organized force of the UnitedStates to land in Cuba.The position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge ourforces. By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly in trenched.On June 22 the advance of the invading army under Major General Shafterlanded at Daiquiri, about 15 miles east of Santiago. This was accomplishedunder great difficulties, but with marvelous dispatch. On June 23 themovement against Santiago was begun. On the 24th the first seriousengagement took place, in which the First and Tenth Cavalry and the FirstUnited States Volunteer Cavalry, General Young\'s brigade of GeneralWheeler\'s division, participated, losing heavily. By nightfall, however,ground within 5 miles of Santiago was won. The advantage was steadilyincreased. On July 1 a severe battle took place, our forces gaining theoutworks of Santiago; on the 2d El Caney and San Juan were taken after adesperate charge, and the investment of the city was completed. The Navycooperated by shelling the town and the coast forts.On the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces, the 3dof July, occurred the decisive naval combat of the war. The Spanish fleet,attempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron undercommand of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the Spanishships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk and the MariaTeresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya, and Cristobal Colon driven ashore. TheSpanish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken prisoners. While the enemy\'sloss of life was deplorably large, some 600 perishing, on our side but oneman was killed, on the Brooklyn, and one man seriously wounded. Althoughour ships were repeatedly struck, not one was seriously injured. Where allso conspicuously distinguished themselves, from the commanders to thegunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms, each and allcontributing toward the achievement of this astounding victory, for whichneither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completenessof the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties, it would beinvidious to single out any for especial honor. Deserved promotion hasrewarded the more conspicuous actors. The nation\'s profoundest gratitude isdue to all of these brave men who by their skill and devotion in a fewshort hours crushed the sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph whosedecisiveness and far reaching consequences can scarcely be measured. Norcan we be unmindful of the achievements of our builders, mechanics, andartisans for their skill in the construction of our war ships.With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain\'s effort upon the ocean virtuallyceased. A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her Mediterraneanfleet, under Admiral Camara, to relieve Manila was abandoned, theexpedition being recalled after it had passed through the Suez Canal.The capitulation of Santiago followed. The city was closely besieged byland, while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief onthat side. After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatantsprotracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15, when, undermenace of immediate assault, the preliminaries of surrender were agreedupon. On the 17th General Shafter occupied the city. The capitulationembraced the entire eastern end of Cuba. The number of Spanish soldierssurrendering was 22,000, all of whom were subsequently conveyed to Spain atthe charge of the United States. The story of this successful campaign istold in the report of the Secretary of War, which will be laid before you.The individual valor of officers and soldiers was never more strikinglyshown than in the several engagements leading to the surrender of Santiago,while the prompt movements and successive victories won instant anduniversal applause. To those who gained this complete triumph, whichestablished the ascendency of the United States upon land as the fight offSantiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and lastinggratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. Nor should we alone rememberthe gallantry of the living; the dead claim our tears, and our losses bybattle and disease must cloud any exultation at the result and teach us toweigh the awful cost of war, however rightful the cause or signal thevictory.With the fall of Santiago the occupation of Puerto Rico became the nextstrategic necessity. General Miles had previously been assigned to organizean expedition for that purpose. Fortunately he was already at Santiago,where he had arrived on the 11th of July with reenforcements for GeneralShafter\'s army.With these troops, consisting of 3,415 infantry and artillery, twocompanies of engineers, and one company of the Signal Corps, General Milesleft Guantanamo on July 21, having nine transports convoyed by the fleetunder Captain Higginson with the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie,Gloucester, Columbia, and Yale, the two latter carrying troops. Theexpedition landed at Guanica July 25, which port was entered with littleopposition. Here the fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the Wasp, whilethe Puritan and Amphitrite went to San Juan and joined the New Orleans,which was engaged in blockading that port. The Major General Commanding wassubsequently reenforced by General Schwan\'s brigade of the Third ArmyCorps, by General Wilson with a part of his division, and also by GeneralBrooke with a part of his corps, numbering in all 16,973 officers and men.On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the island,from which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of theisland.With the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama, Hormigueros,Coamo, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan, therewas no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted with great vigor,and by the 12th of August much of the island was in our possession and theacquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time. At most ofthe points in the island our troops were enthusiastically welcomed.Protestations of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for delivery fromSpanish rule met our commanders at every stage. As a potent influencetoward peace the outcome of the Puerto Rican expedition was of greatconsequence, and generous commendation is due to those who participated init.The last scene of the war was enacted at Manila, its starting place. OnAugust 15, after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, inwhich the squadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally. Thecasualties were comparatively few. By this the conquest of the PhilippineIslands, virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistancewas destroyed by Admiral Dewey\'s victory of the 1st of May, was formallysealed. To General Merrill, his officers and men, for their uncomplainingand devoted service and for their gallantry in action, the nation issincerely grateful. Their long voyage was made with singular success, andthe soldierly conduct of the men, most of whom were without previousexperience in the military service, deserves unmeasured praise.The total casualties in killed and wounded in the Army during the war withSpain were: Officers killed, 23; enlisted men killed, 257; total, 280;officers wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1,464; total, 1,577. Of theNavy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as result of wounds, 1; invalided fromservice, 6; total, 91.It will be observed that while our Navy was engaged in two great battlesand in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment, and morethan 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and wereengaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in unfamiliarterritory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed andwounded; and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gunor a flag or a transport or a ship, and, with the exception of the crew ofthe Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.On August 7, forty six days from the date of the landing of GeneralShafter\'s army in Cuba and twenty one days from the surrender of Santiago,the United States troops commenced embarkation for home, and our entireforce was returned to the United States as early as August 24. They wereabsent from the United States only two months.It is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and devotionof that large portion of our Army which, although eager to be ordered tothe post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required outside of theUnited States. They did their whole duty, and, like their comrades at thefront, have earned the gratitude of the nation. In like manner, theofficers and men of the Army and of the Navy who remained in theirdepartments and stations faithfully performing most important dutiesconnected with the war, and whose requests for assignment in the field andat sea I was compelled to refuse because their services were indispensablehere, are entitled to the highest commendation. It is my regret that thereseems to be no provision for their suitable recognition.In this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordialappreciation the timely and useful work of the American National Red Cross,both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in sanitaryassistance at several of the camps of assemblage, and later, under the ableand experienced leadership of the president of the society, Miss ClaraBarton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in Cuba.Working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under theirsanction and approval, and with the enthusiastic cooperation of manypatriotic women and societies in the various States, the Red Cross hasfully maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness andability to exercise the noble purposes of its international organization,thus justifying the confidence and support which it has received at thehands of the American people. To the members and officers of this societyand all who aided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lastinggratitude of the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded.In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations tothe Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance, forwhich the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble prayer forthe continuance of His favor.The annihilation of Admiral Cervera\'s fleet, followed by the capitulationof Santiago, having brought to the Spanish Government a realizing sense ofthe hopelessness of continuing a struggle now become wholly unequal, itmade overtures of peace through the French ambassador, who, with the assentof his Government, had acted as the friendly representative of Spanishinterests during the war. On the 26th of July M. Cambon presented acommunication signed by the Duke of Almodovar, the Spanish minister ofstate, inviting the United States to state the terms upon which it would bewilling to make peace. On the 30th of July, by a communication addressed tothe Duke of Almodovar and handed to M. Cambon, the terms of this Governmentwere announced substantially as in the protocol afterwards signed. On the10th of August the Spanish reply, dated August 7, was handed by M. Cambonto the Secretary of State. It accepted unconditionally the terms imposed asto Cuba, Puerto Rico, and an island of the Ladrones group, but appeared toseek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as tothe Philippine Islands. Conceiving that discussion on this point couldneither be practical nor profitable, I directed that in order to avoidmisunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by proposing theembodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which the negotiationsfor peace were to be undertaken. The vague and inexplicit suggestions ofthe Spanish note could not be accepted, the only reply being to present asa virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol embodying the precise termstendered to Spain in our note of July 30, with added stipulations of detailas to the appointment of commissioners to arrange for the evacuation of theSpanish Antilles. On August 12 M. Cambon announced his receipt of fullpowers to sign the protocol so submitted. Accordingly, on the afternoon ofAugust 12, M. Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the Secretary ofState, as the plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a protocolproviding ARTICLE I. Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and titleto Cuba.ART. II. Spain will cede to the United States the island of Puerto Rico andother islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and also anisland in the Ladrones to be selected by the United States.ART. III. The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and harborof Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall determinethe control, disposition, and government of the Philippines. The fourtharticle provided for the appointment of joint commissions on the part ofthe United States and Spain, to meet in Havana and San Juan, respectively,for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details of the stipulatedevacuation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish islands in the WestIndies.The fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than fivecommissioners on each side, to meet at Paris not later than October 1 andto proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace, subjectto ratification according to the respective constitutional forms of the twocountries.The sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the protocolhostilities between the two countries should be suspended and that noticeto that effect should be given as soon as possible by each Government tothe commanders of its military and naval forces.Immediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation, ofAugust 12, suspending hostilities on the part of the United States. Thenecessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph. The blockadeof the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Puerto Rico was in like manner raised.On the 18th of August the muster out of 100,000 volunteers, or as near thatnumber as was found to be practicable, was ordered.On the 1st of December 101,165 officers and men had been mustered out anddischarged from the service, and 9,002 more will be mustered out by the10th of this month; also a corresponding number of general and generalstaff officers have been honorably discharged the service.The military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba, PuertoRico, and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed for Cuba,Major General James F. Wade, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, Major GeneralMatthew C. Butler; for Puerto Rico, Major General John R. Brooke,Rear Admiral Winfield S. Schley, Brigadier General William W. Gordon whosoon afterwards met the Spanish commissioners at Havana and San Juan,respectively. The Puerto Rican Joint Commission speedily accomplished itstask, and by the 18th of October the evacuation of the island wascompleted. The United States flag was raised over the island at noon onthat day. The administration of its affairs has been provisionallyintrusted to a military governor until the Congress shall otherwiseprovide. The Cuban Joint Commission has not yet terminated its labors.Owing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large numbers ofSpanish troops still in Cuba, the evacuation can not be completed beforethe 1st of January next.Pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol, I appointed William R. Day,lately Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye, and GeorgeGray, Senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to be the peacecommissioners on the part of the United States. Proceeding in due season toParis, they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners similarlyappointed on the part of Spain. Their negotiations have made hopefulprogress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definitive treaty ofpeace before the Senate, with a review of the steps leading to itssignature.I do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the newpossessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain. Suchdiscussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified.In the meantime and until the Congress has legislated otherwise it will bemy duty to continue the military governments which have existed since ouroccupation and give to the people security in life and property andencouragement under a just and beneficent rule.As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island itwill be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form agovernment for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest momentconsistent with safety and assured success. It is important that ourrelations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and ourcommercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assistin every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encouragethe industry of the people, and assist them to form a government whichshall be free and independent, thus realizing the best aspirations of theCuban people.Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane government,created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all internationalobligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry, and prosperity andpromote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may havebeen their relations in the past. Neither revenge nor passion should have aplace in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in theisland and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will becontinued.With the one exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of theUnited States with the great family of nations has been marked withcordiality, and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issuesthat necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign statesadjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solutionby amicable agreement.A long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the ArgentineRepublic and Chile, stretching along the Andean crests from the southernborder of the Atacama Desert to Magellan Straits, nearly a third of thelength of the South American continent, assumed an acute stage in the earlypart of the year, and afforded to this Government occasion to express thehope that the resort to arbitration, already contemplated by existingconventions between the parties, might prevail despite the gravedifficulties arising in its application. I am happy to say thatarrangements to this end have been perfected, the questions of fact uponwhich the respective commissioners were unable to agree being in course ofreference to Her Britannic Majesty for determination. A residual differencetouching the northern boundary line across the Atacama Desert, for whichexisting treaties provided no adequate adjustment, bids fair to be settledin like manner by a joint commission, upon which the United States ministerat Buenos Ayres has been invited to serve as umpire in the last resort.I have found occasion to approach the Argentine Government with a view toremoving differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an Americancorporation in the transmission between Buenos Ayres and the cities ofUruguay and Brazil of through messages passing from and to the UnitedStates. Although the matter is complicated by exclusive concessions byUruguay and Brazil to foreign companies, there is strong hope that a goodunderstanding will be reached and that the important channels of commercialcommunication between the United States and the Atlantic cities of SouthAmerica may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimination.In this relation I may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness ofan international agreement whereby the interchange of messages overconnecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity. The worldhas seen the postal system developed from a congeries of independent andexclusive services into a well ordered union, of which all countries enjoythe manifold benefits. It would be strange were the nations not in timebrought to realize that modern civilization, which owes so much of itsprogress to the annihilation of space by the electric force, demands thatthis all important means of communication be a heritage of all peoples, tobe administered and regulated in their common behoof. A step in thisdirection was taken when the international convention of 1884 for theprotection of submarine cables was signed, and the day is, I trust, not fardistant when this medium for the transmission of thought from land to landmay be brought within the domain of international concert as completely asis the material carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face ofthe waters that divide them.The claim of Thomas Jefferson Page against Argentina, which has beenpending many years, has been adjusted. The sum awarded by the Congress ofArgentina was $4,242.35.The sympathy of the American people has justly been offered to the rulerand the people of Austria Hungary by reason of the affliction that haslately befallen them in the assassination of the Empress Queen of thathistoric realm.On the 10th of September, 1897, a conflict took place at Lattimer, Pa.,between a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne County and hisdeputies, in which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded, of whom 10 of thekilled and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian subjects. Thisdeplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the Austro HungarianGovernment, which, on the assumption that the killing and wounding involvedthe unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed reparation for thesufferers. Apart from the searching investigation and peremptory action ofthe authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal Executive took appropriatesteps to learn the merits of the case, in order to be in a position to meetthe urgent complaint of a friendly power. The sheriff and his deputies,having been indicted for murder, were tried, and acquitted, afterprotracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses, on theground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to upholdlaw and preserve public order in the State. A representative of theDepartment of Justice attended the trial and reported its course fully.With all the facts in its possession, this Government expects to reach aharmonious understanding on the subject with that of Austria Hungary,notwithstanding the renewed claim of the latter, after learning the resultof the trial, for indemnity for its injured subjects.Despite the brief time allotted for preparation, the exhibits of thiscountry at the Universal Exposition at Brussels in 1897 enjoyed thesingular distinction of a larger proportion of awards, having regard to thenumber and classes of articles entered than those of other countries. Theworth of such a result in making known our national capacity to supply theworld\'s markets is obvious.Exhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent asthe exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied. Hardlya year passes that this Government is not invited to national participationat some important foreign center, but often on too short notice to permitof recourse to Congress for the power and means to do so. My predecessorshave suggested the advisability of providing by a general enactment and astanding appropriation for accepting such invitations and forrepresentation of this country by a commission. This plan has my cordialapproval.I trust that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from theUnited States, originally adopted as a sanitary precaution, will at anearly day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship anddiscrimination, so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of theirslaughter after landing. I am hopeful, too, of favorable change in theBelgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats. The growth of directtrade between the two countries, not alone for Belgian consumption andBelgian products, but by way of transit from and to other continentalstates, has been both encouraging and beneficial. No effort will be sparedto enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal of needless impedimentsand by arrangements for increased commercial exchanges.The year\'s events in Central America deserve more than passing mention.A menacing rupture between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was happily composed bythe signature of a convention between the parties, with the concurrence ofthe Guatemalan representative as a mediator, the act being negotiated andsigned on board the United States steamer Alert, then lying in CentralAmerican waters. It is believed that the good offices of our envoy and ofthe commander of that vessel contributed toward this gratifying outcome.In my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to thediplomatic representation of this Government in Central America created bythe association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador under the title of theGreater Republic of Central America, and the delegation of theirinternational functions to the Diet thereof. While the representativecharacter of the Diet was recognized by my predecessor and has beenconfirmed during my Administration by receiving its accredited envoy andgranting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under its authority, thatrecognition was qualified by the distinct understanding that theresponsibility of each of the component sovereign Republics toward theUnited States remained wholly unaffected.This proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three Republics wasat the outset an association whereby certain representative functions weredelegated to a tripartite commission rather than a federation possessingcentralized powers of government and administration. In this view of theirrelation and of the relation of the United States to the several Republics,a change in the representation of this country in Central America wasneither recommended by the Executive nor initiated by Congress, thusleaving one of our envoys accredited, as heretofore, separately to twoStates of the Greater Republic, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a thirdState, Costa Rica, which was not a party to the compact, while our otherenvoy was similarly accredited to a union State, Honduras, and a nonunionState, Guatemala. The result has been that the one has presentedcredentials only to the President of Costa Rica, the other having beenreceived only by the Government of Guatemala.Subsequently the three associated Republics entered into negotiations fortaking the steps forecast in the original compact. A convention of theirdelegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of theUnited States of Central America, and provided for a central federalgovernment and legislature. Upon ratification by the constituent States,the 1st of November last was fixed for the new system to go into operation.Within a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested by revolutionarymovements arising, with a consequent demand for unity of action on the partof the military power of the federal States to suppress them. Under thisstrain the new union seems to have been weakened through the withdrawal ofits more important members. This Government was not officially advised ofthe installation of the federation and has maintained an attitude offriendly expectancy, while in no wise relinquishing the position held fromthe outset that the responsibilities of the several States toward usremained unaltered by their tentative relations among themselves.The Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the chairmanship of Rear Admiral JohnG. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority of a provision inthe sundry civil act of June 4 of that year, has nearly completed itslabors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route,the feasibility, and the cost of construction of an interoceanic canal by aNicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the performance of its taskthe commission received all possible courtesy and assistance from theGovernments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus testified theirappreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome tothe great project that has for so many years engrossed the attention of therespective countries.As the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject, with the aimof making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient route, itnecessarily included a review of the results of previous surveys and plans,and in particular those adopted by the Maritime Canal Company under itsexisting concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so that to this extentthose grants necessarily hold as essential a part in the deliberations andconclusions of the Canal Commission as they have held and must needs holdin the discussion of the matter by the Congress. Under these circumstancesand in view of overtures made to the Governments of Nicaragua and CostaRica by other parties for a new canal concession predicated on the assumedapproaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal Company with thoseStates, I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerationsof expediency and international policy as between the several governmentsinterested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by thisroute require the maintenance of the status quo until the Canal Commissionshall have reported and the United States Congress shall have had theopportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the presentsession, without prejudice by reason of any change in the existingconditions.Nevertheless, it appears that the Government of Nicaragua, as one of itslast sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the newly formedUnited States of Central America, has granted an optional concession toanother association, to become effective on the expiration of the presentgrant. It does not appear what surveys have been made or what route isproposed under this contingent grant, so that an examination of thefeasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of theCanal Commission. All these circumstances suggest the urgency of somedefinite action by the Congress at this session if the labors of the pastare to be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by apractical waterway is to be realized. That the construction of such amaritime highway is now more than ever indispensable to that intimate andready intercommunication between our eastern and western seaboards demandedby the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the prospective expansion ofour influence and commerce in the Pacific, and that our national policy nowmore imperatively than ever calls for its control by this Government, arepropositions which I doubt not the Congress will duly appreciate and wiselyact upon.A convention providing for the revival of the late United States andChilean Claims Commission and the consideration of claims which were dulypresented to the late commission, but not considered because of theexpiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission, wassigned May 24, 1897, and has remained unacted upon by the Senate. The termtherein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having elapsed,the convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment, which I amendeavoring to bring about, with the friendly concurrence of the ChileanGovernment.The United States has not been an indifferent spectator of theextraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese Empire, whereby portions ofits maritime provinces are passing under the control of various Europeanpowers; but the prospect that the vast commerce which the energy of ourcitizens and the necessity of our staple productions for Chinese uses hasbuilt up in those regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusivetreatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of our countrybecoming an actor in the scene. Our position among nations, having a largePacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade with the fartherOrient, gives us the equitable claim to consideration and friendlytreatment in this regard, and it will be my aim to subserve our largeinterests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the constant policyof our Government. The territories of Kiao chow, of Wei hai wei, and ofPort Arthur and Talienwan, leased to Germany, Great Britain, and Russia,respectively, for terms of years, will, it is announced, be open tointernational commerce during such alien occupation; and if nodiscriminating treatment of American citizens and their trade be found toexist or be hereafter developed, the desire of this Government would appearto be realized.In this relation, as showing the volume and value of our exchanges withChina and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for theirexpansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the communicationaddressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the Secretaryof the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with its accompanying letter ofthe Secretary of State, recommending an appropriation for a commission tostudy the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese Empire andreport as to the opportunities for and obstacles to the enlargement ofmarkets in China for the raw products and manufactures of the UnitedStates. Action was not taken thereon during the late session. I cordiallyurge that the recommendation receive at your hands the consideration whichits importance and timeliness merit.Meanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrestand revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alienpeople which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces. As in the case ofthe attacks upon our citizens in Szechuen and at Kutien in 1895, the UnitedStates minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure ofprotection, both local and imperial, for any menaced American interests,and to demand, in case of lawless injury to person or property, instantreparation appropriate to the case. War ships have been stationed atTientsin for more ready observation of the disorders which have invadedeven the Chinese capital, so as to be in a position to act should needarise, while a guard of marines has been sent to Peking to afford theminister the same measure of authoritative protection as therepresentatives of other nations have been constrained to employ.Following close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor asarbitrator of the claim of the Italian subject Cerruti against the Republicof Colombia, differences arose between the parties to the arbitration inregard to the scope and extension of the award, of which certain articleswere contested by Colombia, while Italy claimed their literal fulfillment.The award having been made by the President of the United States, as an actof friendly consideration and with the sole view to an impartialcomposition of the matter in dispute, I could not but feel deep concern atsuch a miscarriage, and while unable to accept the Colombian theory that I,in my official capacity, possessed continuing functions as arbitrator, withpower to interpret or revise the terms of the award, my best efforts werelent to bring the parties to a harmonious agreement as to the execution ofits provisions.A naval demonstration by Italy resulted in an engagement to pay theliabilities claimed upon their ascertainment; but this apparent dispositionof the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic intercoursebetween Colombia and Italy, which still continues, although, fortunately,without acute symptoms having supervened. Notwithstanding this, efforts arereported to be continuing for the ascertainment of Colombia\'s contingentliability on account of Cerruti\'s debts under the fifth article of theaward.A claim of an American citizen against the Dominican Republic for a publicbridge over the Ozama River, which has been in diplomatic controversy forseveral years, has been settled by expert arbitration and an award in favorof the claimant amounting to about $90,000. It, however, remains unpaid,despite urgent demands for its settlement according to the terms of thecompact.There is now every prospect that the participation of the United States inthe Universal Exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a scalecommensurate with the advanced position held by our products and industriesin the world\'s chief marts.The preliminary report of Mr. Moses P. Handy, who, under the act approvedJuly 19, 1897, was appointed special commissioner with a view to securingall attainable information necessary to a full and complete understandingby Congress in regard to the participation of this Government in the ParisExposition, was laid before you by my message of December 6, 1897, andshowed the large opportunities opened to make known our national progressin arts, science, and manufactures, as well as the urgent need of immediateand adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be taken. Mr.Handy\'s death soon afterwards rendered it necessary for another to take upand complete his unfinished work, and on January 11 last Mr. Thomas W.Cridler, Third Assistant Secretary of State, was designated to fulfill thattask. His report was laid before you by my message of June 14, 1898, withthe gratifying result of awakening renewed interest in the projecteddisplay. By a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1,1898, a sum not to exceed $650,000 was allotted for the organization of acommission to care for the proper preparation and installation of Americanexhibits and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several ExecutiveDepartments, particularly by the Department of Agriculture, the FishCommission, and the Smithsonian Institution, in representation of theGovernment of the United States.Pursuant to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of Chicago,commissioner general, with an assistant commissioner general and asecretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his success inenlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhibit has been mostgratifying. Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of theexposition site less than one half that of the World\'s Fair atChicago the space assigned to the United States has been increased fromthe absolute allotment of 157,403 square feet reported by Mr. Handy to some202,000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field for atruly characteristic representation of the various important branches ofour country\'s development. Mr. Peck\'s report will be laid before you. In myjudgment its recommendations will call for your early consideration,especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to at least onemillion dollars in all, so that not only may the assigned space be fullytaken up by the best possible exhibits in every class, but the preparationand installation be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first inthat unparalleled competition of artistic and inventive production, andthus counterbalance the disadvantage with which we start as compared withother countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whosepreparations are in a state of much greater forwardness than our own.Where our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel, where our inventivegenius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these later daysof the century, and where the native resources of our land are as limitlessas they are valuable to supply the world\'s needs, it is our province, as itshould be our earnest care, to lead in the march of human progress, and notrest content with any secondary place. Moreover, if this be due toourselves, it is no less due to the great French nation whose guests webecome, and which has in so many ways testified its wish and hope that ourparticipation shall befit the place the two peoples have won in the fieldof universal development.The commercial arrangement made with France on the 28th of May, 1898, underthe provisions of section 3 of the tariff act of 1897, went into effect onthe 1st day of June following. It has relieved a portion of our exporttrade from serious embarrassment. Further negotiations are now pendingunder section 4 of the same act with a view to the increase of tradebetween the two countries to their mutual advantage. Negotiations withother governments, in part interrupted by the war with Spain, are inprogress under both sections of the tariff act. I hope to be able toannounce some of the results of these negotiations during the presentsession of Congress.Negotiations to the same end with Germany have been set on foot. Meanwhileno effort has been relaxed to convince the Imperial Government of thethoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation, and it istrusted that the efficient administration of this measure by the Departmentof Agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the healthfulness of thefood staples we send abroad to countries where their use is large andnecessary.I transmitted to the Senate on the 10th of February last informationtouching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from thiscountry, which had then recently been decreed by Germany on the ground ofdanger of disseminating the San Jose scale insect. This precautionarymeasure was justified by Germany on the score of the drastic steps taken inseveral States of the Union against the spread of the pest, the elaboratereports of the Department of Agriculture being put in evidence to show thedanger to German fruit growing interests should the scale obtain a lodgmentin that country. Temporary relief was afforded in the case of largeconsignments of fruit then on the way by inspection and admission whenfound noninfected. Later the prohibition was extended to dried fruits ofevery kind, but was relaxed so as to apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruitwaste. As was to be expected, the alarm reached to other countries, andSwitzerland has adopted a similar inhibition. Efforts are in progress toinduce the German and Swiss Governments to relax the prohibition in favorof dried fruits shown to have been cured under circumstances rendering theexistence of animal life impossible.Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendlyfooting. Assenting to our request, the protection of Americans and theirinterests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic andconsular representatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their delicate andarduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high commendation. I may beallowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr. Ramsden, HerMajesty\'s consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely death afterdistinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city wassincerely lamented.In the early part of April last, pursuant to a request made at the instanceof the Secretary of State by the British ambassador at this capital, theCanadian government granted facilities for the passage of four UnitedStates revenue cutters from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast by way ofthe Canadian canals and the St. Lawrence River. The vessels had reachedLake Ontario and were there awaiting the opening of navigation when war wasdeclared between the United States and Spain. Her Majesty\'s Governmentthereupon, by a communication of the latter part of April, stated that thepermission granted before the outbreak of hostilities would not bewithdrawn provided the United States Government gave assurance that thevessels in question would proceed direct to a United States port withoutengaging in any hostile operation. This Government promptly agreed to thestipulated condition, it being understood that the vessels would not beprohibited from resisting any hostile attack.It will give me especial satisfaction if I shall be authorized tocommunicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations withGreat Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. It is the earnest wishof this Government to remove all sources of discord and irritation in ourrelations with the neighboring Dominion. The trade between the twocountries is constantly increasing, and it is important to both countriesthat all reasonable facilities should be granted for its development.The Government of Greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty hereimposed upon the currants of that country, amounting to 100 per cent ormore of their market value. This fruit is stated to be exclusively a Greekproduct, not coming into competition with any domestic product. Thequestion of reciprocal commercial relations with Greece, including therestoration of currants to the free list, is under consideration.The long standing claim of Bernard Campbell for damages for injuriessustained from a violent assault committed against him by militaryauthorities in the island of Haiti has been settled by the agreement ofthat Republic to pay him $10,000 in American gold. Of this sum $5,000 hasalready been paid. It is hoped that other pending claims of Americancitizens against that Republic may be amicably adjusted.Pending the consideration by the Senate of the treaty signed June 1897, bythe plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic of Hawaii,providing for the annexation of the islands, a joint resolution toaccomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered cession andincorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted by theCongress and approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon directed the United Statessteamship Philadelphia to convey Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu, andintrusted to his hands this important legislative act, to be delivered tothe President of the Republic of Hawaii, with whom the Admiral and theUnited States minister were authorized to make appropriate arrangements fortransferring the sovereignty of the islands to the United States. This wassimply but impressively accomplished on the 12th of August last by thedelivery of a certified copy of the resolution to President Dole, whothereupon yielded up to the representative of the Government of the UnitedStates the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands.Pursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of theauthority thereby conferred upon me, I directed that the civil, judicial,and military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of the Governmentof the Republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised by those officersuntil Congress shall provide a government for the incorporated territory,subject to my power to remove such officers and to fill vacancies. ThePresident, officers, and troops of the Republic thereupon took the oath ofallegiance to the United States, thus providing for the uninterruptedcontinuance of all the administrative and municipal functions of theannexed territory until Congress shall otherwise enact.Following the further provision of the joint resolution, I appointed theHons. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, John T. Morgan, of Alabama, Robert R.Hitt, of Illinois, Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F. Frear, ofHawaii, as commissioners to confer and recommend to Congress suchlegislation concerning the Hawaiian Islands as they should deem necessaryor proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them,their report will be laid before you at an early day. It is believed thattheir recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to themagnitude of the responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to therelationship of those mid Pacific lands to our home Union as will benefitboth in the highest degree, realizing the aspirations of the community thathas cast its lot with us and elected to share our political heritage, whileat the same time justifying the foresight of those who for three quartersof a century have looked to the assimilation of Hawaii as a natural andinevitable consummation, in harmony with our needs and in fulfillment ofour cherished traditions.The questions heretofore pending between Hawaii and Japan growing out ofthe alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants were, I am pleasedto say, adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonableindemnity to the Government of Japan.Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the existing customsrelations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with othercountries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide. Theconsuls of Hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill theircommercial agencies, while the United States consulate at Honolulu ismaintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and therevenue. It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the HawaiianIslands should receive new exequaturs from this Government.The attention of Congress is called to the fact that, our consular officeshaving ceased to exist in Hawaii and being about to cease in othercountries coming under the sovereignty of the United States, the provisionsfor the relief and transportation of destitute American seamen in thesecountries under our consular regulations will in consequence terminate. Itis proper, therefore, that new legislation should be enacted upon thissubject in order to meet the changed conditions.The interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention ofDecember 11, 1861, has been at various times the occasion of controversywith the Government of Mexico. An acute difference arose in the case of theMexican demand for the delivery of Jesus Guerra, who, having led amarauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed purpose ofinitiating an insurrection against President Diaz, escaped into Texas.Extradition was refused on the ground that the alleged offense waspolitical in its character, and therefore came within the treaty proviso ofnonsurrender. The Mexican contention was that the exception only related topurely political offenses, and that as Guerra\'s acts were admixed with thecommon crime of murder, arson, kidnaping, and robbery, the option ofnondelivery became void, a position which this Government was unable toadmit in view of the received international doctrine and practice in thematter. The Mexican Government, in view of this, gave notice January 24,1898, of the termination of the convention, to take effect twelve monthsfrom that date, at the same time inviting the conclusion of a newconvention, toward which negotiations are on foot.In this relation I may refer to the necessity of some amendment of ourexisting extradition statute. It is a common stipulation of such treatiesthat neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens, with theadded proviso in one of our treaties, that with Japan, that it maysurrender if it see fit. It is held in this country by an almost uniformcourse of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation tosurrender the President is not invested with legal authority to act. Theconferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound moralitywhich shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a heinouscrime. Again, statutory provision might well be made for what is styledextradition by way of transit, whereby a fugitive surrendered by oneforeign government to another may be conveyed across the territory of theUnited States to the jurisdiction of the demanding state. A recommendationin this behalf made in the President\'s message of 1886 was not acted upon.The matter is presented for your consideration.The problem of the Mexican free zone has been often discussed with regardto its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the United Statesalong an extensive and thinly guarded land border. The effort made by thejoint resolution of March 1, 1895, to remedy the abuse charged bysuspending the privilege of free transportation in bond across theterritory of the United States to Mexico failed of good result, as isstated in Report No. 702 of the House of Representatives, submitted in thelast session, March 11, 1898. As the question is one to be conveniently metby wise concurrent legislation of the two countries looking to theprotection of the revenues by harmonious measures operating equally oneither side of the boundary, rather than by conventional arrangements, Isuggest that Congress consider the advisability of authorizing and invitinga conference of representatives of the Treasury Departments of the UnitedStates and Mexico to consider the subject in all its complex bearings, andmake report with pertinent recommendations to the respective Governmentsfor the information and consideration of their Congresses.The Mexican Water Boundary Commission has adjusted all matters submitted toit to the satisfaction of both Governments save in three importantcases that of the "Chamizal" at El Paso, Tex., where the two commissionersfailed to agree, and wherein, for this case only, this Government hasproposed to Mexico the addition of a third member; the proposed eliminationof what are known as "Bancos," small isolated islands formed by the cuttingoff of bends in the Rio Grande, from the operation of the treaties of 1884and 1889, recommended by the commissioners and approved by this Government,but still under consideration by Mexico; and the subject of the "Equitabledistribution of the waters of the Rio Grande," for which the commissionersrecommended an international dam and reservoir, approved by Mexico, butstill under consideration by this Government. Pending these questions it isnecessary to extend the life of the commission, which expires December 23next.The coronation of the young Queen of the Netherlands was made the occasionof fitting congratulations.The claim of Victor H. McCord against Peru, which for a number of years hasbeen pressed by this Government and has on several occasions attracted theattention of the Congress, has been satisfactorily adjusted. A protocol wassigned May 17, 1898, whereby, the fact of liability being admitted, thequestion of the amount to be awarded was submitted to the chief justice ofCanada as sole arbitrator. His award sets the indemnity due the claimant at$40,000.The Government of Peru has given the prescribed notification of itsintention to abrogate the treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigationconcluded with this country August 31, 1887. As that treaty contains manyimportant provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce and goodrelations, which could with difficulty be replaced by the negotiation ofrenewed provisions within the brief twelve months intervening before thetreaty terminates, I have invited suggestions by Peru as to the particularprovisions it is desired to annul, in the hope of reaching an arrangementwhereby the remaining articles may be provisionally saved.His Majesty the Czar having announced his purpose to raise the ImperialRussian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy, I responded,under the authority conferred by the act of March 3, 1893, by commissioningand accrediting the actual representative at St. Petersburg in the capacityof ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. The Russian ambassador tothis country has since presented his credentials.The proposal of the Czar for a general reduction of the vast militaryestablishments that weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of peace wascommunicated to this Government with an earnest invitation to berepresented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with aview to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result. HisMajesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this Governmentwith the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness ofthe United States to take part in the conference. The active military forceof the United States, as measured by our population, territorial area, andtaxable wealth, is, and under any conceivable prospective conditions mustcontinue to be, in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of thearmed powers to whom the Czar\'s appeal is especially addressed that thequestion can have for us no practical importance save as marking anauspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modernpeoples and the cultivation of peace and good will among them; but in thisview it behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to thebeneficent project.The claims of owners of American sealing vessels for seizure by Russiancruisers in Bering Sea are being pressed to a settlement. The equities ofthe cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation willeventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of theproven facts.The recommendation made in my special message of April 27 last is renewed,that appropriation be made to reimburse the master and owners of theRussian bark Hans for wrongful arrest of the master and detention of thevessel in February, 1896, by officers of the United States district courtfor the southern district of Mississippi. The papers accompanying my saidmessage make out a most meritorious claim and justify the urgency withwhich it has been presented by the Government of Russia.Malietoa Laupepa, King of Samoa, died on August 22 last. According toArticle I of the general act of Berlin, "his successor shall be dulyelected according to the laws and customs of Samoa."Arrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the generalact for the return of Mataafa and the other exiled Samoan chiefs, they werebrought from Jaluit by a German war vessel and landed at Apia on September18 last.Whether the death of Malietoa and the return of his old time rival Mataafawill add to the undesirable complications which the execution of thetripartite general act has heretofore developed remains to be seen. Theefforts of this Government will, as heretofore, be addressed toward aharmonious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the internationalengagement to which the United States became a party in 1889.The Cheek claim against Siam, after some five years of controversy, hasbeen adjusted by arbitration under an agreement signed July 6, 1897, anaward of 706,721 ticals (about $187,987.78 ), with release of the Cheekestate from mortgage claims, having been rendered March 21, 1898, in favorof the claimant by the arbitrator, Sir Nicholas John Hannen, British chiefjustice for China and Japan.An envoy from Siam has been accredited to this Government and has presentedhis credentials.Immediately upon the outbreak of the war with Spain the Swiss Government,fulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the patron of theInternational Red Cross, proposed to the United States and Spain that theyshould severally recognize and carry into execution, as a modus vivendi,during the continuance of hostilities, the additional articles proposed bythe international conference of Geneva, October 20, 1868, extending theeffects of the existing Red Cross convention of 1864 to the conduct ofnaval war. Following the example set by France and Germany in 1870 inadopting such a modus vivendi, and in view of the accession of the UnitedStates to those additional articles in 1882, although the exchange ofratifications thereof still remained uneffected, the Swiss proposal waspromptly and cordially accepted by us, and simultaneously by Spain.This Government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled totestify its adherence to the broadest principles of humanity even amidstthe clash of war, and it is to be hoped that the extension of the Red Crosscompact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become anaccomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional navalRed Cross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the convention of1864.The important question of the claim of Switzerland to the perpetualcantonal allegiance of American citizens of Swiss origin has not madehopeful progress toward a solution, and controversies in this regard stillcontinue.The newly accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman Portecarries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in controversy withTurkey for a number of years. He is especially charged to press for a justsettlement of our claims for indemnity by reason of the destruction of theproperty of American missionaries resident in that country during theArmenian troubles of 1895, as well as for the recognition of older claimsof equal justness.He is also instructed to seek an adjustment of the dispute growing out ofthe refusal of Turkey to recognize the acquired citizenship of Ottoman bornpersons naturalized in the United States since 1869 without prior imperialconsent, and in the same general relation he is directed to endeavor tobring about a solution of the question which has more or less acutelyexisted since 1869 concerning the jurisdictional rights of the UnitedStates in matters of criminal procedure and punishment under Article IV ofthe treaty of 1830. This latter difficulty grows out of a verbaldifference, claimed by Turkey to be essential, between the original Turkishtext and the promulgated translation.After more than two years from the appointment of a consul of this countryto Erzerum, he has received his exequatur.The arbitral tribunal appointed under the treaty of February 2, 1897,between Great Britain and Venezuela, to determine the boundary line betweenthe latter and the colony of British Guiana, is to convene at Paris duringthe present month. It is a source of much gratification to this Governmentto see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to the settlement of thiscontroversy, not alone because of the earnest part we have had in bringingabout the result, but also because the two members named on behalf ofVenezuela, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice Brewer, chosen from ourhighest court, appropriately testify the continuing interest we feel in thedefinitive adjustment of the question according to the strictest rules ofjustice. The British members, Lord Herschell and Sir Richard Collins, arejurists of no less exalted repute, while the fifth member and president ofthe tribunal, M. F. De Martens, has earned a world wide reputation as anauthority upon international law.The claim of Felipe Scandella against Venezuela for arbitrary expulsion andinjury to his business has been adjusted by the revocation of the order ofexpulsion and by the payment of the sum of $16,000.I have the satisfaction of being able to state that the Bureau of theAmerican Republics, created in 1890 as the organ for promoting commercialintercourse and fraternal relations among the countries of the WesternHemisphere, has become a more efficient instrument of the wise purposes ofits founders, and is receiving the cordial support of the contributingmembers of the international union which are actually represented in itsboard of management. A commercial directory, in two volumes, containing amass of statistical matter descriptive of the industrial and commercialinterests of the various countries, has been printed in English, Spanish,Portuguese, and French, and a monthly bulletin published in these fourlanguages and distributed in the Latin American countries as well as in theUnited States has proved to be a valuable medium for disseminatinginformation and furthering the varied interests of the internationalunion.During the past year the important work of collecting information ofpractical benefit to American industries and trade through the agency ofthe diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily advanced, and inorder to lay such data before the public with the least delay the practicewas begun in January, 1898, of issuing the commercial reports from day today as they are received by the Department of State. It is believed thatfor promptitude as well as fullness of information the service thussupplied to our merchants and manufacturers will be found to show sensibleimprovement and to merit the liberal support of Congress.The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of theburdens and the waste of war. We desire, in common with most civilizednations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained intime of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It is true we may suffer insuch cases less than other communities, but all nations are damaged more orless by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak ofhostilities throws the entire commercial world. It should be our object,therefore, to minimize, so far as practicable, this inevitable loss anddisturbance. This purpose can probably best be accomplished by aninternational agreement to regard all private property at sea as exemptfrom capture or destruction by the forces of belligerent powers. The UnitedStates Government has for many years advocated this humane and beneficentprinciple, and is now in position to recommend it to other powers withoutthe imputation of selfish motives. I therefore suggest for yourconsideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond with thegovernments of the principal maritime powers with a view of incorporatinginto the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemptionof all private property at sea, not contraband of war, from capture ordestruction by belligerent powers.The Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the Governmentfrom all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, including$64,751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroads, amounted to$405,321,335, and its expenditures to $443,168,582. There was collectedfrom customs $149,575,062 and from internal revenue $170,900,641. Ourdutiable imports amounted to $324,635,479, a decrease of $58,156,690 overthe preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $291,414,175,a decrease from the preceding year of $90,524,068. Internal revenuereceipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $24,212,067.The total tax collected on distilled spirits was $92,546,999; onmanufactured tobacco, $36,230,522, and on fermented liquors, $39,515,421.We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $1,231,482,330, anincrease of $180,488,774 from the preceding year.It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts ofthe Government for the year ending June 30, 1899, will be $577,874,647, andits expenditures $689,874,647, resulting in a deficiency of $112,000,000.On the 1st of December, 1898, there was held in the Treasury gold coinamounting to $138,441,547, gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545, silverbullion amounting to $93,359,250, and other forms of money amounting to$451,963,981.On the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or notincluded in Treasury holdings, was $1,886,879,504, an increase for the yearof $165,794,966. Estimating our population at 75,194,000 at the timementioned, the per capita circulation was $25.09. On the same date therewas in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545.The provisions made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury inconnection with the war have given increased confidence in the purpose andpower of the Government to maintain the present standard, and haveestablished more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. Amarked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the Treasury. Itsnet gold holdings on November 1, 1898, were $239,885,162 as compared with$153,573,147 on November 1, 1897, and an increase of net cash of$207,756,100, November 1, 1897, to $300,238,275, November 1, 1898. Thepresent ratio of net Treasury gold to outstanding Government liabilities,including United States notes, Treasury notes of 1890, silver certificates,currency certificates, standard silver dollars, and fractional silver coin,November 1, 1898, was 25.35 per cent, as compared with 16.96 per cent,November 1, 1897.I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows: Thatwhen any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in goldand are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and onlypaid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder ofthe United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government, heshould not receive back from the Government a United States note withoutpaying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the moreapparent when the Government issues an interest bearing debt to providegold for the redemption of United States notes a non interest bearingdebt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and forgold. If they are put out in any other way, they may return again, to hefollowed by another bond issue to redeem them another interest bearingdebt to redeem a non interest bearing debt. This recommendation was made inthe belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree thesafety of the present standard, and better protect our currency from thedangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general businessconditions of the country.In my judgment the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies theimmediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago, underwhich a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund fromwhich greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when onceredeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold.It is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency isnot required; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand for it.The importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future amoney standard related as our money standard now is to that of ourcommercial rivals is generally recognized.The companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be keptsafe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internalcommerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a propositionscarcely less important. The subject, in all its parts, is commended to thewise consideration of the Congress.The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States toCuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines resulting from the war, compel theprompt adoption of a maritime policy by the United States. There should beestablished regular and frequent steamship communication, encouraged by theUnited States, under the American flag, with the newly acquired islands.Spain furnished to its colonies, at an annual cost of about $2,000,000,steamship lines communicating with a portion of the world\'s markets, aswell as with trade centers of the home Government. The United States willnot undertake to do less. It is our duty to furnish the people of Hawaiiwith facilities, under national control, for their export and import trade.It will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation whichshall be prompt, durable, and liberal.The part which American merchant vessels and their seamen performed in thewar with Spain demonstrates that this service, furnishing both pickets andthe second line of defense, is a national necessity, and should beencouraged in every constitutional way. Details and methods for theaccomplishment of this purpose are discussed in the report of the Secretaryof the Treasury, to which the attention of Congress is respectfullyinvited.In my last annual message I recommended that Congress authorize theappointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematicinvestigations with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever.This matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of themilitary occupation of the island of Cuba and the commercial intercoursebetween this island and the United States which we have every reason toexpect. The sanitary problems connected with our new relations with theisland of Cuba and the acquisition of Puerto Rico are no less importantthan those relating to finance, commerce, and administration. It is myearnest desire that these problems may be considered by competent expertsand that everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitaryscience can offer for the protection of the health of our soldiers in thoseislands and of our citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infectionfrom the importation of yellow fever. I therefore renew my recommendationthat the authority of Congress may be given and a suitable appropriationmade to provide for a commission of experts to be appointed for the purposeindicated.Under the act of Congress approved April 26, 1898, authorizing thePresident in his discretion, "upon a declaration of war by Congress, or adeclaration by Congress that war exists," I directed the increase of theRegular Army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act.There are now in the Regular Army 57,862 officers and men. In said act itwas provided That at the end of any war in which the United States may becomeinvolved the Army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transferin the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorabledischarge, under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish, ofsupernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or transferof supernumerary enlisted men; and nothing contained in this act shall beconstrued as authorizing the permanent increase of the commissioned orenlisted force of the Regular Army beyond that now provided by the law inforce prior to the passage of this act, except as to the increase oftwenty five majors provided for in section 1 hereof. The importance oflegislation for the permanent increase of the Army is therefore manifest,and the recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose has myunqualified approval. There can be no question that at this time, andprobably for some time in the future, 100,000 men will be none too many tomeet the necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that numbershall be required permanently or not, the power should be given to thePresident to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary;and the further discretion should be given him to recruit for the Armywithin the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with thegovernment of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out theentire Volunteer Army as soon as the Congress shall provide for theincrease of the regular establishment. This will be only an act of justiceand will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes andemployments to help the country in its emergency.In my last annual message I stated: The Union Pacific Railway, main line,was sold under the decree of the United States court for the district ofNebraska on the 1st and 2d of November of this year. The amount due theGovernment consisted of the principal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512,and the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,711.75, making the totalindebtedness $58,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered the first mortgagelien and the entire mortgage claim of the Government, principal andinterest. This left the Kansas Pacific case unconcluded. By a decree of thecourt in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum whichwould yield to the Government only $2,500,000 upon its lien. The sale, atthe instance of the Government, was postponed first to December 15, 1897,and later, upon the application of the United States, was postponed to the16th day of February, 1898.Having satisfied myself that the interests of the Government required thatan effort should be made to obtain a larger sum, I directed the Secretaryof the Treasury, under the act passed March 3, 1887, to pay out of theTreasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the amounts due uponall prior mortgages upon the Eastern and Middle divisions of said railroadout of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, whereupon theAttorney General prepared a petition to be presented to the court, offeringto redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct, andpraying that thereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated toall the rights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might beappointed to take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain andoperate the same until the court or Congress otherwise directed. Thereuponthe reorganization committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn andthe sale allowed to proceed on the 16th of February, 1898, they would bid asum at the sale which would realize to the Government the entire principalof its debt, $6,303,000.Believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating thedifficulties under which the Government would labor if it should become thepurchaser of the road at the sale, in the absence of any authority byCongress to take charge of and operate the road I directed that upon theguaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the principal ofits debt the sale should proceed. By this transaction the Governmentsecured an advance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum which the court hadfixed as the upset price, and which the reorganization committee haddeclared was the maximum which they would pay for the property.It is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against theUnion Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the Government hasreceived on account of its subsidy claim the sum of $64,751,223.75, anincrease of $18,997,163.76 over the sum which the reorganization committeeoriginally agreed to bid for the joint property, the Government receivingits whole claim, principal and interest, on the Union Pacific, and theprincipal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific Railroad.Steps had been taken to foreclose the Government\'s lien upon the CentralPacific Railroad Company, but before action was commenced Congress passedan act, approved July 7, 1898, creating a commission consisting of theSecretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of theInterior, and their successors in office, with full power to settle theindebtedness to the Government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid ofthe construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond aidedrailroads, subject to the approval of the President.No report has yet been made to me by the commission thus created. Whateveraction is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordancewith the act referred to will be duly submitted to the Congress.I deem it my duty to call to the attention of Congress the condition of thepresent building occupied by the Department of Justice. The business ofthat Department has increased very greatly since it was established in itspresent quarters. The building now occupied by it is neither large enoughnor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of the business ofthe Department. The Supervising Architect has pronounced it unsafe andunsuited for the use to which it is put. The Attorney General in his reportstates that the library of the Department is upon the fourth floor, andthat all the space allotted to it is so crowded with books as todangerously overload the structure. The first floor is occupied by theCourt of Claims. The building is of an old and dilapidated appearance,unsuited to the dignity which should attach to this important Department.A proper regard for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the officersand employees would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money inthe erection of a new building of commodious proportions and handsomeappearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for thatpurpose, including the ground occupied by the present structure andadjoining vacant lot, comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet onPennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 feet.In this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodationsprovided for the Supreme Court in the Capitol, and suggest the wisdom ofmaking provision for the erection of a separate building for the court andits officers and library upon available ground near the Capitol.The postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth.Within twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of thePost Office Department have multiplied threefold. In the last ten yearsthey have nearly doubled. Our postal business grows much more rapidly thanour population. It now involves an expenditure of $100,000,000 a year,numbers 73,000 post offices, and enrolls 200,000 employees. This remarkableextension of a service which is an accurate index of the public conditionspresents gratifying evidence of the advancement of education, of theincrease of communication and business activity, and of the improvement ofmail facilities leading to their constantly augmenting use.The war with Spain laid new and exceptional labors on the Post OfficeDepartment. The mustering of the military and naval forces of the UnitedStates required special mail arrangements for every camp and everycampaign. The communication between home and camp was naturally eager andexpectant. In some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as 50,000letters a day required handling. This necessity was met by the promptdetail and dispatch of experienced men from the established force and bydirecting all the instrumentalities of the railway mail and post officeservice, so far as necessary, to this new need. Congress passed an actempowering the postmaster General to establish offices or branches at everymilitary camp or station, and under this authority the postal machinery wasspeedily put into effective operation.Under the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Puerto Rico, andthe Philippines they were attended and followed by the postal service.Though the act of Congress authorized the appointment of postmasters wherenecessary, it was early determined that the public interests would best besubserved, not by new designations, but by the detail of experienced menfamiliar with every branch of the service, and this policy was steadilyfollowed. When the territory which was the theater of conflict came intoour possession, it became necessary to reestablish mail facilities for theresident population as well as to provide them for our forces ofoccupation, and the former requirement was met through the extension andapplication of the latter obligation. I gave the requisite authority, andthe same general principle was applied to this as to other branches ofcivil administration under military occupation. The details are moreparticularly given in the report of the postmaster General, and, while thework is only just begun, it is pleasing to be able to say that the servicein the territory which has come under our control is already materiallyimproved.The following recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy relative to theincrease of the Navy have my earnest approval:1. Three seagoing sheathed and coppered battle ships of about 13,500 tonstrial displacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnancefor vessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable speed andgreat radius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament,$3,600,000 each.2. Three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12,000 tons trialdisplacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance forvessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable speed and greatradius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament,$4,000,000 each.3. Three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6,000 tons trialdisplacement, to have the highest practicable speed and great radius ofaction, and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable for vessels oftheir class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament, $2,150,000each.4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about 2,500 tons trialdisplacement, to have the highest speed compatible with good cruisingqualities, great radius of action, and to carry the most powerful ordnancesuited to vessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armament,$1,141,800 each.I join with the Secretary of the Navy in recommending that grades ofadmiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived, to be filled by officerswho have specially distinguished themselves in the war with Spain.I earnestly urge upon Congress the importance of early legislationproviding for the taking of the Twelfth Census. This is necessary in viewof the large amount of work which must be performed in the preparation ofthe schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population.There were on the pension rolls on June 30, 1898, 993,714 names, anincrease of nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls on the same day ofthe preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of December 22,1896, for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year of 1898 was$140,000,000. Eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and seventy twodollars and forty six cents was appropriated by the act of March 31, 1898,to cover deficiencies in army pensions, and repayments in the sum of$12,020.33, making a total of $148,082,892.79 available for the payment ofpensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount disbursed from that sumwas $144,651,879.80, leaving a balance of $3,431,012.99 unexpended on the30th of June, 1898, which was covered into the Treasury. There were 389names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at thesecond session of the Fifty fifth Congress, making a total of 6,486pensioners by Congressional enactments since 1861.The total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were$1,253,948.44. The expenditures were $1,081,633.79, leaving a surplus of$172,314.65.The public lands disposed of by the Government during the year reached8,453,896.92 acres, an increase of 614,780.26 acres over the previous year.The total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amounted to$2,277,995.18, an increase of $190,063.90 over the preceding year. Thelands embraced in the eleven forest reservations which were suspended bythe act of June 4, 1897, again became subject to the operations of theproclamations of February 22, 1897, creating them, which added an estimatedamount of 19,951,360 acres to the area embraced in the reserves previouslycreated. In addition thereto two new reserves were created during theyear the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Reserve, in California, embracing1,644,594 acres, and the Prescott Reserve, in Arizona, embracing 10,240acres while the Pecos River Reserve, in New Mexico, has been changed andenlarged to include 120,000 additional acres.At the close of the year thirty forest reservations, not including those ofthe Afognak Forest and the Fish Culture Reserve, in Alaska, had beencreated by Executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3,1891, embracing an estimated area of 40,719,474 acres.The Department of the Interior has inaugurated a forest system, madepossible by the act of July, 1898, for a graded force of officers incontrol of the reserves. This system has only been in full operation sinceAugust, but good results have already been secured in many sections. Thereports received indicate that the system of patrol has not only preventeddestructive fires from gaining headway, but has diminished the number offires.The special attention of the Congress is called to that part of the reportof the Secretary of the Interior in relation to the Five Civilized Tribes.It is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows markedprogress. But one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year,and that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, which happily has beensuppressed.While it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of theact of June 28, 1898, "for the protection of the people of the IndianTerritory, and for other purposes," it is having a salutary effect upon thenations composing the five tribes. The Dawes Commission reports that themost gratifying results and greater advance toward the attainment of theobjects of the Government have been secured in the past year than in anyprevious year. I can not too strongly indorse the recommendation of thecommission and of the Secretary of the Interior for the necessity ofproviding for the education of the 30,000 white children resident in theIndian Territory.The Department of Agriculture has been active in the past year. Explorershave been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Westernhemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States,and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products.The Forestry Division of the Department is giving special attention to thetreeless regions of our country and is introducing species speciallyadapted to semiarid regions. Forest fires, which seriously interfere withproduction, especially in irrigated regions, are being studied, that lossesfrom this cause may be avoided. The Department is inquiring into the useand abuse of water in many States of the West, and collating informationregarding the laws of the States, the decisions of the courts, and thecustoms of the people in this regard, so that uniformity may be secured.Experiment stations are becoming more effective every year. The annualappropriation of $720,000 by Congress is supplemented by $400,000 from theStates. Nation wide experiments have been conducted to ascertain thesuitableness as to soil and climate and States for growing sugar beets. Thenumber of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years, and theability of the United States to produce its own sugar from this source hasbeen clearly demonstrated.The Weather Bureau forecast and observation stations have been extendedaround the Caribbean Sea, to give early warning of the approach ofhurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine.In the year 1900 will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding ofthe city of Washington for the permanent capital of the Government of theUnited States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 16, 1790. InMay, 1800, the archives and general offices of the Federal Government wereremoved to this place. On the 17th of November, 1800, the National Congressmet here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the Federaldistrict and city. This interesting event assumes all the more significancewhen we recall the circumstances attending the choosing of the site, thenaming of the capital in honor of the Father of his Country, and theinterest taken by him in the adoption of plans for its future developmenton a magnificent scale.These original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and asignal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen. Thepeople of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty andgovernment of the capital and of the rare instruments of science andeducation which here find their natural home.A movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversarycelebrated with fitting ceremonies, including, perhaps, the establishmentof a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion and togive it more than local recognition, has met with general favor on the partof the public.I recommend to the Congress the granting of an appropriation for thispurpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies. Itmight also be advisable to authorize the President to appoint a committeefrom the country at large, which, acting with the Congressional andDistrict of Columbia committees, can complete the plans for an appropriatenational celebration.The alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment; ameasure providing better protection for seamen is proposed; the rightfulapplication of the eight hour law for the benefit of labor and of theprinciple of arbitration are suggested for consideration; and I commendthese subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.The several departmental reports will be laid before you. They give ingreat detail the conduct of the affairs of the Government during the pastyear and discuss many questions upon which the Congress may feel calledupon to act.
William McKinley
To the Senate and House of Representatives:At the threshold of your deliberations you are called to mourn with yourcountrymen the death of Vice President Hobart, who passed from this life onthe morning of November 21 last. His great soul now rests in eternal peace.His private life was pure and elevated, while his public career was everdistinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and exalted motives.He has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified,but his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose, andnoble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and example.The Fifty sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with thecountry in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will amongthe people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with everygovernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase involume and value. The combined imports and exports for the year are thelargest ever shown by a single year in all our history. Our exports for1899 alone exceeded by more than a billion dollars our imports and exportscombined in 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in 1870,while the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870, showing theenlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its ownincreasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples ofother nations.Exports of agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufacturedproducts we exported in value $339,592,146, being larger than any previousyear. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history whenthe products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroadwere 1898 and 1899.Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1899, including $11,798,314,14, part payment of the Central PacificRailroad indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.35. Customs receipts were$206,128,481.75, and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51.For the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving adeficit of $89,111,559.67.The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the currentfiscal year will aggregate $640,958,112, and upon the basis of presentappropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958,112, leaving asurplus of $40,000,000.For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the internal revenue receipts wereincreased about $100,000,000.The present gratifying strength of the Treasury is shown by the fact thaton December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, Ofwhich $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions ofconfidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into moregeneral use and customs receipts are now almost entirely paid in thatcoin.The strong position of the Treasury with respect to cash on hand and thefavorable showing made by the revenues have made it possible for theSecretary of the Treasury to take action under the provisions of section3694, Revised Statutes, relating to the sinking fund. Receipts exceededexpenditures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by$13,413,389.91, and, as mentioned above, the Secretary of the Treasuryestimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at theend of the year. Under such conditions it was deemed advisable and properto resume compliance with the provisions of the sinking fund law, which foreight years has not been done because of deficiencies in the revenues. TheTreasury Department therefore offered to purchase during November$25,000,000 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent funded loanof 1907, at the current market price. The amount offered and purchasedduring November was $18,408,600. The premium paid by the Government on suchpurchases was $2,263,521 and the net saving in interest was about$2,885,000. The success of this operation was sufficient to induce theGovernment to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and including the 23dday of December, instant, unless the remainder of the $25,000,000 calledfor should be presented in the meantime for redemption.Increased activity in industry, with its welcome attendant a largeremployment for labor at higher wages gives to the body of the people alarger power to absorb the circulating medium. It is further true that yearby year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the increasing volumeof agricultural products, cotton, corn, and wheat, calls for a largervolume of money supply. This is especially noticeable at thecrop harvesting and crop moving period.In its earlier history the National Banking Act seemed to prove areasonable avenue through which needful additions to the circulation couldfrom time to time be made. Changing conditions have apparently rendered itnow inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond securities required,resulting from large premiums which Government bonds command in the market,or the tax on note issues, or both operating together, appear to be theinfluences which impair its public utility.The attention of Congress is respectfully invited to this important matter,with the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modificationscan be made in the National Banking Act as will render its service in theparticulars here referred to more responsive to the people\'s needs. I againurge that national banks be authorized to organize with a capital of$25,000.I urgently recommend that to support the existing gold standard, and tomaintain "the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold andsilver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market andin the payment of debts," the Secretary of the Treasury be given additionalpower and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employsuch other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The authorityshould include the power to sell bonds on long and short time, asconditions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lowerthan that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875. While there is now nocommercial fright which withdraws gold from the Government, but, on thecontrary, such widespread confidence that gold seeks the Treasury demandingpaper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present asthe most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuanceof the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose ofthe Government to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilizedworld recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of the Governmentare conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United Statesbonds and use gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of allthe money issued or coined by authority of the Government. We are doingthese things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are notcompelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past,however, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore,to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, andthe best means are those which are the most certain and economical. Thosenow authorized have the virtue neither of directness nor economy. We havealready eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight andembarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896. Our receipts nowequal our expenditures; deficient revenues no longer create alarm Let usremove the only remaining cause by conferring the full and necessary poweron the Secretary of the Treasury and impose upon him the duty to uphold thepresent gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a paritywith each other, which is the repeatedly declared policy of the UnitedStates.In this connection I repeat my former recommendations that a portion of thegold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shallbe redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not thereafterbe paid out except for gold.The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our commercialtrade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea invites the immediateaction of the Congress. Our national development will be one sided andunsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our inland industriesremains unaccompanied by progress on the seas. There is no lack ofconstitutional authority for legislation which shall give to the countrymaritime strength commensurate with its industrial achievements and withits rank among the nations of the earth,The past year has recorded exceptional activity in our shipyards, and thepromises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abundant. Advancedlegislation for the protection of our seamen has been enacted. Our coasttrade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the Governmentand since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequaled in our recordsor those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportunities,however, if we complacently regard only matters at home and blind ourselvesto the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade ofthe world.Last year American vessels transported a smaller share of our exports andimports than during any former year in all our history, and the measure ofour dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to ourpeople. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the Departmentsof the Government charged with military and naval operations in the Eastand West Indies had to obtain from foreign flags merchant vessels essentialfor those operations.The other great nations have not hesitated to adopt the required means todevelop their shipping as a factor in national defense and as one of thesurest and speediest means of obtaining for their producers a share inforeign markets. Like vigilance and effort on our part cannot fail toimprove our situation, which is regarded with humiliation at home and withsurprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the beginning may beinvolved, will be offset later by more than equivalent gains.The expense is as nothing compared to the advantage to be achieved. Thereestablishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure ourcontinued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial triumphs.I am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to ourmerchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuildour sea carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture;which, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and wages to ourcountrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part ofthe world.Combinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions oftrade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production, anddetermine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, arejustly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention ofthe Congress.The Industrial Commission, created by the act of the Congress of June 18,1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questionsinvolved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade andcompetition. They have not yet completed their investigation of thissubject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arriveare undetermined.The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature andvariety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may resultfrom large combinations concentrating more or less numerous enterprises andestablishments, which previously to the formation of the combination werecarried on separately.It is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control themarket of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to thegeneral community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition, wherebyprices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not onlyto the common law but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedyfor the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can beextended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, itshould be done without delay. Whatever power the Congress possesses overthis most important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted.President Harrison in his annual message of December 3, 1889, says: Earnestattention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the questionhow far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called"trusts" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they oftenare, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the productionor sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they are dangerousconspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject ofprohibitory and even penal legislation. An act to protect trade andcommerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by Congresson the 2d of July, 1890. The provisions of this statute are comprehensiveand stringent. It declares every contract or combination, in the form of atrust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the restraint of trade or commerceamong the several States or with foreign nations, to be unlawful. Itdenominates as a criminal every person who makes any such contract orengages in any such combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment byfine or imprisonment. It invests the several circuit courts of the UnitedStates with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of the act, andmakes it the duty of the several United States district attorneys, underthe direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equityto prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon any personwho shall be injured in his business or property by any other person orcorporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful bythe act, the power to sue therefore in any circuit court of the UnitedStates without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recoverthreefold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, includingreasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the act is aimed atevery kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly in restraintof interstate or international commerce.The prosecution by the United States of offenses under the act of 1890 hasbeen frequently resorted to in the Federal courts, and notable efforts inthe restraint of interstate commerce, such as the Trans Missouri FreightAssociation and the joint Traffic Association, have been successfullyopposed and suppressed.President Cleveland in his annual message of December 7, 1896 more thansix years subsequent to the enactment of this law after stating theevils of these trust combinations, says: Though Congress has attempted todeal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thusfar have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition orattempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves asinterpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If theinsufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation, itshould be done. The fact must be recognized, however, that all Federallegislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because ofinherent obstacles, and also because of the complex character of ourgovernmental system, which, while making the Federal authority supremewithin its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and boundswhich cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on thisprecise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts andmonopolies may be adequately treated through Federal action, unless theyseek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation orintercourse between States or between the United States and foreigncountries. It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of theremedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federalauthority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be nodoubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in thepremises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness tojudiciously exercise such power. The State legislation to which PresidentCleveland looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed toaccomplish fully that object. This is probably due to a great extent to thefact that different States take different views as to the proper way todiscriminate between evil and injurious combinations and those associationswhich are beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of thecountry. The great diversity of treatment in different States arising fromthis cause and the intimate relations of all parts of the country to eachother without regarding State lines in the conduct of business have madethe enforcement of State laws difficult.It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in theseveral States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that suchuniformity founded in a wise and just discrimination between what isinjurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may beobtained and that means may be found for the Congress within thelimitations of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective codeof State legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout theUnited States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rulesto which I have referred.The whole question is so important and far reaching that I am sure no partof it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have thestudied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judiciousaction.A review of our relations with foreign States is presented with suchrecommendations as are deemed appropriate.The long pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Chilewas settled in March last by the award of an arbitral commission, on whichthe United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire.Progress has been made toward the conclusion of a convention of extraditionwith the Argentine Republic. Having been advised and consented to by theUnited States Senate and ratified by Argentina, it only awaits theadjustment of some slight changes in the text before exchange.In my last annual message I adverted to the claim of the Austro HungarianGovernment for indemnity for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungariansubjects by the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania, at Lattimer,while suppressing an unlawful tumult of miners, September 10, 1897. In viewof the verdict of acquittal rendered by the court before which the sheriffand his deputies were tried for murder, and following the establisheddoctrine that the Government may not be held accountable for injuriessuffered by individuals at the hands of the public authorities while actingin the line of duty in suppressing disturbance of the public peace, thisGovernment, after due consideration of the claim advanced by theAustro Hungarian Government, was constrained to decline liability toindemnify the sufferers.It is gratifying to be able to announce that the Belgian Government hasmitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle from the UnitedStates, to which I referred in my last annual message.Having been invited by Belgium to participate in a congress, held atBrussels, to revise the provisions of the general act Of July 2, 1890, forthe repression of the African slave trade, to which the United States was asignatory party, this Government preferred not to be represented by aplenipotentiary, but reserved the right of accession to the result. Notablechanges were made, those especially concerning this country being in theline of the increased restriction of the deleterious trade in spirituousliquors with the native tribes, which this Government has from the outseturgently advocated. The amended general act will be laid before the Senate,with a view to its advice and consent.Early in the year the peace of Bolivia was disturbed by a successfulinsurrection. The United States minister remained at his post, attending tothe American interests in that quarter, and using besides his good officesfor the protection of the interests of British subjects in the absence oftheir national representative. On the establishment of the new Government,our minister was directed to enter into relations therewith.General Pando was elected President of Bolivia on October 23.Our representative has been instructed to use all permissible friendlyendeavors to induce the Government of Bolivia to amend its marriage laws soas to give legal status to the non Catholic and civil marriages of alienswithin its jurisdiction, and strong hopes are entertained that the Bolivianlaw in this regard will be brought, as was that of Peru some years ago,into harmony with the general practice of modern States.A convention of extradition with Brazil, signed May 14, 1897, has beenratified by the Brazilian Legislature.During the past summer two national ships of the United States have visitedBrazilian ports on a friendly mission and been cordially received. Thevoyage of the Wilmington up the Amazon River gave rise to a passingmisunderstanding, owing to confusion in obtaining permission to visit theinterior and make surveys in the general interest of navigation, but theincident found a ready adjustment in harmony with the close relations ofamity which this Government has always sedulously sought to cultivate withthe commonwealths of the Western Continent.The claim growing out of the seizure of the American owned newspaper "ThePanama Star and Herald" by the authorities of Colombia has been settled,after a controversy of several years, by an agreement assessing at $30,000the indemnity to be paid by the Colombian Government, in three installmentsof $10,000 each.The good will of Colombia toward our country has been testified anew by thecordial extension of facilities to the Nicaraguan Canal Commission in theirapproaching investigation of the Panama Canal and other projected routesacross the Isthmus of Darien.Toward the end of October an insurrectionary disturbance developed in theColombian Republic. This movement has thus far not attained any decisiveresult and is still in progress.Discussion of the questions raised by the action of Denmark in imposingrestrictions on the importation of American meats has continued withoutsubstantial result in our favor.The neighboring island Republic of Santo Domingo has lately been the sceneof revolution, following a long period of tranquility. It began with thekilling of President Heureaux in July last, and culminated in therelinquishment by the succeeding Vice President of the reins of governmentto the insurgents. The first act of the provisional government was thecalling of a presidential and constituent election. Juan Isidro Jimenez,having been elected President, was inaugurated on the 14th of November.Relations have been entered into with the newly established Government.The experimental association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador, tinderthe title of the Greater Republic of Central America, when apparently onthe threshold of a complete federal organization by the adoption of aconstitution and the formation of a national legislature, was disrupted inthe last days of November, 1898, by the withdrawal of Salvador. ThereuponNicaragua and Honduras abandoned the joint compact, each resuming itsformer independent sovereignty. This was followed by the reception ofMinister Merry by the Republics of Nicaragua and Salvador, while MinisterHunter in turn presented his credentials to the Government of Honduras,thus reverting to the old distribution of the diplomatic agencies of theUnited States in Central America for which our existing statutes provide. ANicaraguan envoy has been accredited to the United States.An insurrectionary movement, under General Reyes, broke out at Bluefieldsin February last, and for a time exercised actual control in the MosquitoTerritory. The Detroit was promptly sent thither for the protection ofAmerican interests. After a few weeks the Reyes government renounced theconflict, giving place to the restored supremacy of Nicaragua. During theinterregnum certain public dues accruing under Nicaraguan law werecollected from American merchants by the authorities for the time being ineffective administrative control. Upon the titular government regainingpower, a second payment of these dues was demanded. Controversy arosetouching the validity of the original payment of the debt to the de factoregent of the territory. An arrangement was effected in April last by theUnited States minister and the foreign secretary of Nicaragua whereby theamounts of the duplicate payments were deposited with the British consulpending an adjustment of the matter by direct agreement between theGovernments of the United States and Nicaragua. The controversy is stillunsettled.The contract of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua was declaredforfeited by the Nicaraguan Government on the Tenth of October, on theground of nonfulfillment within the ten years\' term stipulated in thecontract. The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against thisaction, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy ofconsideration. This Government expects that Nicaragua will afford theprotestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case.The Nicaragua Canal Commission, which had been engaged upon the work ofexamination and survey for a ship canal route across Nicaragua, havingcompleted its labors and made its report, was dissolved on May P, and onJune To a new commission, known as the Isthmian Canal Commission, wasorganized under the terms of the act approved March 3, 1899, for thepurpose of examining the American Isthmus with a view to determining themost practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that Isthmus,with its probable cost, and other essential details.This Commission, under the presidency of Rear Admiral John G. Walker, U. S.N. (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to it, and is nowcarrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of the Panama Canal,and in Darien from the Atlantic, in the neighborhood of the Atrato River,to the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good progress has been made, butunder the law a comprehensive and complete investigation is called for,which will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment.The work will be prosecuted as expeditiously as possible and a report madeat the earliest practicable date.The great importance of this work cannot be too often or too stronglypressed upon the attention of the Congress. In my message of a year ago Iexpressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the twogreat oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The reasons thenpresented for early action are even stronger now.A pleasing incident in the relations of this Government with that of Chileoccurred in the generous assistance given to the war ship Newark when indistress in Chilean waters. Not alone in this way has the friendlydisposition of Chile found expression. That country has acceded to theconvention for the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics,in which organization every independent State of the continent now shares.The exchange of ratifications of a convention for the revival of the UnitedStates and Chilean Claims Commission and for the adjudication of claimsheretofore presented but not determined during the life of the previousCommission has been delayed by reason of the necessity for fresh action bythe Chilean Senate upon the amendments attached to the ratification of thetreaty by the United States Senate. This formality is soon to beaccomplished.In view of disturbances in the populous provinces of northern China, whereare many of our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder near the capitaland toward the seaboard, a guard of marines was landed from the Boston andstationed during last winter in the legation compound at Peking. With therestoration of order this protection was withdrawn.The interests of our citizens in that vast Empire have not been neglectedduring the past year. Adequate protection has been secured for ourmissionaries and some injuries to their property have been redressed.American capital has sought and found various opportunities of competing tocarry out the internal improvements which the Imperial Government is wiselyencouraging, and to develop the natural resources of the Empire. Our tradewith China has continued to grow, and our commercial rights under existingtreaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year, as they willbe in the future.The extension of the area open to international foreign settlement atShanghai and the opening of the ports of Nanking, Tsing tao (Kiao chao),and Ta lien wan to foreign trade and settlement will doubtless affordAmerican enterprise additional facilities and new fields, of which it willnot be slow to take advantage.In my message to Congress of December 5, 1898, I urged that therecommendation which had been made to the Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of June, 1898,for an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial andindustrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to theopportunities for, and obstacles to, the enlargement of markets in Chinafor the raw products and manufactures of the United States, should receiveat your hands the consideration which its importance and timelinessmerited, but the Congress failed to take action.I now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject hassteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should belost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field forAmerican trade and enterprise.The death of President Faure in February last called forth those sincereexpressions of sympathy which befit the relations of two Republics asclosely allied by unbroken historic ties as are the United States andFrance.Preparations for the representation of the industries, arts, and productsof the United States at the World\'s Exposition to be held in Paris nextyear continue on an elaborate and comprehensive scale, thanks to thegenerous appropriation provided by Congress and to the friendly interestthe French Government has shown in furthering a typical exhibit of Americanprogress.There has been allotted to the United States a considerable addition ofspace, which, while placing our country in the first rant among exhibitors,does not suffice to meet the increasingly urgent demands of ourmanufacturers. The efforts of the Commissioner General are ably directedtoward a strictly representative display of all that mostcharacteristically marks American achievement in the inventive arts, andmost adequately shows the excellence of our natural productions.In this age of keen rivalry among nations for mastery in commerce, thedoctrine of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fittest must beas inexorable in their operation as they are positive in the results theybring about. The place won in the struggle by an industrial people can onlybe held by unrelaxed endeavor and constant advance in achievement. Thepresent extraordinary impetus in every line of American exportation and theastounding increase in the volume and value of our share in the world\'smarkets may not be attributed to accidental conditions.The reasons are not far to seek. They lie deep in our national characterand find expression year by year in every branch of handicraft, in everynew device whereby the materials we so abundantly produce are subdued tothe artisan\'s will and made to yield the largest, most practical, and mostbeneficial return. The American exhibit at Paris should, and I am confidentwill, be an open volume, whose lessons of skillfully directed endeavor,unfaltering energy, and consummate performance may be read by all on everypage, thus spreading abroad a clearer knowledge of the worth of ourproductions and the justice of our claim to an important place in the martsof the world. To accomplish this by judicious selection, by recognition ofparamount merit in whatever walk of trade or manufacture it may appear, andby orderly classification and attractive installation is the task of ourCommission.The United States Government building is approaching completion, and noeffort will be spared to make it worthy, in beauty of architectural planand in completeness of display, to represent our nation. It has beensuggested that a permanent building of similar or appropriate design beerected on a convenient site, already given by the municipality, near theexposition grounds, to serve in commemoration of the part taken by thiscountry in this great enterprise, as an American National Institute, forour countrymen resorting to Paris for study.I am informed by our Commissioner General that we shall have in theAmerican sections at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors, from every State ill ourcountry, a number ten times as great as those which were represented atVienna in 1873, six times as many as those in Paris in 1878, and four timesas many as those who exhibited in Paris in 1889. This statement does notinclude the exhibits from either Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii, for whicharrangements have been made.A number of important international congresses on special topics affectingpublic interests are proposed to be held in Paris next summer in connectionwith the exposition. Effort will be made to have the several technicalbranches of our administration efficiently represented at thoseconferences, each in its special line, and to procure the largest possibleconcourse of State representatives, particularly at the Congresses ofPublic Charity and Medicine.Our relations with Germany continue to be most cordial. The increasingintimacy of direct association has been marked during the year by thegranting permission in April for the landing on our shores of a cable fromBorkum Emden, on the North Sea, by way of the Azores, and also by theconclusion on September 2 of a Parcels Post Convention with the GermanEmpire. In all that promises closer relations of intercourse and commerceand a better understanding between two races having so many traits incommon, Germany can be assured of the most cordial cooperation of thisGovernment and people. We may be rivals in many material paths, but ourrivalry should be generous and open, ever aiming toward the attainment oflarger results and the mutually beneficial advancement of each in the lineof its especial adaptabilities.The several governments of the Empire seem reluctant to admit the naturalexcellence of our food productions and to accept the evidence we constantlytender of the care with which their purity is guarded by rigid inspectionfrom the farm, through the slaughterhouse and the packing establishments,to the port of shipment. Our system of control over exported food staplesinvites examination from any quarter and challenges respect by itsefficient thoroughness.It is to be hoped that in time the two Governments will act in commonaccord toward the realization of their common purpose to safeguard thepublic health and to insure the purity and wholesomeness of all foodproducts imported by either country from the other. Were the Congress toauthorize an invitation to Germany, in connection with the pendingreciprocity negotiations, for the constitution of a joint commission ofscientific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct a searchinginvestigation of food production and exportation in both countries andreport to their respective legislatures for the adoption of such remedialmeasures as they might recommend for either, the way might be opened forthe desirable result indicated.Efforts to obtain for American life insurance companies a full hearing asto their business operations in Prussia have, after several years ofpatient representation, happily succeeded, and one of the most importantAmerican companies has been granted a concession to continue business inthat Kingdom.I am also glad to announce that the German insurance companies have beenreadmitted by the superintendent of insurance to do business in the Stateof New York.Subsequent to the exchange of our peace treaty with Spain, Germany acquiredthe Caroline Islands by purchase, paying therefore $5,000,000. Assuranceshave been received from the German Government that the rights of Americanmissionaries and traders there will be considerately observed.In my last annual message I referred to the pending negotiations with GreatBritain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an executiveagreement, a joint High Commission had been created for the purpose ofadjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and Canada,embracing twelve subjects, among which were the questions of the fur seals,the fisheries of the coast and contiguous inland waters, the Alaskanboundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien labor laws, miningrights, reciprocity in trade, revision of the agreement respecting navalvessels in the Great Lakes, a more complete marking of parts of theboundary, provision for the conveyance of criminals, and for wrecking andsalvage.Much progress had been made by the Commission toward the adjustment of manyof these questions, when it became apparent that an irreconcilabledifference of views was entertained respecting the delimitation of theAlaskan, boundary. In the failure of an agreement as to the meaning ofArticles III and IV of the treaty of 1825 between Russia and Great Britain,which defined the boundary between Alaska and Canada, the AmericanCommissioners proposed that the subject of the boundary be laid aside, andthat the remaining questions of difference be proceeded with, some of whichwere so far advanced as to assure the probability of a settlement. Thisbeing declined by the British Commissioners, an adjournment was taken untilthe boundary should be adjusted by the two Governments. The subject hasbeen receiving the careful attention which its importance demands, with theresult that a modus vivendi for provisional demarcations in the regionabout the head of Lynn Canal has, been agreed upon; and it is hoped thatthe negotiations now in progress between the two Governments will end in anagreement for the establishment and delimitation of a permanent boundary.Apart from these questions growing out of our relationship with ournorthern neighbor, the most friendly disposition and ready agreement havemarked the discussion of numerous matters arising in the vast and intimateintercourse of the United States with Great Britain.This Government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfortunatecontest between Great Britain and the Boer States of Africa. We haveremained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliances as toaffairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that theparties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression of thehope of the American people that war might be averted, good offices wouldhave been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria wasearly instructed to see that all neutral American interests be respected bythe combatants. This has been an easy task in view of the positivedeclarations of both British and Boer authorities that the personal andproperty rights of our citizens should be observed.Upon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United Statesconsul was authorized, upon the request of the British Government and withthe assent of the South African and Orange Free State Governments, toexercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of Britishinterests. In the discharge of this function, I am happy to say thatabundant opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of thisGovernment toward both the combatants.For the fourth time in the present decade, question has arisen with theGovernment of Italy in regard to the lynching of Italian subjects. Thelatest of these deplorable events occurred at Tallulah, Louisiana, wherebyfive unfortunates of Italian origin were taken from jail and hanged.The authorities of the State and a representative of the Italian Embassyhaving separately investigated the occurrence, with discrepant results,particularly as to the alleged citizenship of the victims, and it notappearing that the State had been able to discover and punish the violatorsof the law, an independent investigation has been set on foot, through theagency of the Department of State, and is still in progress. The resultwill enable the Executive to treat the question with the Government ofItaly in a spirit of fairness and justice. A satisfactory solution willdoubtless be reached.The recurrence of these distressing manifestations of blind mob furydirected at dependents or natives of a foreign country suggests that thecontingency has arisen for action by Congress in the direction ofconferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class ofinternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the FederalGovernment may be involved. The suggestion is not new. In his annualmessage of December 9, 1891, my predecessor, President Harrison, said: Itwould, I believe, be entirely competent for Congress to make offensesagainst the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United Statescognizable in the Federal courts. This has not, however, been done, and theFederal officers and courts have no power in such cases to intervene eitherfor the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of hisslayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state of the law, that theofficers of the State charged with police and judicial powers in such casesmust, in the consideration of international questions growing out of suchincidents, be regarded in such sense as Federal agents as to make thisGovernment answerable for their acts in cases where it would be answerableif the United States had used its constitutional power to define and punishcrimes against treaty rights. A bill to provide for the punishment ofviolations of treaty rights of aliens was introduced in the Senate March 1,1892, and reported favorably March 30. Having doubtless in view thelanguage of that part of Article III of the treaty of February 26, 1871,between the United States and Italy, which stipulates that "The citizensof each of the high contracting parties shall receive, in the States andTerritories of the other, most constant protection and security for theirpersons and property, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights andprivileges as are or shall be granted to the natives, on their submittingthemselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives," the bill sointroduced and reported provided that any act committed in any State orTerritory of the United States in violation of the rights of a citizen orsubject of a foreign country secured to such citizen or subject by treatybetween the United States and such foreign country and constituting a crimeunder the laws of the State or Territory shall constitute a like crimeagainst the United States and be cognizable in the Federal courts. Noaction was taken by Congress in the matter.I earnestly recommend that the subject be taken up anew and acted uponduring the present session. The necessity for some such provisionabundantly appears. Precedent for constituting a Federal jurisdiction incriminal cases where aliens are sufferers is rationally deducible from theexisting statute, which gives to the district and circuit courts of theUnited States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by aliens where theamount involved exceeds a certain sum. If such jealous solicitude be shownfor alien rights in cases of merely civil and pecuniary import, how muchgreater should be the public duty to take cognizance of matters affectingthe lives and the rights of aliens tinder the settled principles ofinternational law no less than under treaty stipulation, in cases of suchtranscendent wrong doing as mob murder, especially when experience hasshown that local justice is too often helpless to punish the offenders.After many years of endeavor on the part of this Government to that end theItalian Government has consented to enter into negotiations for anaturalization convention, having for one of its objects the regulation ofthe status of Italians (except those of an age for active military service)who, having been naturalized in the United States, may revisit Italy. It ishoped that with the mutually conciliatory spirit displayed a successfulconclusion will be reached.The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japanon November 22, 1894, took effect in accordance with the terms of its XIXthArticle on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with the enforcement oflike treaties with the other powers, except France, whose convention didnot go into operation until August 4, the United States being, however,granted up to that date all the privileges and rights accorded to Frenchcitizens under the old French treaty. By this notable conventional reformJapan\'s position as a fully independent sovereign power is assured, controlbeing gained of taxation, customs revenues, judicial administration,coasting trade, and all other domestic functions of government, and foreignextra territorial rights being renounced.Comprehensive codes of civil and criminal procedure according to westernmethods, public instruction, patents and copyrights, municipaladministration, including jurisdiction over the former foreign settlements,customs tariffs and procedure, public health, and other administrativemeasures have been proclaimed. The working of the new system has given riseto no material complaints on the part of the American citizens orinterests, a circumstance which attests the ripe consideration with whichthe change has been prepared.Valuable assistance was rendered by the Japanese authorities to the UnitedStates transport ship Morgan City while stranded at Kobe. Permission hasbeen granted to land and pasture army horses at Japanese ports of call onthe way to the Philippine Islands. These kindly evidences of good will arehighly appreciated.The Japanese Government has shown a lively interest in the proposition ofthe Pacific Cable Company to add to its projected cable lines to Hawaii,Guam, and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan. Itwould be a gratifying consummation were the utility of the contemplatedscheme enhanced by bringing Japan and the United States into directtelegraphic relation.Without repeating the observations of my special message of February 10,1899, concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila. I respectfully inviteattention to it.I recommend that, in case the Congress should not take measures to bringabout this result by direct action of the Government, the PostmasterGeneral be authorized to invite competitive bids for the establishment of acable; the company making the best responsible bid to be awarded thecontract; the successful company to give ample bonds to insure thecompletion of the work within a reasonable time.The year has been marked by constant increase in the intimacy of ourrelations with Mexico and in the magnitude of mutually advantageousinterchanges. This Government has omitted no opportunity to show its strongdesire to develop and perpetuate the ties of cordiality now so long happilyunbroken.Following the termination on January 20, 1899, by Mexico of the conventionof extradition of December 11, 1861, a new treaty more in accordance withthe ascertained needs of both countries was signed February 22, 1899, andexchanged in the City of Mexico on the 22d of April last. Its operationthus far has been effective and satisfactory. A recent case has served totest the application of its IVth Article, which provides that neither partyshall be bound to deliver up its own citizens, but that the executiveauthority of each shall have the power to deliver them up if in itsdiscretion it be deemed proper to do so.The extradition of Mrs. Mattie Rich, a citizen of the United States,charged with homicide committed in Mexico, was after mature considerationdirected by me in the conviction that the ends of justice would be therebysubserved. Similar action, on appropriate occasion, by the MexicanExecutive will not only tend to accomplish the desire of both Governmentsthat grave crimes go not unpunished, but also to repress lawlessness alongthe border of the two countries. The new treaty stipulates that neitherGovernment shall assume jurisdiction in the punishment of crimes committedexclusively within the territory of the other. This will obviate in futurethe embarrassing controversies which have heretofore arisen throughMexico\'s assertion of a claim to try and punish an American citizen for anoffense committed within the jurisdiction of the United States.The International Water Boundary Commission, organized by the convention ofMarch 1, 1889, for the adjustment of questions affecting the Rio Grandefrontier, has not yet completed its labors. A further extension of its termfor one year, until December 24, 1899, was effected by a convention signedDecember z, 1898, and exchanged and proclaimed in February last.An invitation extended to the President of Mexico to visit Chicago inOctober, on the occasion of laying the corner stone of the United StatesGovernment building in that city, was cordially accepted by him, with thenecessary consent of the Mexican Congress, but the illness of a member ofhis family prevented his attendance. The Minister of Foreign Relations,however, came as the personal representative of President Diaz, and in thathigh character was duly honored.Claims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering Seahave been under discussion with the Government of Russia for several years,with the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decisionof a single arbitrator. By this act Russia affords proof of her adherenceto the beneficent principle of arbitration which her plenipotentiariesconspicuously favored at The Hague Disarmament Conference when it wasadvocated by the representatives of the United States.A suggestion for a permanent exposition of our products and manufactures inRussia, although not yet fully shaped, has been so cordially welcomed bythe Imperial Government that it may not inaptly take a fitting place inwhatever legislation the Congress may adopt looking to enlargement of ourcommercial opportunities abroad.Important events have occurred in the Samoan Islands. The election,according to the laws and customs of Samoa, of a successor to the lateKing, Malietoa Laupepa, developed a contest as to the validity of theresult, which issue, by the terms of the General Act, was to be decided bythe Chief justice. Upon his rendering a judgment in favor of Malietoa Tanu,the rival chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The active intervention of Americanand British war ships became imperative to restore order, at the cost ofsanguinary encounters. In this emergency a joint commission ofrepresentatives of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain was sentto Samoa to investigate the situation and provide a temporary remedy. Byits active efforts a peaceful solution was reached for the time being, thekingship being abolished and a provisional government established.Recommendations unanimously made by the commission for a permanentadjustment of the Samoan question were taken under consideration by thethree powers parties to the General Act. But the more they were examinedthe more evident it became that a radical change was necessary in therelations of the powers to Samoa.The inconveniences and possible perils of the tripartite scheme ofsupervision and control in the Samoan group by powers having littleinterest in common in that quarter beyond commercial rivalry had been oncemore emphasized by the recent events. The suggested remedy of the jointCommission, like the scheme it aimed to replace amounted to what has beenstyled a tridominium, being the exercise of the functions of sovereignty byan unanimous agreement of three powers. The situation had become far moreintricate and embarrassing from every point of view than it was when mypredecessor, in 1894, summed up its perplexities and condemned theparticipation in it of the United States.The arrangement under which Samoa was administered had proved impracticableand unacceptable to all the powers concerned. To withdraw from theagreement and abandon the islands to Germany and Great Britain would not becompatible with our interests in the archipelago. To relinquish our rightsin the harbor of Pago Pago, the best anchorage in the Pacific, theoccupancy of which had been leased to the United States in 1878 by thefirst foreign treaty ever concluded by Samoa, was not to be thought ofeither as regards the needs of our Navy or the interests of our growingcommerce with the East. We could not have considered any proposition forthe abrogation of the tripartite control which did not confirm us in allour rights and safeguard all our national interests in the islands.Our views commended themselves to the other powers. A satisfactoryarrangement was concluded between the Governments of Germany and ofEngland, by virtue of which England retired from Samoa in view ofcompensations in other directions, and both powers renounced in favor ofthe United States all their rights and claims over and in respect to thatportion of the group lying to the east of the one hundred and seventy firstdegree of west longitude, embracing the islands of Tutuila, Ofoo, Olosenga,and Manua. I transmit to the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,a convention, which besides the provisions above mentioned also guaranteesus the same privileges and conditions in respect to commerce and commercialvessels in all of the islands of Samoa as those possessed by Germany.Claims have been preferred by white residents of Samoa on account ofinjuries alleged to have been suffered through the acts of the treatyGovernments in putting down the late disturbances. A convention has beenmade between the three powers for the investigation and settlement of theseclaims by a neutral arbitrator, to which the attention of the Senate willbe invited.My annual message of last year was necessarily devoted, in great part to aconsideration of the Spanish War and of the results it wrought and theconditions it imposed for the future. I am gratified to announce that thetreaty of peace has restored friendly relations between the two powers.Effect has been given to its most important provisions. The evacuation ofPuerto Rico having already been accomplished on the XIVth of October, 1898,nothing remained necessary there but to continue the provisional militarycontrol of the island until the Congress should enact a suitable governmentfor the ceded territory. Of the character and scope of the measures to thatend I shall treat in another part of this message.The withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba waseffected by the 1st of January, so that the full re establishment of peacefound the relinquished territory held by us in trust for the inhabitants,maintaining, under the direction of the Executive, such government andcontrol therein as should conserve public order, restore the productiveconditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability and disorder whichprevailed for the greater part of the preceding three decades, and build upthat tranquil development of the domestic state whereby alone can berealized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted bythe Congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by which the United Statesdisclaimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty,jurisdiction, or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof,and asserted its determination when that was accomplished to leave thegovernment and control of the island to its people. The pledge contained inthis resolution is of the highest honorable obligation and must be sacredlykept.I believe that substantial progress has been made in this direction. Allthe administrative measures adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for aregenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy of law and justice; byplacing wherever practicable the machinery of administration in the handsof the inhabitants; by instituting needed sanitary reforms; by spreadingeducation; by fostering industry and trade; by inculcating public morality,and, in short, by taking every rational step to aid the Cuban people toattain to that plane of self conscious respect and self reliant unity whichfits an enlightened community for self government within its own sphere,while enabling it to fulfill all outward obligation.This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for thefuture good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust the fulfillment ofwhich calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of thehighest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past mustneeds be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if itsenduring welfare is to be assured. Whether those ties shall be organic orconventional, the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful form and mannerirrevocably linked with our own, but how and how far is for the future todetermine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be the outcome, we must seeto it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity, not ahasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure. Ourmission, to accomplish which we took up the wager of battle, is not to befulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face thevicissitudes which too often attend weaker States whose natural wealth andabundant resources are offset by the incongruities of their politicalorganization and the recurring occasions for internal rivalries to saptheir strength and dissipate their energies. The greatest blessing whichcan come to Cuba is the restoration of her agricultural and industrialprosperity, which will give employment to idle men and re establish thepursuits of peace. This is her chief and immediate need.On the 19th of August last an order was made for the taking of the censusin the island, to be completed on the 30th of November. By the treaty ofpeace the Spanish people on the island have until April 11, 1900, to electwhether they will remain citizens of Spain or become citizens of Cuba.Until then it cannot be definitely ascertained who shall be entitled toparticipate in the formation of the government of Cuba. By that time theresults of the census will have been tabulated and we shall proceed toprovide for elections which will commit the municipal governments of theisland to the officers elected by the people. The experience thus acquiredwill prove of great value in the formation of a representative conventionof the people to draft a constitution and establish a general system ofindependent government for the island. In the meantime and so long as weexercise control over the island the products of Cuba should have a marketin the United States on as good terms and with as favorable rates of dutyas are given to the West India Islands under treaties of reciprocity whichshall be made.For the relief of the distressed in the island of Cuba the War Departmenthas issued supplies to destitute persons through the officers of the Army,which have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a cost Of $1,417,554.07.To promote the disarmament of the Cuban volunteer army, and in the interestof public peace and the welfare of the people, the sum Of $75 was paid toeach Cuban soldier borne upon the authenticated rolls, on condition that heshould deposit his arms with the authorities designated by the UnitedStates. The sum thus disbursed aggregated $2,547,750, which was paid fromthe emergency fund provided by the act of January 5, 1899, for thatpurpose.Out of the Cuban island revenues during the six months ending June 30,1899, $1,712,014.20 was expended for sanitation, $293,881.70 for charitiesand hospitals, and $88,944.03 for aid to the destitute.Following the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace the twoGovernments accredited ministers to each other, Spain sending to Washingtonthe Duke of Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, previously stationed in Mexico,while the United States transferred to Madrid Hon. Bellamy Storer, itsminister at Brussels. This was followed by the respective appointment ofconsuls, thereby fully resuming the relations interrupted by the war. Inaddition to its consular representation in the United States, the SpanishGovernment has appointed consuls for Cuba, who have been provisionallyrecognized during the military administration of the affairs of thatisland.Judicial intercourse between the courts of Cuba and Puerto Rico and ofSpain has been established, as provided by the treaty of peace. The Cubanpolitical prisoners in Spanish penal stations have been and are beingreleased and returned to their homes, in accordance with Article VI of thetreaty. Negotiations are about to be had for defining the conventionalrelations between the two countries, which fell into abeyance by reason ofthe war. I trust that these will include a favorable arrangement forcommercial reciprocity under the terms of sections 3 and 4 of the currenttariff act. In these, as in all matters of international concern, no effortwill be spared to respond to the good disposition of Spain, and tocultivate in all practicable ways the intimacy which should prevail betweentwo nations whose past history has so often and in so many ways been markedby sincere friendship and by community of interests.I would recommend appropriate legislation in order to carry into executionArticle VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the United Statesassured the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens againstSpain.The United States minister to Turkey continues, under instructions, topress for a money payment in satisfaction of the just claims for injuriessuffered by American citizens in the disorders of several years past andfor wrongs done to them by the Ottoman authorities. Some of these claimsare of many years\' standing. This Government is hopeful of a generalagreement in this regard.In the Turkish Empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory.Our efforts during nearly forty years to bring about a convention ofnaturalization seem to be on the brink of final failure through theannounced policy of the Ottoman Porte to refuse recognition of the alienstatus of native Turkish subjects naturalized abroad since 1867. Ourstatutes do not allow this Government to admit any distinction between thetreatment of native and naturalized Americans abroad, so that ceaselesscontroversy arises in cases where persons owing in the eye of internationallaw a dual allegiance are prevented from entering Turkey or are expelledafter entrance. Our law in this regard contrasts with that of the EuropeanStates. The British act, for instance, does not claim effect for thenaturalization of an alien in the event of his return to his nativecountry, unless the change be recognized by the law of that country orstipulated by treaty between it and the naturalizing State.The arbitrary treatment, in some instances, of American productions inTurkey has attracted attention of late, notably in regard to our flour.Large shipments by the recently opened direct steamship line to Turkishports have been denied entrance on the score that, although of standardcomposition and unquestioned purity, the flour was pernicious to healthbecause of deficient "elasticity" as indicated by antiquated anduntrustworthy tests. Upon due protest by the American minister, and itappearing that the act was a virtual discrimination against our product,the shipments in question were admitted. In these, as in all instances,wherever occurring, when American products may be subjected in a foreigncountry, upon specious pretexts, to discrimination compared with the likeproducts of another country, this Government will use its earnest effortsto secure fair and equal treatment for its citizens and their goods.Failing this, it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective may beprovided by the statutes.The International Commission of Arbitration, appointed under theAnglo Venezuelan treaty of 1897, rendered an award on October 3 last,whereby the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana isdetermined, thus ending a controversy which has existed for the greaterpart of the century. The award, as to which the arbitrators were unanimous,while not meeting the extreme contention of either party, gives to GreatBritain a large share of the interior territory in dispute and to Venezuelathe entire mouth of the Orinoco, including Barima Point and the Caribbeanlittoral for some distance to the eastward. The decision appears to beequally satisfactory to both parties.Venezuela has once more undergone a revolution. The insurgents, underGeneral Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in which they suffered muchloss, rallied in the mountainous interior and advanced toward the capital.The bulk of the army having sided with the movement, President Andradequitted Caracas, where General Castro set up a provisional government withwhich our minister and the representatives of other powers entered intodiplomatic relations on the 20th of November, 1899.The fourth section of the Tariff Act approved July 24, 1897, appears toprovide only for commercial treaties which should be entered into by thePresident and also ratified by the Senate within two years from itspassage. Owing to delays inevitable in negotiations of this nature, none ofthe treaties initiated under that section could be concluded in time forratification by the Senate prior to its adjournment on the 4th of Marchlast. Some of the pending negotiations, however, were near conclusion atthat time, and the resulting conventions have since been signed by theplenipotentiaries. Others, within both the third and fourth sections of theact, are still under consideration. Acting under the constitutional powerof the Executive in respect to treaties, I have deemed it my duty, whileobserving the limitations of concession provided by the fourth section, tobring to a conclusion all pending negotiations, and submit them to theSenate for its advice and consent.Conventions of reciprocity have been signed during the Congressional recesswith Great Britain for the respective colonies of British Guiana, Barbados,Bermuda, Jamaica, and Turks and Caicos Islands, and with the Republic ofNicaragua.Important reciprocal conventions have also been concluded with France andwith the Argentine Republic.In my last annual message the progress noted in the work of the diplomaticand consular officers in collecting information as to the industries andcommerce of other countries, and in the care and promptitude with whichtheir reports are printed and distributed, has continued during the pastyear, with increasingly valuable results in suggesting new sources ofdemand for American products and in pointing out the obstacles still to beovercome in facilitating the remarkable expansion of our foreign trade. Itwill doubtless be gratifying to Congress to learn that the various agenciesof the Department of State are co operating in these endeavors with a zealand effectiveness which are not only receiving the cordial recognition ofour business interests, but are exciting the emulation of otherGovernments. In any rearrangement of the great and complicated work ofobtaining official data of an economic character which Congress mayundertake it is most important, in my judgment, that the results alreadysecured by the efforts of the Department of State should be carefullyconsidered with a view to a judicious development and increased utility toour export trade.The interest taken by the various States forming the International Union ofAmerican Republics in the work of its organic bureau is evidenced by thefact that for the first time since its creation in 1890 all the Republicsof South and Central America are now represented in it.The unanimous recommendation of the International American Conference,providing for the International Union of American Republics, stated that itshould continue in force during a term of ten years from the date of itsorganization, and no country becoming a member of the union should cease tobe a member until the end of said period of ten years, and unless twelvemonths before the expiration of said period a majority of the members ofthe union had given to the Secretary of State of the United States officialnotice of their wish to terminate the union at the end of its first period,that the union should continue to be maintained for another period of tenyears, and thereafter, under the same conditions, for successive periods often years each.The period for notification expired on July 14, 1899, without any of themembers having given the necessary notice of withdrawal. Its maintenance istherefore assured for the next ten years. In view of this fact and of thenumerous questions of general interest and common benefit to all of theRepublics of America, some of which were considered by the firstInternational American Conference, but not finally settled, and otherswhich have since then grown to importance, it would seem expedient that thevarious Republics constituting the Union should be invited to hold at anearly date another conference in the capital of one of the countries otherthan the United States, which has already enjoyed this honor.The purely international character of the work being done by the bureau andthe appreciation of its value are further emphasized by the activeco operation which the various Governments of the Latin. American Republicsand their diplomatic representatives in this capital are now exhibiting andthe zealous endeavors they are making to extend its field of usefulness, topromote through it commercial intercourse, and strengthen the bonds ofamity and confidence between its various members and the nations of thiscontinent.The act to encourage the holding of the Pan American Exposition on theNiagara frontier, within the county of Erie or Niagara, in the State of NewYork, in the year 1901, was approved on March 3, 1899.This exposition, which will be held in the city of Buffalo, in the nearvicinity of the great Niagara cataract, and within a day\'s journey of whichreside 40, 000, 000 Of our people, will be confined entirely to the WesternHemisphere. Satisfactory assurances have already been given by thediplomatic representatives of Great Britain, Mexico, the Central and SouthAmerican Republics, and most of the States of the United States that thesecountries and States will make an unique, interesting, and instructiveexhibit, peculiarly illustrative of their material progress during thecentury which is about to close.The law provides an appropriation Of $500,000 for the purpose of making anexhibit at the exposition by the Government of the United States from itsExecutive Departments and from the Smithsonian Institution and NationalMuseum, the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, the Departmentof Labor, and the Bureau of the American Republics. To secure a completeand harmonious arrangement of this Government exhibit a board of managementhas already been created, and charged with the selection, purchase,preparation, transportation, arrangement, and safe keeping of the articlesand materials to be exhibited. This board has been organized and hasalready entered upon the performance of its duties, as provided for by thelaw.I have every reason to hope and believe that this exposition will tend morefirmly to cement the cordial relations between the nations on thiscontinent.In accordance with an act of Congress approved December 21, 1898, and underthe auspices of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, a most interesting andvaluable exposition of products and manufactures especially adapted toexport trade was held in Philadelphia from the 14th of September to the 1stof December, 1899. The representative character of the exhibits and thewidespread interest manifested in the special objects of the undertakingafford renewed encouragement to those who look confidently to the steadygrowth of our enlarged exportation of manufactured goods, which has beenthe most remarkable fact in the economic development of the United Statesin recent years. A feature of this exposition which is likely to become ofpermanent and increasing utility to our industries is the collection ofsamples of merchandise produced in various countries with special referenceto particular markets, providing practical object lessons to United Statesmanufacturers as to qualities, styles, and prices of goods such as meet thespecial demands of consumers and may be exported with advantage.In connection with the exposition an International Commercial Congress washeld, upon the invitation of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum,transmitted by the Department of State to the various foreign Governments,for an exchange of information and opinions with the view to the promotionof international trade. This invitation met with general and cordialacceptance, and the Congress, which began its sessions at the exposition onthe 13th of October proved to be of great practical importance, from thefact that it developed a general recognition of the interdependence ofnations in trade and a most gratifying spirit of accommodation withreference to the gradual removal of existing impediments to reciprocalrelations, without injury to the industrial interests of either party.In response to the invitation of His Majesty, the Emperor of Russia,delegates from twenty six countries were assembled at The Hague on the 18thof May, as members of a conference in the interest of peace. The commissionfrom the United States consisted of the Hon. Andrew D. White, the Hon. SethLow, the Hon. Stanford Newel, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, of the United StatesNavy, Captain William Crozier, of the United States Army, and the Hon.Frederick W. Holls, secretary. The occasion seemed to be opportune for theserious consideration of a plan for the pacific adjustment of internationaldifferences, a subject in which the American people have been deeplyinterested for many years, and a definite project for a permanentinternational tribunal was included in the instructions to the delegates ofthe United States.The final act of the conference includes conventions upon the ameliorationof the laws and customs of war on land, the adaptation to maritime warfareof the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1864, and the extension ofjudicial methods to international cases. The Convention for the PacificSettlement of International Conflicts embodies the leading features of theAmerican plan, with such modifications as were rendered necessary by thegreat diversity of views and interests represented by the delegates. Thefour titles of the convention provide for the maintenance of general peace,the exercise of good offices and mediation, the formation of commissions ofinquiry, and international arbitration.The mediation provided for by the convention is purely voluntary andadvisory, and is intended to avoid any invasion or limitation of thesovereign rights of the adhering States. The commissions of inquiryproposed consists of delegations to be specifically constituted forparticular purposes by means of conventions between the contesting parties,having for their object the clear understanding of internationaldifferences before resorting to the use of force. The provision forarbitration contemplates the formation of a permanent tribunal before whichdisputed cases may be brought for settlement by the mutual consent of thelitigants in each separate case. The advantages of such a permanenttribunal over impromptu commissions of arbitration are conceived to be theactual existence of a competent court, prepared to administer justice, thegreater economy resulting from a well devised system, and the accumulatedjudicial skill and experience which such a tribunal would soon possess.While earnestly promoting the idea of establishing a permanentinternational tribunal, the delegation of the United States was notunmindful of the inconveniences which might arise from an obtrusiveexercise of mediation, and in signing the convention carefully guarded thehistoric position of the United States by the following declaration:Nothing contained in this convention shall be so construed as to requirethe United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of notintruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the politicalquestions or policy or internal administration of any foreign state; norshall anything contained in the said convention be construed to imply arelinquishment by the United. States of America of its traditional attitudetoward purely American questions. Thus interpreted, the Convention for thePacific Settlement of International Conflicts may be regarded as realizingthe earnest desire of great numbers of American citizens, whose deep senseof justice, expressed in numerous resolutions and memorials, has urged themto labor for this noble achievement. The general character of thisconvention, already signed by the delegates of more than twenty sovereignStates, further commends it to the favorable action of the Senate of theUnited States, whose ratification it still awaits.Since my last annual message, and in obedience to the acts of the Congressof April 22 and 26, 1898, the remaining volunteer force enlisted for theSpanish War, consisting Of 34,834 regulars and 110,202 volunteers, withover 5,000 volunteer officers, has been discharged from the militaryservice. Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831 men were serving in thePhilippines, and 1,650 of the regulars, who were entitled to be musteredout after the ratification of the treaty of peace. They voluntarilyremained at the front until their places could be filled by new troops.They were returned home in the order in which they went to Manila, and arenow all of them out of the service and in the ranks of citizenship. Irecommend that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for thevolunteers, regulars, sailors, and marines on duty in the Philippines whovoluntarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment hadexpired.By the act of March 2, 1899, Congress gave authority to increase theRegular Army to a maximum not exceeding 65,000 enlisted men, and to enlista force of 5,000 volunteers, to be recruited from the country at large. Byvirtue of this authority the Regular Army has been increased to the numberof 61,999 enlisted men and 2,248 officers, and new volunteer regiments havebeen organized aggregating 33,050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers. Two ofthese volunteer regiments are made up of colored men, with colored lineofficers. The new troops to take the places of those returning from thePhilippines have been transported to Manila to the number of 581 officersand 26,322 enlisted men of the Regular Army and 594 officers and 15,388enlisted men of the new volunteer force, while 504 officers and 14, 119 menof the volunteer force are on the ocean en route to Manila.The force now in Manila consists Of 905 officers and 30,578 regulars, and594 officers and 15,388 of the volunteers, making an aggregate of 1,499officers and 45,966 men. When the troops now under orders shall reachManila the force in the archipelago will comprise 2,051 officers and 63,483men. The muster out of the great volunteer army organized for the SpanishWar and the creation of a new army, the transportation from Manila to SanFrancisco of those entitled to discharge and the transportation of the newtroops to take their places have been a work of great magnitude well andably done, for which too much credit cannot be given the War Department.During the past year we have reduced our force in Cuba and Puerto Rico, InCuba we now have 334 officers and 10,796 enlisted men; In Puerto Rico, 87officers and 2,855 enlisted men and a battalion of 400 men composed ofnative Puerto Ricans; while stationed throughout the United States are 910officers and 17,317 men, and in Hawaii 12 officers and 453 enlisted men.The operations of the Army are fully presented in the report of theSecretary of War. I cannot withhold from officers and men the highestcommendation for their soldierly conduct in trying situations, theirwilling sacrifices for their country, and the integrity and ability withwhich they have performed unusual and difficult duties in our islandpossessions.In the organization of the volunteer regiments authorized by the act ofMarch 2, 1899, it was found that no provision had been made for chaplains.This omission was doubtless from inadvertence. I recommend the earlyauthorization for the appointment of one chaplain for each of saidregiments. These regiments are now in the Philippines, and it is importantthat immediate action be had.In restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule, and civic progress in Cuba,Puerto Rico, and, so far as practicable, in the Philippines, therehabilitation of the postal service has been an essential and importantpart of the work. It became necessary to provide mail facilities both forour forces of occupation and for the native population. To meet thisrequirement has involved a substantial reconstruction. The existing systemswere so fragmentary, defective, and inadequate that a new and comprehensiveorganization had to be created. American trained officials have beenassigned to the directing and executive positions, while natives have beenchiefly employed in making up the body of the force. In working out thisplan the merit rule has been rigorously and faithfully applied.The appointment of Director General of Posts of Cuba was given to an expertwho had been Chief Post Office Inspector and Assistant Postmaster General,and who united large experience with administrative capacity. For thepostmastership at Havana the range of skilled and available men wasscanned, and the choice fell upon one who had been twenty years in theservice as deputy postmaster and postmaster of a large city. This principlegoverned and determined the selection of the American officials sent notonly to Cuba, but to Puerto Rico and the Philippines, and they wereinstructed to apply it so far as practicable in the employment of thenatives as minor postmasters and clerks. The postal system in Cuba, thoughremaining under the general guidance of the Postmaster General, was madeessentially independent. It was felt that it should not be a burden uponthe postal service of the United States, and provision was made that anydeficit in the postal revenue should be a charge upon the general revenuesof the island.Though Puerto Rico and the Philippines hold a different relation to theUnited States, yet, for convenience of administration, the same principleof an autonomous system has been extended to them. The development of theservice in all of the islands has been rapid and successful. It has movedforward on American lines, with free delivery, money order, and registrysystems, and has given the people mail facilities far greater and morereliable than any they have ever before enjoyed. It is thus not only avital agency of industrial, social, and business progress, but an importantinfluence in diffusing a just understanding of the true spirit andcharacter of American administration.The domestic postal service continues to grow with extraordinary rapidity.The expenditures and the revenues will each exceed $100,000,000 during thecurrent year. Fortunately, since the revival of prosperous times therevenues have grown much faster than the expenditures, and there is everyindication that a short period will witness the obliteration of the annualdeficit. In this connection the report of the Postmaster General embodies astatement of some evils which have grown up outside of the contemplation oflaw in the treatment of some classes of mail matter which wrongly exercisethe privilege of the pound rate, and shows that if this matter had beenproperly classified and had paid the rate which it should have paid,instead of a postal deficit for the last fiscal year of $6,610,000, therewould have been on one basis a surplus of $17,637,570, and on another Of$5,733,836. The reform thus suggested, in the opinion of thePostmaster General, would not only put the postal service at once on aself sustaining basis, but would permit great and valuable improvements,and I commend the subject to the consideration of the Congress.The Navy has maintained the spirit and high efficiency which have alwayscharacterized that service, and has lost none of the gallantry in heroicaction which has signalized its brilliant and glorious past. The Nation hasequal pride in its early and later achievements. Its habitual readiness forevery emergency has won the confidence and admiration of the country. Thepeople are interested in the continued preparation and prestige of the Navyand will justify liberal appropriations for its maintenance andimprovement. The officers have shown peculiar adaptation for theperformance of new and delicate duties which our recent war has imposed.It cannot be doubted that Congress will at once make necessary provisionfor the armor plate for the vessels now under contract and building. Itsattention is respectfully called to the report of the Secretary of theNavy, in which the subject is fully presented. I unite in hisrecommendation that the Congress enact such special legislation as may benecessary to enable the Department to make contracts early in the comingyear for armor of the best quality that can be obtained in this country forthe Maine, Ohio, and Missouri, and that the provision of the act of March3, 1899, limiting the price of armor to $300 per ton be removed.In the matter of naval construction Italy and Japan, of the great powers,laid down less tonnage in the year 1899 than this country, and Italy alonehas less tonnage under construction. I heartily concur in therecommendations for the increase of the Navy, as suggested by theSecretary.Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability to equal, if notsurpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science, industry,and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful aids tothe accomplishment of such a result. The attention of the Congress isdirected to the report of the Commissioner of Patents, in which will befound valuable suggestions and recommendations.On the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll of the United States numbered991,519. These include the pensioners of the Army and Navy in all our wars.The number added to the rolls during the year was 40,991. The numberdropped by reason of death, remarriage, minors by legal limitation, failureto claim within three years, and other causes, was 43, 186, and the numberof claims disallowed was 107,919. During the year 89,054 pensioncertificates were issued, of which 37,077 were for new or originalpensions. The amount disbursed for army and navy pensions during the yearwas $138,355,052.95, which was $1,651,461.61 less than the sum of theappropriations.The Grand Army of the Republic at its recent national encampment held inPhiladelphia has brought to my attention and to that of the Congress thewisdom and justice of a modification of the third section of the act ofJune 27, 1890, which provides pensions for the widows of officers andenlisted men who served ninety days or more during the War of the Rebellionand were honorably discharged, provided that such widows are without othermeans of sup, port than their daily labor and were married to the soldier,sailor, or marine on account of whose service they claim pension prior tothe date of the act.The present holding of the Department is that if the widow\'s income asidefrom her daily labor does not exceed in amount what her pension would be,to wit, $96 per annum, she would be deemed to be without other means ofsupport than her daily labor, and would be entitled to a pension under thisact; while if the widow\'s income independent of the amount received by heras the result of her daily labor exceeds $96, she would not be pensionableunder the act. I am advised by the Commissioner of Pensions that the amountof the income allowed before title to pension would be barred has variedwidely under different administrations of the Pension Office, as well asduring different periods of the same administration, and has been the causeof just complaint and criticism.With the approval of the Secretary of the Interior the Commissioner ofPensions recommends that, in order to make the practice at all timesuniform and to do justice to the dependent widow, the amount of incomeallowed independent of the proceeds of her daily labor should be not lessthan $250 per annum, and he urges that the Congress shall so amend the actas to permit the Pension Office to grant pensionable status to widows underthe terms of the third section of the act of June 27, 1890, whose incomeaside from the proceeds of daily labor is not in excess of $250 per annum.I believe this to be a simple act of justice and heartily recommend it.The Dawes Commission reports that gratifying progress has been made in itswork during the preceding year. The field work of enrollment of four of thenations has been completed. I recommend that Congress at an early day makeliberal appropriation for educational purposes in the Indian Territory.In accordance with the act of Congress approved March 3, 1899. thepreliminary work in connection with the Twelfth Census is now fully underway. The officers required for the proper administration of the dutiesimposed have been selected. The provision for securing a proper enumerationof the population, as well as to secure evidence of the industrial growthof the Nation, is broader and more comprehensive than any similarlegislation in the past. The Director advises that every needful effort isbeing made to push this great work to completion in the time limited by thestatute. It is believed that the Twelfth Census will emphasize ourremarkable advance in all that pertains to national progress.Under the authority of the act of Congress approved July 7, 1898, thecommission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, theAttorney General, and the Secretary of the Interior has made an agreementof settlement, which has had my approval, of the indebtedness to theGovernment growing out of the issue of bonds to aid in the construction ofthe Central Pacific and Western Pacific railroads. The agreement securesto the Government the principal and interest of said bonds, amounting to$58,812,715.48. There has been paid thereon $11,762,543.12, which has beencovered into the Treasury, and the remainder, payable within ten years,with interest at the rate Of 3 per cent per annum, payable semiannually, issecured by the deposit of an equal amount of first mortgage bonds of thePacific Railway companies. The amounts paid and secured to be paid to theGovernment on account of the Pacific Railroad subsidy claims are: UnionPacific, cash   $58,448,223.75Kansas Pacific, cash   6,303,000.00Central and Western Pacific, cash   11,798,314.14Notes, secured   47,050,172.36Kansas Pacific dividends for deficiency due United States, cash  821,897.70  
William McKinley
To the Senate and House of Representatives:At the outgoing of the old and the incoming of the new century you beginthe last session of the Fifty sixth Congress with evidences on every handof individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growingstrength and increasing power for good of Republican institutions. Yourcountrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is morefirmly established than ever before, and that love for it and thedetermination to preserve it are more universal than at any former periodof our history.The Republic was never so strong, because never so strongly entrenched inthe hearts of the people as now. The Constitution, with few amendments,exists as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have beenmade to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Populargovernment has demonstrated in its one hundred and twenty four years oftrial here its stability and security, and its efficiency as the bestinstrument of national development and the best safeguard to human rights.When the Sixth Congress assembled in November, 1800, the population of theUnited States was 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. Then we had sixteenStates. Now we have forty five. Then our territory consisted Of 909,050square miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles. Education, religion, andmorality have kept pace with our advancement in other directions, and whileextending its power the Government has adhered to its foundation principlesand abated none of them in dealing with our new peoples and possessions. Anation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and invokesHis guidance and the continuance of His care and favor.In our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment ofthe Chinese problem. Apart from this our relations with the powers havebeen happy.The recent troubles in China spring from the antiforeign agitation whichfor the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces.Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in thetraditions of their Government. The Taiping rebellion and the opening ofChinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike thehomogeneity and the seclusion of China.Meanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quarters, not alone onthe coast, but along the great river arteries and in the remoter districts,carrying new ideas and introducing new associations among a primitivepeople which had pursued for centuries a national policy of isolation.The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamersplying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating yearby year farther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types of analien invasion, changing the course of their national life and fraught withvague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and their self control.For several years before the present troubles all the resources of foreigndiplomacy, backed by moral demonstrations of the physical force of fleetsand arms, have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights offoreigners and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible authorities forthe sporadic outrages upon the persons and property of unoffendingsojourners, which from time to time occurred at widely separated points inthe northern provinces, as in the case of the outbreaks in Sze chuen andShan tung.Posting of antiforeign placards became a daily occurrence, which therepeated reprobation of the Imperial power failed to check or punish. Theseinflammatory appeals to the ignorance and superstition of the masses,mendacious and absurd in their accusations and deeply hostile in theirspirit, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no particularclass of foreigners; they were impartial in attacking everything foreign.An outbreak in Shan tung, in which German missionaries were slain, was thetoo natural result of these malevolent teachings.The posting of seditious placards, exhorting to the utter destruction offoreigners and of every foreign thing, continued unrebuked. Hostiledemonstrations toward the stranger gained strength by organization.The sect, commonly styled the Boxers, developed greatly in the provincesnorth of the Yang Tse, and with the collusion of many notable officials,including some in the immediate councils of the Throne itself, becamealarmingly aggressive. No foreigner\'s life, outside of the protected treatyports, was safe. No foreign interest was secure from spoliation.The diplomatic representatives of the powers in Peking strove in vain tocheck this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewedprotest, to be met with perfunctory edicts from the Palace and evasive andfutile assurances from the Tsung li Yamen. The circle of the Boxerinfluence narrowed about Peking, and while nominally stigmatized asseditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded the capital itself, thatthe Imperial forces were imbued with its doctrines, and that the immediatecounselors of the Empress Dowager were in full sympathy with theantiforeign movement.The increasing gravity of the conditions in China and the imminence ofperil to our own diversified interests in the Empire, as well as to thoseof all the other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by thisGovernment, causing it profound solicitude. The United States from theearliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy ofpeace, omitting no occasions to testify good will, to further the extensionof lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of its Government, and toinsure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measureof protection for the lives and property of our law abiding citizens andfor the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people.Mindful of this, it was felt to be appropriate that our purposes should bepronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of thepowers at Peking to promote the administrative reforms so greatly neededfor strengthening the Imperial Government and maintaining the integrity ofChina, in which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned.To these ends I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupyingterritory and maintaining spheres of influence in China the circularproposals of 1899, inviting from them declarations of their intentions andviews as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring thebenefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China.With gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy,enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiationsproof of the friendly spirit which animates the various powers interestedin the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the ChineseEmpire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world.In this conclusion, which I had the gratification to announce as acompleted engagement to the interested powers on March 20, 1900, Ihopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust offoreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policyof the Imperial Government, and for the effective exertion by it of powerand authority to quell the critical antiforeign movement in the northernprovinces most immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment.Seeking to testify confidence in the willingness and ability of theImperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils wesuffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Peking in theautumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at theearliest practicable moment, and all pending questions were remitted, asfar as we were concerned, to the ordinary resorts of diplomaticintercourse.The Chinese Government proved, however, unable to check the rising strengthof the Boxers and appeared to be a prey to internal dissensions. In theunequal contest the antiforeign influences soon gained the ascendancy underthe leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of Boxers, with which theImperial forces affiliated, held the country between Peking and the coast,penetrated into Manchuria up to the Russian borders, and through theiremissaries threatened a like rising throughout northern China.Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property, and slaughter ofnative converts were reported from all sides. The Tsung li Yamen, alreadypermeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective response to theappeals of the legations. At this critical juncture, in the early spring ofthis year, a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleetshould be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration, under coverof which to exact of the Chinese Government respect for foreign treatyrights and the suppression of the Boxers.The United States, while not participating in the joint demonstration,promptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared forservice on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at Takuand sent to Peking for the protection of the American legation. Otherpowers took similar action, until some four hundred men were assembled inthe capital as legation guards.Still the peril increased. The legations reported the development of theseditious movement in Peking and the need of increased provision fordefense against it. While preparations were in progress for a largerexpedition, to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open, anattempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by a firefrom the Chinese forts. The forts were thereupon shelled by the foreignvessels, the American admiral taking no part in the attack, on the groundthat we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration mightconsolidate the antiforeign elements and strengthen the Boxers to opposethe relieving column.Two days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict.Severance of communication with Peking followed, and a combined force ofadditional guards, which was advancing to Peking by the Pei Ho, was checkedat Langfang. The isolation of the legations was complete.The siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying history.In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted band,clinging to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted spirit that ledtheir relievers through battle and suffering to the goal, it is a memory ofwhich my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag wasmaintained alike in the siege and the rescue, and that stout Americanhearts have again set high, in fervent emulation with true men of otherrace and language, the indomitable courage that ever strives for the causeof right and justice.By June 19 the legations were cut off. An identical note from the, Yamenordered each minister to leave Peking, under a promised escort, withintwenty four hours. To gain time they replied, asking prolongation of thetime, which was afterwards granted, and requesting an interview with theTsung li Yamen on the following day. No reply being received, on themorning of the 20th the German minister, Baron von Ketteler, set out forthe Yamen to obtain a response, and oil the way was murdered.An attempt by the legation guard to recover his body was foiled by theChinese. Armed forces turned out against the legations. Their quarters weresurrounded and attacked. The mission compounds were abandoned, theirinmates taking refuge in the British legation, where all the otherlegations and guards gathered for more effective defense. Four hundredpersons were crowded in its narrow compass. Two thousand native convertswere assembled in a nearby palace under protection of the foreigners. Linesof defense were strengthened, trenches dug, barricades raised, andpreparations made to stand a siege, which at once began.From June 20 until July 17, writes Minister Conger, "there was scarcelyan hour during which there was not firing upon some part of our lines andinto some of the legations, varying from a single shot to a general andcontinuous attack along the whole line." Artillery was placed around thelegations and on the over looking palace walls, and thousands Of 3 inchshot and shell were fired, destroying some buildings and damaging all. Sothickly did the balls rain, that, when the ammunition of the besieged ranlow, five quarts of Chinese bullets were gathered in an hour in onecompound and recast.Attempts were made to burn the legations by setting neighboring houses onfire, but the flames were successfully fought off, although the Austrian,Belgian, Italian. and Dutch legations were then and subsequently burned.With the aid of the native converts, directed by the missionaries, to whosehelpful co operation Mr. Conger awards unstinted praise, the Britishlegation was made a veritable fortress. The British minister, Sir ClaudeMacDonald, was chosen general commander of the defense, with the secretaryof the American legation, Mr. E. G. Squiers, as chief of staff.To save life and ammunition the besieged sparingly returned the incessantfire of the Chinese soldiery, fighting only to repel attack or make anoccasional successful sortie for strategic advantage, such as that offifty five American, British, and Russian marines led by Captain Myers, ofthe United States Marine Corps, which resulted in the capture of aformidable barricade on the wall that gravely menaced the Americanposition. It was held to the last, and proved an invaluable acquisition,because commanding the water gate through which the relief column entered.During the siege the defenders lost 65 killed, 135 wounded, and 7 bydisease, the last all children.On July 14 the besieged had their first communication with the Tsung liYamen, from whom a message came inviting to a conference, which wasdeclined. Correspondence, however, ensued and a sort of armistice wasagreed upon, which stopped the bombardment and lessened the rifle fire fora time. Even then no protection whatever was afforded, nor any aid given,save to send to the legations a small supply of fruit and three sacks offlour.Indeed, the only communication had with the Chinese Government related tothe occasional delivery or dispatch of a telegram or to the demands of theTsung li Yamen for the withdrawal of the legations to the coast underescort. Not only are the protestations of the Chinese Government that itprotected and succored the legations positively contradicted, butirresistible proof accumulates that the attacks upon them were made byImperial troops, regularly uniformed, armed, and officered, belonging tothe command of Jung Lu, the Imperial commander in chief. Decreesencouraging the Boxers, organizing them tinder prominent Imperial officers,provisioning them, and even granting them large sums in the name of theEmpress Dowager, are known to exist. Members of the Tsung li Yamen whocounseled protection of the foreigners were beheaded. Even in the distantprovinces men suspected of foreign sympathy were put to death, prominentamong these being Chang Yen hoon, formerly Chinese minister in Washington.With the negotiation of the partial armistice of July 14, a proceedingwhich was doubtless promoted by the representations of the Chinese envoy inWashington, the way was opened for the conveyance to Mr. Conger of a testmessage sent by the Secretary of State through the kind offices of MinisterWu Ting fang. Mr. Conger\'s reply, dispatched from Peking on July 18 throughthe same channel, afforded to the outside world the first tidings that theinmates of the legations were still alive and hoping for succor.This news stimulated the preparations for a joint relief expedition innumbers sufficient to overcome the resistance which for a month had beenorganizing between Taku and the capital. Reinforcements sent by all theco operating Governments were constantly arriving. The United Statescontingent, hastily assembled from the Philippines or dispatched from thiscountry, amounted to some 5,000 men, under the able command first of thelamented Colonel Liscurn and afterwards of General Chaffee.Toward the end of July the movement began. A severe conflict followed atTientsin, in which Colonel Liscurn was killed. The city was stormed andpartly destroyed. Its capture afforded the base of operations from which tomake the final advance, which began in the first days of August, theexpedition being made up of Japanese, Russian, British, and American troopsat the outset.Another battle was fought and won at Yangtsun. Thereafter the disheartenedChinese troops offered little show of resistance. A few days later theimportant position of Ho si woo was taken. A rapid march brought the unitedforces to the populous city of Tung Chow, which capitulated without acontest.On August 14 the capital was reached. After a brief conflict beneath thewalls the relief column entered and the legations were saved. The UnitedStates soldiers, sailors, and marines, officers and men alike, in thosedistant climes and unusual surroundings, showed the same valor, discipline,and good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of intelligence andefficiency which have distinguished them in every emergency.The Imperial family and the Government had fled a few days before. The citywas without visible control. The remaining Imperial soldiery had made onthe night of the 13th a last attempt to exterminate the besieged, which wasgallantly repelled. It fell to the occupying forces to restore order andorganize a provisional administration.Happily the acute disturbances were confined to the northern provinces. Itis a relief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal conduct of theviceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern provinces. Theirefforts were continuously directed to the pacific control of the vastpopulations under their rule and to the scrupulous observance of foreigntreaty rights. At critical moments they did not hesitate to memorialize theThrone, urging the protection of the legations, the restoration ofcommunication, and the assertion of the Imperial authority against thesubversive elements. They maintained excellent relations with the officialrepresentatives of foreign powers. To their kindly disposition is largelydue the success of the consuls in removing many of the missionaries fromthe interior to places of safety. In this relation the action of theconsuls should be highly commended. In Shan tung and eastern Chi li thetask was difficult, but, thanks to their energy and the cooperation ofAmerican and foreign naval commanders, hundreds of foreigners, includingthose of other nationalities than ours, were rescued from imminent peril.The policy of the United States through all this trying period was clearlyannounced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers datedJuly 3 proclaimed our attitude. Treating the condition in the north as oneof virtual anarchy, in which the great provinces of the south and southeasthad no share, we regarded the local authorities in the latter quarters asrepresenting the Chinese people with whom we sought to remain in peace andfriendship. Our declared aims involved no war against the Chinese nation.We adhered to the legitimate office of rescuing the imperiled legation,obtaining redress for wrongs already suffered, securing wherever possiblethe safety of American life and property in China, and preventing a spreadof the disorders or their recurrence.As was then said, "The policy of the Government of the United States is toseek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China,preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rightsguaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, andsafeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with allparts of the Chinese Empire."Faithful to those professions which, as it proved, reflected the views andpurposes of the other co operating Governments, all our efforts have beendirected toward ending the anomalous situation in China by negotiations fora settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty ofrelieving our legation and its dependents was accomplished we withdrew fromactive hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Pekingas a channel of negotiation and settlement a course adopted by others ofthe interested powers. Overtures of the empowered representatives of theChinese Emperor have been considerately entertained.The Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Imperial power inPeking has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires, for wehave held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and anenduring settlement that will make their recurrence impossible can best bebrought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences andobeys. While so doing we forego no jot of our undoubted right to exactexemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible authors and abettorsof the criminal acts whereby we and other nations have suffered grievousinjury.For the real culprits, the evil counselors who have misled the Imperialjudgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends,full expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of retributiveJustice. Regarding this as the initial condition of an acceptablesettlement between China and the powers, I said in my message of October 18to the Chinese Emperor: I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as weand the other offended Governments shall be effectively satisfied of YourMajesty\'s ability and power to treat with just sternness the principaloffenders, who are doubly culpable, not alone toward the foreigners, buttoward Your Majesty, under whose rule the purpose of China to dwell inconcord with the world had hitherto found expression in the welcome andprotection assured to strangers. Taking, as a point of departure, theImperial edict appointing Earl Li Hung Chang and Prince Chingplenipotentiaries to arrange a settlement, and the edict of September 25,whereby certain high officials were designated for punishment, thisGovernment has moved, in concert with the other powers, toward the openingof negotiations, which Mr. Conger, assisted by Mr. Rockhill, has beenauthorized to conduct on behalf of the United States.General bases of negotiation formulated by the Government of the FrenchRepublic have been accepted with certain reservations as to details, madenecessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations by otherpowers, open to discussion in the progress of the negotiations. Thedisposition of the Emperor\'s Government to admit liability for wrongs doneto foreign Governments and their nationals, and to act upon such additionaldesignation of the guilty persons as the foreign ministers at Peking may bein a position to make, gives hope of a complete settlement of all questionsinvolved, assuring foreign rights of residence and intercourse on terms ofequality for all the world.I regard as one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment thesecurement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since insecurity ofthose natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less effectualassault upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would be thedirect invasion thereof.The matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of graveconcern. Measured in money alone, a sufficient reparation may prove to bebeyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur in emphaticdisclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismemberment ofthe Empire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made inpart by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities,and, most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerceof all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated byour representatives.The Government of Russia has put forward a suggestion, that in the event ofprotracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities the matter may berelegated to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague. I favorably incline tothis, believing that high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution noless conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itselfthan immediately beneficial to the powers.Ratifications of a treaty of extradition with the Argentine Republic wereexchanged on June 2 last.While the Austro Hungarian Government has in the many cases that have beenreported of the arrest of our naturalized citizens for alleged evasion ofmilitary service faithfully observed the provisions of the treaty andreleased such persons from military obligations, it has in some instancesexpelled those whose presence in the community of their origin was assertedto have a pernicious influence. Representations have been made against thiscourse whenever its adoption has appeared unduly onerous.We have been urgently solicited by Belgium to ratify the InternationalConvention of June, 1899, amendatory of the previous Convention of 1890 inrespect to the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa. Compliance wasnecessarily withheld, in the absence of the advice and consent of theSenate thereto. The principle involved has the cordial sympathy of thisGovernment, which in the reversionary negotiations advocated more drasticmeasures, and I would gladly see its extension, by international agreement,to the restriction of the liquor traffic with all uncivilized peoples,especially in the Western Pacific.A conference will be held at Brussels December 11, 1900, under theConvention for the protection of industrial property, concluded at ParisMarch 20, 1883, to which delegates from this country have been appointed.Any lessening of the difficulties that our inventors encounter in obtainingpatents abroad for their inventions and that our farmers, manufacturers,and merchants may have in the protection of their trade marks is worthy ofcareful consideration, and your attention will be called to the results ofthe conference at the proper time.In the interest of expanding trade between this country and South America,efforts have been made during the past year to conclude conventions withthe southern republics for the enlargement of postal facilities. Two suchagreements, signed with Bolivia on April 24, of which that establishing themoney order system is undergoing certain changes suggested by thePost Office Department, have not yet been ratified by this Government. Atreaty of extradition with that country, signed on the same day, is beforethe Senate.A boundary dispute between Brazil and Bolivia over the territory of Acre isin a fair way of friendly adjustment, a protocol signed in December, 1899,having agreed on a definite frontier and provided for its demarcation by ajoint commission.Conditions in Brazil have weighed heavily on our export trade to thatcountry in marked contrast to the favorable conditions upon which Brazilianproducts are admitted into our markets. Urgent representations have beenmade to that Government on the subject and some amelioration has beeneffected. We rely upon the reciprocal justice and good will of thatGovernment to assure to us a further improvement in our commercialrelations.The Convention signed May 24, 1897, for the final settlement of claims leftin abeyance upon the dissolution of the Commission of 1893, was at lengthratified by the Chilean Congress and the supplemental Commission has beenorganized.It remains for the Congress to appropriate for the necessary expenses ofthe Commission.The insurrectionary movement which disturbed Colombia in the latter part of1899 has been practically suppressed, although guerrillas still operate insome departments. The executive power of that Republic changed hands inAugust last by the act of Vice President Marroquin in assuming the reins ofgovernment during the absence of President San Clemente from the capital.The change met with no serious opposition, and, following the precedents insuch cases, the United States minister entered into relations with the newdefacto Government on September 17.It is gratifying to announce that the residual questions between Costa Ricaand Nicaragua growing out of the Award of President Cleveland in 1888 havebeen adjusted through the choice of an American engineer, General E. P.Alexander, as umpire to run the disputed line. His task has beenaccomplished to the satisfaction of both contestants.A revolution in the Dominican Republic toward the close of last yearresulted in the installation of President Jimenez, whose Government wasformally recognized in January. Since then final payment has been made ofthe American claim in regard to the Ozama bridge.The year of the exposition has been fruitful in occasions for displayingthe good will that exists between this country and France. This greatcompetition brought together from every nation the best in naturalproductions, industry, science, and the arts, submitted in generous rivalryto a judgment made all the more searching because of that rivalry. Theextraordinary increase of exportations from this country during the pastthree years and the activity with which our inventions and wares hadinvaded new markets caused much interest to center upon the Americanexhibit, and every encouragement was offered in the way of space andfacilities to permit of its being comprehensive as a whole and complete inevery part.It was, however, not an easy task to assemble exhibits that could fitlyillustrate our diversified resources and manufactures. Singularly enough,our national prosperity lessened the incentive to exhibit. The dealer inraw materials knew that the user must come to him; the great factories werecontented with the phenomenal demand for their output, not alone at home,but also abroad, where merit had already won a profitable trade.Appeals had to be made to the patriotism of exhibitors to induce them toincur outlays promising no immediate return. This was especially the casewhere it became needful to complete an industrial sequence or illustrate aclass of processes. One manufacturer after another had to be visited andimportuned, and at times, after a promise to exhibit in a particularsection had been obtained, it would be withdrawn, owing to pressure oftrade orders, and a new quest would have to be made.The installation of exhibits, too, encountered many obstacles and involvedunexpected cost. The exposition was far from ready at the date fixed forits opening. The French transportation lines were congested with offeredfreight. Belated goods had to be hastily installed in unfinished quarterswith whatever labor could be obtained in the prevailing confusion. Nor wasthe task of the Commission lightened by the fact that, owing to the schemeof classification adopted, it was impossible to have the entire exhibit ofany one country in the same building or more than one group of exhibits inthe same part of any building. Our installations were scattered on bothsides of the Seine and in widely remote suburbs of Paris, so thatadditional assistants were needed for the work of supervision andarrangement.Despite all these drawbacks the contribution of the United States was notonly the largest foreign display, but was among the earliest in place andthe most orderly in arrangement. Our exhibits were shown in one hundred andone out of one hundred and twenty one classes, and more completely coveredthe entire classification than those of any other nation. In total numberthey ranked next after those of France, and the attractive form in whichthey were presented secured general attention.A criterion of the extent and success of our participation and of thethoroughness with which our exhibits were organized is seen in the awardsgranted to American exhibitors by the international jury, namely, grandprizes, 240; gold medals, 597; silver medals, 776; bronze medals, 541, andhonorable mentions, 322 2,476 in all, being the greatest total numbergiven to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation, as well as the largestnumber in each grade. This significant recognition of merit in competitionwith the chosen exhibits of all other nations and at the hands of juriesalmost wholly made up of representatives of France and other competingcountries is not only most gratifying, but is especially valuable, since itsets us to the front in international questions of supply and demand, whilethe large proportion of awards in the classes of art and artisticmanufactures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of nationalculture by the prosperity that flows from natural productiveness joined toindustrial excellence.Apart from the exposition several occasions for showing international goodwill occurred. The inauguration in Paris of the Lafayette Monument,presented by the school children of the United States, and the designing ofa commemorative coin by our Mint and the presentation of the first piecestruck to the President of the Republic, were marked by appropriateceremonies, and the Fourth of July was especially observed in the Frenchcapital.Good will prevails in our relations with the German Empire. An amicableadjustment of the long pending question of the admission of ourlife insurance companies to do business in Prussia has been reached. One ofthe principal companies has already been readmitted and the way is openedfor the others to share the privilege.The settlement of the Samoan problem, to which I adverted in my lastmessage, has accomplished good results. Peace and contentment prevail inthe islands, especially in Tutuila, where a convenient administration thathas won the confidence and esteem of the kindly disposed natives has beenorganized under the direction of the commander of the United States navalstation at Pago Pago.An Imperial meat inspection law has been enacted for Germany. While it maysimplify the inspections, it prohibits certain products heretoforeadmitted. There is still great uncertainty as to whether our well nighextinguished German trade in meat products can revive tinder its newburdens. Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated, which weconfidently hope will be free from the discriminations which attended theenforcement of the old statutes.The remaining link in the new lines of direct telegraphic communicationbetween the United States and the German Empire has recently beencompleted, affording a gratifying occasion for exchange of friendlycongratulations with the German Emperor.Our friendly relations with Great Britain continue. The war in SouthernAfrica introduced important questions. A condition unusual in internationalwars was presented in that while one belligerent had control of the seas,the other had no ports, shipping, or direct trade, but was only accessiblethrough the territory of a neutral. Vexatious questions arose through GreatBritain\'s action in respect to neutral cargoes, not contraband in their ownnature, shipped to Portuguese South Africa, on the score of probable orsuspected ultimate destination to the Boer States.Such consignments in British ships, by which alone direct trade is kept upbetween our ports and Southern Africa, were seized in application of amunicipal law prohibiting British vessels from trading with the enemywithout regard to any contraband character of the goods, while cargoesshipped to Delagoa Bay in neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground ofalleged destination to enemy\'s country. Appropriate representations on ourpart resulted in the British Government agreeing to purchase outright allsuch goods shown to be the actual property of American citizens, thusclosing the incident to the satisfaction of the immediately interestedparties, although, unfortunately, without a broad settlement of thequestion of a neutral\'s right to send goods not contraband per se to aneutral port adjacent to a belligerent area.The work of marking certain provisional boundary points, for convenience ofadministration, around the head of Lynn Canal, in accordance with thetemporary arrangement of October, 1899, Was completed by a joint survey inJuly last. The modus vivendi has so far worked without friction, and theDominion Government has provided rules and regulations for securing to ourcitizens the benefit of the reciprocal stipulation that the citizens orsubjects of either power found by that arrangement within the temporaryjurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the rights andprivileges they have hitherto enjoyed. But however necessary such anexpedient may have been to tide over the grave emergencies of thesituation, it is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should notbe suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the frontierline to which we are entitled under the Russo American treaty for thecession of Alaska.In this relation I may refer again to the need of definitely marking theAlaskan boundary where it follows the one hundred and forty first meridian.A convention to that end has been before the Senate for some two years, butas no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a new convention fora joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observations. These,it is believed, will give more accurate and unquestionable results than thesidereal methods heretofore independently followed, which, as is known,proved discrepant at several points on the line, although not varying atany place more than 700 feet.The pending claim of R. H. May against the Guatemalan Government has beensettled by arbitration, Mr. George F. B. Jenner, British minister atGuatemala, who was chosen as sole arbitrator, having awarded $143,750.73 ingold to the claimant.Various American claims against Haiti have been or are being advanced tothe resort of arbitration.As the result of negotiations with the Government of Honduras in regard tothe indemnity demanded for the murder of Frank H. Pears in Honduras, thatGovernment has paid $10,000 in settlement of the claim of the heirs.The assassination of King Humbert called forth sincere expressions ofsorrow from this Government and people, and occasion was fitly taken totestify to the Italian nation the high regard here felt for the memory ofthe lamented ruler.In my last message I referred at considerable length to the lynching offive Italians at Tallulah. Notwithstanding the efforts of the FederalGovernment, the production of evidence tending to inculpate the authors ofthis grievous offense against our civilization, and the repeated inquestsset on foot by the authorities of the State of Louisiana, no punishmentshave followed. Successive grand juries have failed to indict. Therepresentations of the Italian Government in the face of this miscarriagehave been most temperate and just.Setting the principle at issue high above all consideration of merelypecuniary indemnification, such as this Government made in the threeprevious cases, Italy has solemnly invoked the pledges of existing treatyand asked that the justice to which she is entitled shall be meted inregard to her unfortunate countrymen in our territory with the same fullmeasure she herself would give to any American were his reciprocal treatyrights contemned.I renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that the Congressappropriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class ofinternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the FederalGovernment may be involved, and I invite action upon the bills toaccomplish this which were introduced in the Sen. ate and House. It isincumbent upon us to remedy the statutory omission which has led, and mayagain lead, to such untoward results. I have pointed out the necessity andthe precedent for legislation of this character. Its enactment is a simplemeasure of previsory justice toward the nations with which we as asovereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal observance.While the Italian Government naturally regards such action as the primaryand, indeed, the most essential element in the disposal of the Tallulahincident, I advise that, in accordance with precedent, and in view of theimprobability of that particular case being reached by the bill nowpending, Congress make gracious provision for indemnity to the Italiansufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore.In my inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching inthese words: Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilizedcountry like the United States; courts, not mobs, must execute thepenalties of the law. The preservation of public order, the right ofdiscussion, the integrity of courts, and the orderly administration ofjustice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Governmentsecurely rests. This I most urgently reiterate and again invite theattention of my countrymen to this reproach upon our civilization.The closing year has witnessed a decided strengthening of Japan\'s relationsto other states. The development of her independent judicial andadministrative functions under the treaties which took effect July 17,1899, has proceeded without international friction, showing the competenceof the Japanese to hold a foremost place among modern peoples.In the treatment of the difficult Chinese problems Japan has acted inharmonious concert with the other powers, and her generous cooperationmaterially aided in the joint relief of the beleaguered legations in Pekingand in bringing about an understanding preliminary to a settlement of theissues between the powers and China. Japan\'s declarations in favor of theintegrity of the Chinese Empire and the conservation of open world tradetherewith have been frank and positive. As a factor for promoting thegeneral interests of peace, order, and fair commerce in the Far East theinfluence of Japan can hardly be overestimated.The valuable aid and kindly courtesies extended by the Japanese Governmentand naval officers to the battle ship Oregon are gratefully appreciated.Complaint was made last summer of the discriminatory enforcement of abubonic quarantine against Japanese on the Pacific coast and ofinterference with their travel in California and Colorado under the healthlaws of those States. The latter restrictions have been adjudged by aFederal court to be unconstitutional. No recurrence of either cause ofcomplaint is apprehended.No noteworthy incident has occurred in our relations with our importantsouthern neighbor. Commercial intercourse with Mexico continues to thrive,and the two Governments neglect no opportunity to foster their mutualinterests in all practicable ways.Pursuant to the declaration of the Supreme Court that the awards of thelate joint Commission in the La Abra and Weil claims were obtained throughfraud, the sum awarded in the first case, $403,030.08, has been returned toMexico, and the amount of the Weil award will be returned in like manner.A Convention indefinitely extending the time for the labors of the UnitedStates and Mexican International (Water) Boundary Commission has beensigned.It is with satisfaction that I am able to announce the formal notificationat The Hague, on September 4, of the deposit of ratifications of theConvention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes by sixteenpowers, namely, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England,France, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Spain,Sweden and Norway, and the Netherlands. Japan also has since ratified theConvention.The Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration has beenorganized and has adopted rules of order and a constitution for theInternational Arbitration Bureau. In accordance with Article XXIII of theConvention providing for the appointment by each signatory power of personsof known competency in questions of international law as arbitrators, Ihave appointed as members of this Court, Hon. Benjamin Harrison, ofIndiana, ex President of the United States; Hon. Melville W. Fuller, ofIllinois, Chief justice of the United States; Hon. John W. Griggs, of NewJersey, Attorney General of the United States; and Hon. George Gray, ofDelaware, a judge of the circuit court of the United States.As an incident of the brief revolution in the Mosquito district ofNicaragua early in 1899 the insurgents forcibly collected from Americanmerchants duties upon imports. On the restoration of order the Nicaraguanauthorities demanded a second payment of such duties on the ground thatthey were due to the titular Government and that their diversion had aidedthe revolt.This position was not accepted by us. After prolonged discussion acompromise was effected under which the amount of the second payments wasdeposited with the British consul at San Juan del Norte in trust until thetwo Governments should determine whether the first payments had been madeunder compulsion to a de facto authority. Agreement as to this was notreached, and the point was waived by the act of the Nicaraguan Governmentin requesting the British consul to return the deposits to the merchants.Menacing differences between several of the Central American States havebeen accommodated, our ministers rendering good offices toward anunderstanding.The all important matter of an interoceanic canal has assumed a new phase.Adhering to its refusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture of thecontract of the Maritime Canal Company, which was terminated for allegednonexecution in October, 1899, the Government of Nicaragua has sincesupplemented that action by declaring the so styled Eyre Cragin option voidfor nonpayment of the stipulated advance. Protests in relation to theseacts have been filed in the State Department and are under consideration.Deeming itself relieved from existing engagements, the NicaraguanGovernment shows a disposition to deal freely with the canal questioneither in the way of negotiations with the United States or by takingmeasures to promote the waterway.Overtures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under theauspices of the United States are under consideration. In the meantime, theviews of the Congress upon the general subject, in the light of the reportof the Commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of thevarious trans Isthmian ship canal projects, may be awaited.I commend to the early attention of the Senate the Convention with GreatBritain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and to remove anyobjection which might arise out of the Convention commonly called theClayton Bulwer Treaty.The long standing contention with Portugal, growing out of the seizure ofthe Delagoa Bay Railway, has been at last determined by a favorable awardof the tribunal of arbitration at Berne, to which it was submitted. Theamount of the award, which was deposited in London awaiting arrangements bythe Governments of the United States and Great Britain for its disposal,has recently been paid over to the two Governments.A lately signed Convention of Extradition with Peru as amended by theSenate has been ratified by the Peruvian Congress.Another illustration of the policy of this Government to referinternational disputes to impartial arbitration is seen in the agreementreached with Russia to submit the claims on behalf of American sealingvessels seized in Bering Sea to determination by Mr. T. M. C. Asser, adistinguished statesman and jurist of the Netherlands.Thanks are due to the Imperial Russian Government for the kindly aidrendered by its authorities in eastern Siberia to American missionariesfleeing from Manchuria.Satisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a generaltreaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain, in replacement of the oldtreaty, which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war. A newconvention of extradition is approaching completion, and I should be muchpleased were a commercial arrangement to follow. I feel that we should notsuffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that existedbetween us and Spain from the time of our earliest independence, and toenhance the mutual benefits of that commercial intercourse which is naturalbetween the two countries.By the terms of the Treaty of Peace the line bounding the ceded Philippinegroup in the southwest failed to include several small islands lyingwestward of the Sulus, which have always been recognized as under Spanishcontrol. The occupation of Sibutd and Cagayan Sulu by our naval forceselicited a claim on the part of Spain, the essential equity of which couldnot be gainsaid. In order to cure the defect of the treaty by removing allpossible ground of future misunderstanding respecting the interpretation ofits third article, I directed the negotiation of a supplementary treaty,which will be forthwith laid before the Senate, whereby Spain quits alltitle and claim of title to the islands named as well as to any and allislands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago lying outside the linesdescribed in said third article, and agrees that all such islands shall becomprehended in the cession of the archipelago as fully as if they had beenexpressly included within those lines. In consideration of this cession theUnited States is to pay to Spain the sum of $100,000.A bill is now pending to effect the recommendation made in my last annualmessage that appropriate legislation be had to carry into execution ArticleVII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the United States assumedthe payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against Spain.I ask that action be taken to fulfill this obligation.The King of Sweden and Norway has accepted the joint invitation of theUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain to arbitrate claims growing outof losses sustained in the Samoan Islands in the course of militaryoperations made necessary by the disturbances in 1899.Our claims upon the Government of the Sultan for reparation for injuriessuffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere give promise ofearly and satisfactory settlement. His Majesty\'s good disposition in thisregard has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding theAmerican college at Harpoot.The failure of action by the Senate at its last session upon the commercialconventions then submitted for its consideration and approval, althoughcaused by the great pressure of other legislative business, has caused muchdisappointment to the agricultural and industrial interests of the country,which hoped to profit by their provisions. The conventional periods fortheir ratification having expired, it became necessary to sign additionalarticles extending the time for that purpose. This was requested on ourpart, and the other Governments interested have concurred with theexception of one convention, in respect to which no formal reply has beenreceived.Since my last communication to the Congress on this subject specialcommercial agreements under the third section of the tariff act have beenproclaimed with Portugal, with Italy, and with Germany. Commercialconventions tinder the general limitations of the fourth section of thesame act have been concluded with Nicaragua, with Ecuador, with theDominican Republic, with Great Britain on behalf of the island of Trinidad,and with Denmark on behalf of the island of St. Croix. These will be earlycommunicated to the Senate. Negotiations with other Governments are inprogress for the improvement and security of our commercial relations.The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles ofinternational equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people ofthe United States that there ought to be no hesitation in either branch ofthe Congress in giving to it full effect.This Government desires to preserve the most just and amicable commercialrelations with all foreign countries, unmoved by the industrial rivalriesnecessarily developed in the expansion of international trade. It isbelieved that the foreign Governments generally entertain the same purpose,although in some instances there are clamorous demands upon them forlegislation specifically hostile to American interests. Should thesedemands prevail I shall communicate with the Congress with the view ofadvising such legislation as may be necessary to meet the emergency.The exposition of the resources and products of the Western Hemisphere tobe held at Buffalo next year promises important results not only for theUnited States but for the other participating countries. It is gratifyingthat the Latin American States have evinced the liveliest interest, and thefact that an International American Congress will be held in the City ofMexico while the exposition is in progress encourages the hope of a largerdisplay at Buffalo than might otherwise be practicable. The work ofpreparing an exhibit of our national resources is making satisfactoryprogress under the direction of different officials of the FederalGovernment, and the various States of the Union have shown a dispositiontoward the most liberal participation in the enterprise.The Bureau of the American Republics continues to discharge, with thehappiest results, the important work of promoting cordial relations betweenthe United States and the Latin American countries, all of which are nowactive members of the International Union. The Bureau has been instrumentalin bringing about the agreement for another International AmericanCongress, which is to meet in the City of Mexico in October, 1901. TheBureau\'s future for another term of ten years is assured by theinternational compact, but the congress will doubtless have much to do withshaping new lines of work and a general policy. Its usefulness to theinterests of Latin American trade is widely appreciated and shows agratifying development.The practical utility of the consular service in obtaining a wide range ofinformation as to the industries and commerce of other countries and theopportunities thereby afforded for introducing the sale of our goods havekept steadily in advance of the notable expansion of our foreign trade, andabundant evidence has been furnished, both at home and abroad, of the factthat the Consular Reports, including many from our diplomaticrepresentatives, have to a considerable extent pointed out ways and meansof disposing of a great variety of manufactured goods which otherwise mightnot have found sale abroad.Testimony of foreign observers to the commercial efficiency of the consularcorps seems to be conclusive, and our own manufacturers and exportershighly appreciate the value of the services rendered not only in theprinted reports but also in the individual efforts of consular officers topromote American trade. An increasing part of the work of the Bureau ofForeign Commerce, whose primary duty it is to compile and print thereports, is to answer inquiries from trade organizations, business houses,etc., as to conditions in various parts of the world, and, notwithstandingthe smallness of the force employed, the work has been so systematized thatresponses are made with such promptitude and accuracy as to elicitflattering encomiums. The experiment of printing the Consular Reports dailyfor immediate use by trade bodies, exporters, and the press, which wasbegun in January, 1898, continues to give general satisfaction.It is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for thefiscal year ended June 30, 1900, were $79,527,060.18. For the six precedingyears we had only deficits, the aggregate of which from 1894 to 1899,inclusive, amounted to $283,022,991.14. The receipts for the year from allsources, exclusive of postal revenues, aggregated $567,240,851.89, andexpenditures for all purposes, except for the administration of the postaldepartment, aggregated $487,713,791.71. The receipts from customs were$233,164,871.16, an increase over the preceding year Of $27,036,389.41. Thereceipts from internal revenue were $295,327,926.76, an increase Of$21,890,765.25 over 1899. The receipts from miscellaneous sources were$38,748,053.97, as against $36,394,976.92 for the previous year.It is gratifying also to note that during the year a considerable reductionis shown in the expenditures of the Government. The War Departmentexpenditures for the fiscal year 1900 were $134,774,767.78, a reduction of$95,066,486.69 over those of 1899. In the Navy Department the expenditureswere $55,953,077.72 for the year 1900, as against $63,942,104.25 for thepreceding year, a decrease of $7,989,026.53. In the expenditures on accountof Indians there was a decrease in 1900 over 1899 Of $2,630,604.38; and inthe civil and miscellaneous expenses for 1900 there was a reduction Of$13,418,065.74.Because of the excess of revenues over expenditures the Secretary of theTreasury was enabled to apply bonds and other securities to the sinkingfund to the amount Of $56,544,556.06. The details of the sinking fund areset forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I inviteattention. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts forthe current fiscal year will aggregate $580,000,000 and the expenditures$500,000,000, leaving an excess of revenues over expenditures of$80,000,000. The present condition of the Treasury is one of undoubtedstrength. The available cash balance November 30 was $139,303,794.50. Underthe form of statement prior to the financial law of March 14 last therewould have been included in the statement of available cash gold coin andbullion held for the redemption of United States notes.If this form were pursued, the cash balance including the present goldreserve of $150,000,000, would be $289,303,794.50. Such balance November30, 1899, was $296,495,301.55. In the general fund, which is whollyseparate from the reserve and trust funds, there was on November 30,$70,090,073.15 in gold coin and bullion, to which should be added$22,957,300 in gold certificates subject to issue, against which there isheld in the Division of Redemption gold coin and bullion, making a totalholding of free gold amounting to $93,047,373.15.It will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the Congressto provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the continuedparity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money, silverand gold.Our surplus revenues have permitted the Secretary of the Treasury since theclose of the fiscal year to call in the funded loan of 1891 continued at 2per cent, in the sum of $25,364,500. To and including November 30,$23,458,100 Of these bonds have been paid. This sum, together with theamount which may accrue from further redemptions under the call, will beapplied to the sinking fund.The law of March 14, 1900, provided for refunding into 2 per centthirty year bonds, payable, principal and interest, in gold coin of thepresent standard value, that portion of the public debt represented by the3 per cent bonds of 1908, the 4 percents Of 1907, and the 5 percents of1904, Of which there was outstanding at the date of said law $839,149,930,The holders of the old bonds presented them for exchange between March 14and November 30 to the amount of $364,943,750. The net saving to theGovernment on these transactions aggregates $9,106,166.Another effect of the operation, as stated by the Secretary, is to reducethe charge upon the Treasury for the payment of interest from the dates ofrefunding to February 1, 1904, by the sum of more than seven milliondollars annually. From February 1, 1904, to July 1, 11907, the annualinterest charge will be reduced by the sum of more than five millions, andfor the thirteen months ending August 1, 1908, by about one million. Thefull details of the refunding are given in the annual report of theSecretary of the Treasury.The beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900, so far as it relates toa modification of the national banking act, is already apparent. Theprovision for the incorporation of national banks with a capital of notless than $25,000 in places not exceeding three thousand inhabitants hasresulted in the extension of banking facilities to many small communitieshitherto unable to provide themselves with banking institutions under thenational system. There were organized from the enactment of the law up toand including November 30, 369 national banks, of which 266 were withcapital less than $50,000, and 103 with capital of $50,000 or more.It is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organizedunder the new law are in sections where the need of banking facilities hasbeen most pronounced. Iowa stands first, with 30 banks of the smallerclass, while Texas, Oklahoma, Indian Territory, and the middle and westernsections of the country have also availed themselves largely of theprivileges under the new law.A large increase in national bank note circulation has resulted from theprovision of the act which permits national banks to issue circulatingnotes to the par value of the United States bonds deposited as securityinstead of only go per cent thereof, as heretofore. The increase incirculating notes from March 14 to November 30 is $77,889,570.The party in power is committed to such legislation as will better make thecurrency responsive to the varying needs of business at all seasons and inall sections.Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrialprogress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in thehistory of the country exceeded two billions of dollars. The exports aregreater than they have ever been before, the total for the fiscal year 1900being $1,394,483,082, an increase over 1899 of $167,459,780, an increaseover 1898 of $163,000,752, over 1897 Of $343,489,526, and greater than 1896by $511,876,144.The growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the factthat exports of manufactured products largely exceed those of any previousyear, their value for 1900 being $433,851,756, against $339,592,146 in1899, an increase of 28 per cent.Agricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume thanin 1899, the total for the year being $835,858,123, against $784,776,142 in1899.The imports for the year amounted to $849,941,184, an increase over 1899 of$152,792,695. This increase is largely in materials for manufacture, and isin response to the rapid development of manufacturing in the United States.While there was imported for use in manufactures in 1900 material to thevalue of $79,768,972 in excess of 1899, it is reassuring to observe thatthere is a tendency toward decrease in the importation of articlesmanufactured ready for consumption, which in 1900 formed 15.17 per cent ofthe total imports, against 15.54 per cent in 1899 and 21.09 per cent in1896.I recommend that the Congress at its present session reduce theinternal revenue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with Spain.in the sum of thirty millions of dollars. This reduction should be securedby the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the mostburdensome to the industries of the people.I specially urge that there be included in whatever reduction is made thelegacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary, educational, orcharitable character.American vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per centof our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, not thegreatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steelindustries, the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade, and oursteadily maintained expenditures for the Navy have created an opportunityto place the United States in the first rank of commercial maritime powers.Besides realizing a proper national aspiration this will mean theestablishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctivenational industry, expanding the field for the profitable employment oflabor and capital. It will increase the transportation facilities andreduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from theinterior to the seaboard for export, and will strengthen an arm of thenational defense upon which the founders of the Government and theirsuccessors have relied. In again urging immediate action by the Congress onmeasures to promote American shipping and foreign trade, I direct attentionto the recommendations on the subject in previous messages, andparticularly to the opinion expressed in the message of 1899: I amsatisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to ourmerchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuildour sea carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture,which, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and wages to ourcountrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part ofthe world. The attention of the Congress is invited to the recommendationof the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report for legislation inbehalf of the Revenue Cutter Service, and favorable action is urged.In my last annual message to the Congress I called attention to thenecessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to existin connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts, and againinvite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time, whichconcluded with these words: It is apparent that uniformity of legislationupon this subject in the several States is much to be desired. It is to behoped that such uniformity, founded in a wise and just discriminationbetween what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in businessoperations, may be obtained, and that means may be found for the Congress,within the limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement aneffective code of State legislation as to make a complete system of lawsthroughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of thesalutary rules to which I have referred.The whole question is so important and far reaching that I am sure no partof it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have thestudied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judiciousaction. Restraint upon such combinations as are injurious, and which arewithin Federal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the Congress.In my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition ofaffairs in the Philippines. While seeking to impress upon you that thegrave responsibility of the future government of those islands rests withthe Congress of the United States, I abstained from recommending at thattime a specific and final form of government for the territory actuallyheld by the United States forces and in which as long as insurrectioncontinues the military arm must necessarily be supreme. I stated mypurpose, until the Congress shall have made the formal expression of itswill, to use the authority vested in me by the Constitution and thestatutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distantislands as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats, placing,to that end, at the disposal of the army and navy all the means which theliberality of the Congress and the people have provided. No contraryexpression of the will of the Congress having been made, I have steadfastlypursued the purpose so declared, employing the civil arm as well toward theaccomplishment of pacification and the institution of local governmentswithin the lines of authority and law.Progress in the hoped for direction has been favorable. Our forces havesuccessfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming theorganized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrativeregularity to all quarters. What opposition remains is for the most partscattered, obeying no concerted plan of strategic action, operating only bythe methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which, whileineffective to alter the general control now established, are stillsufficient to beget insecurity among the populations that have felt thegood results of our control and thus delay the conferment upon them of thefuller measures of local self government, of education, and of industrialand agricultural development which we stand ready to give to them.By the spring of this year the effective opposition of the dissatisfiedTagals to the authority of the United States was virtually ended, thusopening the door for the extension of a stable administration over much ofthe territory of the Archipelago. Desiring to bring this about, I appointedin March last a civil Commission composed of the Hon. William H. Taft, ofOhio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; the Hon. Luke I. Wright, ofTennessee; the Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof. Bernard Moses, ofCalifornia. The aims of their mission and the scope of their authority areclearly set forth in my instructions of April 7, 1900, addressed to theSecretary of War to be transmitted to them:In the message transmitted to the Congress on the 5th of December, 1899, Isaid, speaking of the Philippine Islands: "As long as the insurrectioncontinues the military arm must necessarily be supreme. But there is noreason why steps should not be taken from time to time to inaugurategovernments essentially popular in their form as fast as territory is heldand controlled by our troops. To this end I am considering the advisabilityof the return of the Commission, or such of the members thereof as can besecured, to aid the existing authorities and facilitate this workthroughout the islands."To give effect to the intention thus expressed, I have appointed Hon.William H. Taft, of Ohio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; Non. LukeI. Wright, of Tennessee; Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof. BernardMoses, of California, Commissioners to the Philippine Islands to continueand perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil governmentalready commenced by the military authorities, subject in all respects toany laws which Congress may hereafter enact.The Commissioners named will meet and act as a board, and the Hon. WilliamH. Taft t is designated as president of the board. It is probable that thetransfer of authority from military commanders to civil officers will begradual and will occupy a considerable period. Its successfulaccomplishment and the maintenance of peace and order in the meantime willrequire the most perfect co operation between the civil and militaryauthorities in the islands, and both should be directed during thetransition period by the same Executive Department. The Commission willtherefore report to the Secretary of War, and all their action will besubject to your approval and control.You will instruct the Commission to proceed to the city of Manila, wherethey will make their principal office, and to communicate with the MilitaryGovernor of the Philippine Islands, whom you will at the same time directto render to them every assistance within his power in the performance oftheir duties. Without hampering them by too specific instructions, theyshould in general be enjoined, after making themselves familiar with theconditions and needs of the country, to devote their attention in the firstinstance to the establishment of municipal governments, in which thenatives of the islands, both in the cities and in the rural communities,shall be afforded the opportunity to manage their own local affairs to thefullest extent of which they are capable and subject to the least degree ofsupervision and control which a careful study of their capacities andobservation of the workings of native control show to be consistent withthe maintenance of law, order, and loyalty.The next subject in order of importance should be the organization ofgovernment in the larger administrative divisions corresponding tocounties, departments, or provinces, in which the common interests of manyor several municipalities falling within the same tribal lines, or the samenatural geographical limits, may best be subserved by a commonadministration. Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that thecondition of affairs in the islands is such that the central administrationmay safely be transferred from military to civil control they will reportthat conclusion to you, with their recommendations as to the form ofcentral government to be established for the purpose of taking over thecontrol.Beginning with the 1st day of September, 1900, the authority to exercise,subject to my approval, through the Secretary of War, that part of thepower of government in the Philippine Islands which is of a legislativenature is to be transferred from the Military Governor of the islands tothis Commission, to be thereafter exercised by them in the place and steadof the Military Governor, under such rules and regulations as you shallprescribe, until the establishment of the civil central government for theislands contemplated in the last foregoing paragraph, or until Congressshall otherwise provide. Exercise of this legislative authority willinclude the making of rules and orders, having the effect of law, for theraising of revenue by taxes, customs duties, and imposts; the appropriationand expenditure of public funds of the islands; the establishment of aneducational system throughout the islands; the establishment of a systemto secure an efficient civil service; the organization and establishment ofcourts; the organization and establishment of municipal and departmentalgovernments, and all other matters of a civil nature for which the MilitaryGovernor is now competent to provide by rules or orders of a legislativecharacter.The Commission will also have power during the same period to appoint tooffice such officers under the judicial, educational, and civil servicesystems and in the municipal and departmental governments as shall beprovided for. Until the complete transfer of control the Military Governorwill remain the chief executive head of the government of the islands, andwill exercise the executive authority now possessed by him and not hereinexpressly assigned to the Commission, subject, however, to the rules andorders enacted by the Commission in the exercise of the legislative powersconferred upon them. In the meantime the municipal and departmentalgovernments will continue to report to the Military Governor and be subjectto his administrative supervision and control, under your direction, butthat supervision and control will be confined within the narrowest limitsconsistent with the requirement that the powers of government in themunicipalities and departments shall be honestly and effectively exercisedand that law and order and individual freedom shall be maintained.All legislative rules and orders, establishments of government, andappointments to office by the Commission will take effect immediately, orat such times as they shall designate, subject to your approval and actionupon the coming in of the Commission\'s reports, which are to be made fromtime to time as their action is taken. Wherever civil governments areconstituted under the direction of the Commission such military posts,garrisons, and forces will be continued for the suppression of insurrectionand brigandage and the maintenance of law and order as the MilitaryCommander shall deem requisite, and the military forces shall be at alltimes subject, under his orders, to the call of the civil authorities forthe maintenance of law and order and the enforcement of their authority.In the establishment of municipal governments the Commission will take asthe basis of their work the governments established by the MilitaryGovernor under his order of August 8, 1899. and under the report of theboard constituted by the Military Governor by his order of January 29,1900, to formulate and report a plan of municipal government, of which HisHonor Cayetano Arellano, President of the Audiencia, was chairman, and theywill give to the conclusions of that board the weight and considerationwhich the high character and distinguished abilities of its membersjustify.In the constitution of departmental or provincial governments they willgive especial attention to the existing government of the island of Negros,constituted, with the approval of the people of that island, under theorder of the Military Governor of July 22, 1899, and after verifying, sofar as may be practicable, the reports of the successful working of thatgovernment they will be guided by the experience thus acquired so far as itmay be applicable to the condition existing in other portions of thePhilippines. They will avail themselves, to the fullest degree practicable,of the conclusions reached by the previous Commission to the Philippines.In the distribution of powers among the governments organized by theCommission, the presumption is always to be in favor of the smallersubdivision, so that all the powers which can properly be exercised by themunicipal government shall be vested in that government, and all the powersof a more general character which can be exercised by the departmentalgovernment shall be vested in that government, and so that in thegovernmental system, which is the result of the process, the centralgovernment of the islands, following the example of the distribution of thepowers between the States and the National Government of the United States,shall have no direct administration except of matters of purely generalconcern, and shall have only such supervision and control over localgovernments as may be necessary to secure and enforce faithful andefficient administration by local officers.The many Different degrees of civilization and varieties of custom andcapacity among the people of the different islands preclude very definiteinstruction as to the part which the people shall take in the selection oftheir own officers; but these general rules are to be observed: That in allcases the municipal officers, who administer the local affairs of thepeople, are to be selected by the people, and that wherever officers ofmore extended jurisdiction are to be selected in any way, natives of theislands are to be preferred, and if they can be found competent and willingto perform the duties, they are to receive the offices in preference to anyothers.It will be necessary to fill some offices for the present with Americanswhich after a time may well be filled by natives of the islands. As soon aspracticable a system for ascertaining the merit and fitness of candidatesfor civil office should be put in force. An indispensable qualification forall offices and positions of trust and authority in the islands must beabsolute and unconditional loyalty to the United States, and absolute andunhampered authority and power to remove and punish any officer deviatingfrom that standard must at all times be retained in the hands of thecentral authority of the islands.In all the forms of government and administrative provisions which they areauthorized to prescribe the Commission should bear in mind that thegovernment which they are establishing is designed not for oursatisfaction, or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for thehappiness, peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands,and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs, theirhabits, and even heir prejudices, to the fullest extent consistent with theaccomplishment of the Indispensable requisites of just and effectivegovernment.At the same time the Commission should bear in mind, and the people of theislands should be made plainly to understand, that there are certain greatprinciples of government which have been made the basis of our governmentalsystem which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance ofindividual freedom, and of which they have, unfortunately, been denied theexperience possessed by us; that there are also certain practical rules ofgovernment which we have found to be essential to the preservation of thesegreat principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and theserules of government must be established and maintained in their islands forthe sake of their liberty and happiness, however much they may conflictwith the customs or laws of procedure with which they are familiar.It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the Philippine Islandsfully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules, and theywill inevitably within a short time command universal assent. Upon everydivision and branch of the government of the Philippines, therefore, mustbe imposed these inviolable rules:That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without dueprocess of law; that private property shall not be taken for public usewithout just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accusedshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of thenature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnessesagainst him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in hisfavor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense; thatexcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, norcruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twicein jeopardy for the same offense, or be compelled in any criminal case tobe a witness against himself; that the right to be secure againstunreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; that neitherslavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except as a punishment forcrime; that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed; thatno law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, orthe rights of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the Governmentfor a redress of grievances; that no law shall be made respecting anestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, andthat the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worshipwithout discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.It will be the duty of the Commission to make a thorough investigation intothe titles to the large tracts of land held or claimed by individuals or byreligious orders; into the justice of the claims and complaints madeagainst such landholders by the people of the island or any part of thepeople, and to seek by wise and peaceable measures a just settlement of thecontroversies and redress of wrongs which have caused strife and bloodshedin the past. In the performance of this duty the Commission is enjoined tosee that no injustice is done; to have regard for substantial rights andequity, disregarding technicalities so far as substantial right permits,and to observe the following rules:That the provision of the Treaty of Paris pledging the United States to theprotection of all rights of property in the islands, and as well theprinciple of our own Government which prohibits the taking of privateproperty without due process of law, shall not be violated; that thewelfare of the people of the islands, which should be a paramountconsideration, shall be attained consistently with this rule of propertyright; that if it becomes necessary for the public interest of the peopleof the islands to dispose of claims to property which the Commission findsto be not lawfully acquired and held disposition shall be made thereof bydue legal procedure, in which there shall be full opportunity for fair andimpartial hearing and judgment; that if the same public interests requirethe extinguishment of property rights lawfully acquired and held duecompensation shall be made out of the public treasury therefore; that noform of religion and no minister of religion shall be forced upon anycommunity or upon any citizen of the islands; that, upon the other hand, nominister of religion shall be interfered with or molested in following hiscalling, and that the separation between State and Church shall be real,entire, and absolute.It will be the duty of the Commission to promote and extend, and, as theyfind occasion, to improve the system of education already inaugurated bythe military authorities. In doing this they should regard as of firstimportance the extension of a system of primary education which shall befree to all, and which shall tend to fit the people for the duties ofcitizenship and for the ordinary avocations of a civilized community. Thisinstruction should be given in the first instance in every part of theislands in the language of the people. In view of the great number oflanguages spoken by the different tribes, it is especially important to theprosperity of the islands that a common medium of communication may beestablished, and it is obviously desirable that this medium should be theEnglish language. Especial attention should be at once given to affordingfull opportunity to all the people of the islands to acquire the use of theEnglish language.It may be well that the main changes which should be made in the system oftaxation and in the body of the laws under which the people are governed,except such changes as have already been made by the military government,should be relegated to the civil government which is to be establishedunder the auspices of the Commission. It will, however, be the duty of theCommission to inquire diligently as to whether there are any furtherchanges which ought not to be delayed, and if so, they are authorized tomake such changes subject to your approval. In doing so they are to bear inmind that taxes which tend 6 penalize or repress industry and enterpriseare to be avoided; that provisions for taxation should be simple, so thatthey may be understood by the people; that they should affect the fewestpracticable subjects of taxation which will serve for the generaldistribution of the burden.The main body of the laws which regulate the rights and obligations of thepeople should be maintained with as little interference as possible.Changes made should be mainly in procedure, and in the criminal laws tosecure speedy and impartial trials, and at the same time effectiveadministration and respect for individual rights.In dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the islands the Commission shouldadopt the same course followed by Congress in permitting the tribes of ourNorth American Indians to maintain their tribal organization andgovernment, and under which many of those tribes are now living in peaceand contentment, surrounded by a civilization to which they are unable orunwilling to conform. Such tribal governments should, however, be subjectedto wise and firm regulation, and, without undue or petty interference,constant and active effort should be exercised to prevent barbarouspractices and introduce civilized customs.Upon all officers and employees of the United States, both civil andmilitary, should be impressed a sense of the duty to observe not merely thematerial but the personal and social rights of the people of the islands,and to treat them with the same courtesy and respect for their personaldignity which the people of the United States are accustomed W require fromeach other.The articles of capitulation of the city of Manila on the 13th of August,1898, concluded with these words:"This city, its inhabitants, its churches and religious worship, itseducational establishments, and its private property of all descriptions,are placed under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of theAmerican Army."I believe that this pledge has been faithfully kept. As high and sacred anobligation rests upon the Government of the United States to giveprotection for property and life, civil and religious freedom, and wise,firm, and unselfish guidance in the paths of peace and prosperity to allthe people of the Philippine Islands. I charge this Commission to labor forthe full performance of this obligation, which concerns the honor andconscience of their country, in the firm hope that through their labors allthe inhabitants of the Philippine Islands may come to look back withgratitude to the day when God gave victory to American arms at Manila andset their land under the sovereignty and the protection of the people ofthe United States.Coincidently with the entrance of the Commission upon its labors I causedto be issued by General MacArthur, the Military Governor of thePhilippines, on June 21, 1900, a proclamation of amnesty in generous terms,of which many of the insurgents took advantage, among them a number ofimportant leaders.This Commission, composed of eminent citizens representing the diversegeographical and political interests of the country, and bringing to theirtask the ripe fruits of long and intelligent service in educational,administrative, and judicial careers, made great progress from the outset.As early as August 21, 1900, it submitted a preliminary report, which willbe laid before the Congress, and from which it appears that already thegood effects of returning order are felt; that business, interrupted byhostilities, is improving as peace extends; that a larger area is undersugar cultivation than ever before; that the customs revenues are greaterthan at any time during the Spanish rule; that economy and efficiency inthe military administration have created a surplus fund of $6,000,000,available for needed public improvements; that a stringent civil servicelaw is in preparation; that railroad communications are expanding, openingup rich districts, and that a comprehensive scheme of education is beingorganized.Later reports from the Commission show yet more encouraging advance towardinsuring the benefits of liberty and good government to the Filipinos, inthe interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring,self supporting, and self administering community in those far easternseas. I would impress upon the Congress that whatever legislation may beenacted in respect to the Philippine Islands should be along these generouslines. The fortune of war has thrown upon this nation an unsought trustwhich should be unselfishly discharged, and devolved upon this Government amoral as well as material responsibility toward these millions whom we havefreed from an oppressive yoke.I have on another occasion called the Filipinos the wards of the nation.Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed; it must not beotherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit those whohave come under our fostering care. It is our duty so to treat them thatour flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and the fertilezones of Mindanao and Negros than it is at home, that there as here itshall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlightenment, and progress inevery avenue of development.The Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge He wouldbe rash who, with the teachings of contemporaneous history in view, wouldfix a limit to the degree of culture and advancement yet within the reachof these people if our duty toward them be faithfully performed.The civil government of Puerto Rico provided for by the act of the Congressapproved April 12, 1900 is in successful operation The courts have beenestablished. The Governor and his associates, working intelligently andharmoniously, are meeting with Commendable success.On the 6th of November a general election was held in the island formembers of the Legislature, and the body elected has been called to conveneon the first Monday of December.I recommend that legislation be enacted by the Congress conferring upon theSecretary of the Interior supervision over the public lands in Puerto Rico,and that he be directed to ascertain the location and quantity of lands thetitle to which remained in the Crown of Spain at the date of cession ofPuerto Rico to the United States, and that appropriations necessary forsurveys be made, and that the methods of the disposition of such lands beprescribed by law.On the 25th of July, 1900, I directed that a call be issued for an electionin Cuba for members of a constitutional convention to frame a constitutionas a basis for a stable and independent government in the island. Inpursuance thereof the Military Governor issued the following instructions:Whereas the Congress of the United States, by its joint resolution of April20, 1898, declared:"That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, freeand independent."That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention toexercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except forthe pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that isaccomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to itspeople;"And whereas, the people of Cuba have established municipal governments,deriving their authority from the suffrages of the people given under justand equal laws, and are now ready, in like manner, to proceed to theestablishment of a general government which shall assume and exercisesovereignty, jurisdiction, and control over the island:Therefore, it is ordered that a general election be held in the island ofCuba on the third Saturday of September, in the year nineteen hundred, toelect delegates to a convention to meet in the city of Havana at twelveo\'clock noon on the first Monday of November, in the year nineteen hundred,to frame and adopt a constitution for the people of Cuba, and as a partthereof to provide for and agree with the Government of the United Statesupon the relations to exist between that Government and the Government ofCuba, and to provide for the election by the people of officers under suchconstitution and the transfer of government to the officers so elected.The election will be held in the several voting precincts of the islandunder, and pursuant to, the provisions of the electoral law of April 18,1900, and the amendments thereof. The election was held on the 15th ofSeptember, and the convention assembled on the 5th of November, 1900, andis now in session.In calling the convention to order, the Military Governor of Cuba made thefollowing statement: As Military Governor of the island, representing thePresident of the United States, I call this convention to order.It will be your duty, first, to frame and adopt a constitution for Cuba,and when that has been done to formulate what in your opinion ought to bethe relations between Cuba and the United States.The constitution must be adequate to secure a stable, orderly, and freegovernment.When you have formulated the relations which in your opinion ought to existbetween Cuba and the United States the Government of the United States willdoubtless take such action on its part as shall lead to a final andauthoritative agreement between the people of the two countries to thepromotion of their common interests.All friends of Cuba will follow your deliberations with the deepestinterest, earnestly desiring that you shall reach just conclusions, andthat by the dignity, individual self restraint, and wise conservatism whichshall characterize your proceedings the capacity of the Cuban people forrepresentative government may be signally illustrated.The fundamental distinction between true representative government anddictatorship is that in the former every representative of the people, inwhatever office, confines himself strictly within the limits of his definedpowers. Without such restraint there can be no free constitutionalgovernment.Under the order pursuant to which you have been elected and convened youhave no duty and no authority to take part in the present government of theisland. Your powers are strictly limited by the terms of that order. Whenthe convention concludes its labors I will transmit to the Congress theconstitution as framed by the convention for its consideration and for suchaction as it may deem advisable.I renew the recommendation made in my special message of February 10, 1899,as to the necessity for cable communication between the United States andHawaii, with extension to Manila. Since then circumstances have strikinglyemphasized this need. Surveys have shown the entire feasibility of a chainof cables which at each stopping place shall touch on American territory,so that the system shall be under our own complete control. Manila oncewithin telegraphic reach, connection with the systems of the Asiatic coastwould open increased and profitable opportunities for a more direct cableroute from our shores to the Orient than is now afforded by thetrans Atlantic, continental, and trans Asian lines. I urge attention tothis important matter.The present strength of the Army is 100,000 men 65,000 regulars and35,000 volunteers. Under the act of March 2, 1899, on the 30th of June nextthe present volunteer force will be discharged and the Regular Army will bereduced to 2,447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.In 1888 a Board of Officers convened by President Cleveland adopted acomprehensive scheme of coast defense fortifications which involved theoutlay of something over one hundred million dollars. This plan receivedthe approval of the Congress, and since then regular appropriations havebeen made and the work of fortification has steadily progressed.More than sixty millions of dollars have been invested in a great number offorts and guns, with all the complicated and scientific machinery andelectrical appliances necessary for their use. The proper care of thisdefensive machinery requires men trained in its use. The number of mennecessary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the War Department,at a minimum allowance, to be 18,420.There are fifty eight or more military posts in the United States otherthan the coast defense fortifications.The number of these posts is being constantly increased by the Congress.More than $22,000,000 have been expended in building and equipment, andthey can only be cared for by the Regular Army. The posts now in existenceand others to be built provide for accommodations for, and if fullygarrisoned require, 26,000 troops. Many of these posts are along ourfrontier or at important strategic points, the occupation of which isnecessary.We have in Cuba between 5,000 and 6,000 troops. For the present our troopsin that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, and certainlynot until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention nowin session and a government provided by the new constitution shall havebeen established and its stability assured.In Puerto Rico we have reduced the garrisons to 1,636, which includes 879native troops. There is no room for further reduction here.We will be required to keep a considerable force in the Philippine Islandsfor some time to come. From the best information obtainable we will needthere for the immediate future from 45,000 to 60,000 men. I am sure thenumber may be reduced as the insurgents shall come to acknowledge theauthority of the United States, of which there are assuring indications.It must be apparent that we will require an army of about 60,000, and thatduring present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines the President shouldhave authority to increase the force to the present number of 100,000.Included in this number authority should be given to raise native troops inthe Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taft Commission believe will bemore effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas, assassins, andladrones than our own soldiers.The full discussion of this subject by the Secretary of War in his annualreport is called to your earnest attention.I renew the recommendation made in my last annual message that the Congressprovide a special medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars, sailors, andmarines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained in the serviceafter their terms of enlistment had expired.I favor the recommendation of the Secretary of War for the detail oilofficers from the line of the Army when vacancies occur in theAdjutant General\'s Department, Inspector General\'s Department,Quartermaster\'s Department, Subsistence Department, Pay Department,Ordnance Department, and Signal Corps.The Army cannot be too highly commended for its faithful and effectiveservice in active military operations in the field and the difficult workof civil administration.The continued and rapid growth of the postal service is a sure index of thegreat and increasing business activity of the country. Its most strikingnew development is the extension of rural free delivery. This has comealmost wholly within the last year. At the beginning of the fiscal year1899, 1900 the number of routes in operation was only 391, and most ofthese had been running less than twelve months. On the 15th of November,1900, the number had increased to 2,614, reaching into forty four Statesand Territories, and serving a population of 1,801,524. The number ofapplications now pending and awaiting action nearly equals all thosegranted up to the present time, and by the close of the current fiscal yearabout 4,000 routes will have been established, providing for the dailydelivery of mails at the scattered homes of about three and a half millionsof rural population.This service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces to goodroads, and quickens and extends the dissemination of general information.Experience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension that it would beso expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make it a serious burden.Its actual application has shown that it increases postal receipts, and canbe accompanied by reductions in other branches of the service, so that theaugmented revenues and the accomplished savings together materially reducethe net cost. The evidences which point to these conclusions are presentedin detail in the annual report of the Postmaster General, which with itsrecommendations is commended to the consideration of the Congress. The fulldevelopment of this special service, however, requires such a large outlayof money that it should be undertaken only after a careful study andthorough understanding of all that it involves.Very efficient service has been rendered by the Navy in connection with theinsurrection in the Philippines and the recent disturbance in China.A very satisfactory settlement has been made of the long pending questionof the manufacture of armor plate. A reasonable price has been secured andthe necessity for a Government armor plant avoided.I approve of the recommendations of the Secretary for new vessels and foradditional officers and men which the required increase of the Navy makesnecessary. I commend to the favorable action of the Congress the measurenow pending for the erection of a statue to the memory of the late AdmiralDavid D. Porter. I commend also the establishment of a national navalreserve and of the grade of vice admiral. Provision should be made, asrecommended by the Secretary, for suitable rewards for special merit. Manyofficers who rendered the most distinguished service during the recent warwith Spain have received in return no recognition from the Congress.The total area of public lands as given by the Secretary of the Interior isapproximately 1,071,881,662 acres, of which 917,135,880 acres areundisposed of and 154,745,782 acres have been reserved for variouspurposes. The public lands disposed of during the year amount to13,453,887.96 acres, including 62,423.09 acres of Indian lands, an increaseOf 4,271,474.80 over the preceding year. The total receipts from the saleof public lands during the fiscal year were $4,379,758.10, an increase of$1,309,620.76 over the preceding year.The results obtained from our forest policy have demonstrated its wisdomand the necessity in the interest of the public for its continuance andincreased appropriations by the Congress for the carrying on of the work.On June 30, 1900, there were thirty seven forest reserves, created byPresidential proclamations under section 24 Of the act of March 3, 1891,embracing an area Of 46,425,529 acres.During the past year the Olympic Reserve, in the State of Washington, wasreduced 265,040 acres, leaving its present area at 1,923,840 acres. ThePrescott Reserve, in Arizona, was increased from 10,240 acres to 423,680acres, and the Big Horn Reserve, in Wyoming, was increased from 1,127,680acres to 1,180,800 acres. A new reserve; the Santa Ynez, in California,embracing an area of 145,000 acres, was created during this year. OnOctober 10, 1900, the Crow Creek Forest Reserve, in Wyoming, was created,with an area of 56,320 acres.At the end of the fiscal year there were on the pension roll 993,529 names,a net increase Of 2,010 over the fiscal year 1899. The number added to therolls during the year was 45,344. The amount disbursed for Army pensionsduring the year was $134,700,597.24 and for Navy pensions $3,761,533.41, atotal of $138,462,130.65, leaving an unexpended balance of $5,542,768.25 tobe covered into the Treasury, which shows an increase over the previousyear\'s expenditure Of $107,077.70. There were 684 names added to the rollsduring the year by special acts passed at the first session of theFifty sixth Congress.The act of May 9, 1900, among other things provides for an extension ofincome to widows pensioned under said act to $250 per annum. The Secretaryof the Interior believes that by the operations of this act the number ofpersons pensioned under it will increase and the increased annual paymentfor pensions will be between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000.The Government justly appreciates the services of its soldiers and sailorsby making pension payments liberal beyond precedent to them, their widowsand orphans.There were 26,540 letters patent granted, including reissues and designs,during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1900; 1,660 trademarks, 682 labels,and 93 prints registered. The number of patents which expired was 19,988.The total receipts for patents were $1,358,228.35. The expenditures were$1,247,827.58, showing a surplus Of $110,400.77The attention of the Congress is called to the report of the Secretary ofthe Interior touching the necessity for the further establishment ofschools in the Territory of Alaska, and favorable action is invitedthereon.Much interesting information is given in the report of the Governor ofHawaii as to the progress and development of the islands during the periodfrom July 7, 1898, the date of the approval of the joint resolution of theCongress providing for their annexation, up to April 30, 1900, the date ofthe approval of the act providing a government for the Territory, andthereafter.The last Hawaiian census, taken in the year 1896, gives a total populationof 109,020, Of Which 31,019 were native Hawaiians. The number of Americansreported was 8,485. The results of the Federal census, taken this year,show the islands to have a total population Of 154,001, showing an increaseover that reported in 1896 of 44,981, or 41.2 per cent.There has been marked progress in the educational, agricultural, andrailroad development of the islands.In the Territorial act of April 30, 1900, section 7 of said act repealsChapter 34 Of the Civil Laws of Hawaii whereby the Government was to assistin encouraging and developing the agricultural resources of the Republic,especially irrigation. The Governor of Hawaii recommends legislationlooking to the development of such water supply as may exist on the publiclands, with a view of promoting land settlement. The earnest considerationof the Congress is invited to this important recommendation and others, asembodied in the report of the Secretary of the Interior.The Director of the Census states that the work in connection with theTwelfth Census is progressing favorably. This national undertaking, orderedby the Congress each decade, has finally resulted in the collection of anaggregation of statistical facts to determine the industrial growth of thecountry, its manufacturing and mechanical resources, its richness in minesand forests, the number of its agriculturists, their farms and products,its educational and religious opportunities, as well as questionspertaining to sociological conditions.The labors of the officials in charge of the Bureau indicate that the fourimportant and most desired subjects, namely, population, agricultural,manufacturing, and vital statistics, will be completed within the limitprescribed by the law of March 3, 1899.The field work incident to the above inquiries is now practically finished,and as a result the population of the States and Territories, including theHawaiian Islands and Alaska, has been announced. The growth of populationduring the last decade amounts to over 13,000,000, a greater numericalincrease than in any previous census in the history of the country.Bulletins will be issued as rapidly as possible giving the population byStates and Territories, by minor civil divisions. Several announcements ofthis kind have already been made, and it is hoped that the list will becompleted by January 1. Other bulletins giving the results of themanufacturing and agricultural inquiries will be given to the public asrapidly as circumstances will admit.The Director, while confident of his ability to complete the differentbranches of the undertaking in the allotted time, finds himself embarrassedby the lack of a trained force properly equipped for statistical work, thusraising the question whether in the interest of economy and a thoroughexecution of the census work there should not be retained in the Governmentemploy a certain number of experts not only to aid in the preliminaryorganization prior to the taking of the decennial census, but in additionto have the advantage in the field and office work of the Bureau of trainedassistants to facilitate the early completion of this enormousundertaking.I recommend that the Congress at its present session apportionrepresentation among the several States as provided by the Constitution.The Department of Agriculture has been extending its work during the pastyear, reaching farther for new varieties of seeds and plants; co operatingmore fully with the States and Territories in research along useful lines;making progress in meteorological work relating to lines of wirelesstelegraphy and forecasts for ocean going vessels; continuing inquiry as toanimal disease; looking into the extent and character of food adulteration;outlining plans for the care, preservation, and intelligent harvesting ofour woodlands; studying soils that producers may cultivate with betterknowledge of conditions, and helping to clothe desert places with grassessuitable to our and regions. Our island possessions are being consideredthat their peoples may be helped to produce the tropical products now soextensively brought into the United States. Inquiry into methods ofimproving our roads has been active during the year; help has been given tomany localities, and scientific investigation of material in the States andTerritories has been inaugurated. Irrigation problems in our semiaridregions are receiving careful and increased consideration.An extensive exhibit at Paris of the products of agriculture has made thepeoples of many countries more familiar with the varied products of ourfields and their comparative excellence.The collection of statistics regarding our crops is being improved andsources of information are being enlarged, to the end that producers mayhave the earliest advices regarding crop conditions. There has never been atime when those for whom it was established have shown more appreciation ofthe services of the Department.In my annual message of December 5, 1898, I called attention to thenecessity for some amendment of the alien contract law. There still remainimportant features of the rightful application of the eight hour law forthe benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration, and I againcommend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.That there may be secured the best service possible in the PhilippineIslands, I have issued, under date of November 30, 1900, the followingorder: The United States Civil Service Commission is directed to rendersuch assistance as may be practicable to the Civil Service Board, createdunder the act of the United States Philippine Commission, for theestablishment and maintenance of an honest and efficient civil service inthe Philippine Islands, and for that purpose to conduct examinations forthe civil service of the Philippine islands, upon the request of the CivilService Board of said islands, under such regulations as may be agreed uponby the said Board and the said United States Civil Service Commission. TheCivil Service Commission is greatly embarrassed in its work for want of anadequate permanent force for clerical and other assistance. Its needs arefully set forth in its report. I invite attention to the report, andespecially urge upon the Congress that this important bureau of the publicservice, which passes upon the qualifications and character of so large anumber of the officers and employees of the Government, should be supportedby all needed appropriations to secure promptness and efficiency.I am very much impressed with the statement made by the heads of all theDepartments of the urgent necessity of a hall of public records. In everydepartmental building in Washington, so far as I am informed, the space forofficial records is not only exhausted, but the walls of rooms are linedwith shelves, the middle floor space of many rooms is filled with thecases, and garrets and basements, which were never intended and areunfitted for their accommodation, are crowded with them. Aside from theinconvenience there is great danger, not only from fire, but from theweight of these records upon timbers not intended for their support. Thereshould be a separate building especially designed for the purpose ofreceiving and preserving the annually accumulating archives of the severalExecutive Departments. Such a hall need not be a costly structure, butshould be so arranged as to admit of enlargement from time to time. Iurgently recommend that the Congress take early action in this matter.I transmit to the Congress a resolution adopted at a recent meeting of theAmerican Bar Association concerning the proposed celebration of JohnMarshall Day, February 4, 1901. Fitting exercises have been arranged, andit is earnestly desired by the committee that the Congress may participatein this movement to honor the memory of the great jurist.The transfer of the Government to this city is a fact of great historicalinterest. Among the people there is a feeling of genuine pride in theCapital of the Republic.It is a matter of interest in this connection that in 1800 the populationof the District of Columbia was 14,093; to day it is 278,718. Thepopulation of the city of Washington was then 3,210; to day it is 218,196.The Congress having provided for "an appropriate national celebration ofthe Centennial Anniversary of the Establishment of the Seat of theGovernment in the District of Columbia," the committees authorized by ithave prepared a programme for the 12th of December, 1900, which date hasbeen selected as the anniversary day. Deep interest has been shown in thearrangements for the celebration by the members of the committees of theSenate and House of Representatives, the committee of Governors appointedby the President, and the committees appointed by the citizens andinhabitants of the District of Columbia generally. The programme, inaddition to a reception and other exercises at the Executive Mansion,provides commemorative exercises to be held jointly by the Senate and Houseof Representatives in the Hall of the House of Representatives, and areception in the evening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in honor of theGovernors of the States and Territories.In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it invites ofextravagance in Government expenditures and appropriations; and the chosenrepresentatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish an example intheir legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbandsfor the future. In this era of great business activity and opportunitycaution is not untimely. It will not abate, but strengthen, confidence. Itwill not retard, but promote, legitimate industrial and commercialexpansion. Our growing power brings with it temptations and perilsrequiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to inviteconflicts, nor for oppression, but for the more effective maintenance ofthose principles of equality and justice upon which our institutions andhappiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of ourGovernment is liberty; its superstructure peace.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity.On the sixth of September, President McKinley was shot by an anarchistwhile attending the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo, and died inthat city on the fourteenth of that month.Of the last seven elected Presidents, he is the third who has beenmurdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justifygrave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, thecircumstances of this, the third assassination of an AmericanPresident, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both PresidentLincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of typesunfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lincoln falling avictim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war, andPresident Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointedoffice seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depravedcriminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to allgovernments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popularliberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, andwho are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people\'s soberwill as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot.It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley\'sdeath he was the most widely loved man in all the United States; whilewe have never had any public man of his position who has been so whollyfree from the bitter animosities incident to public life. His politicalopponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generoustribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentlenessof character which so endeared him to his close associates. To astandard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tenderaffections and home virtues which are all important in the make up ofnational character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the Union,he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct inthe most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be nopersonal hatred of him, for he never acted with aught but considerationfor the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knewhim in public or private life. The defenders of those murderouscriminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it isexercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsiblepower. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot beurged.President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stocksprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belongedamong the wage workers, who had entered the Army as a private soldier.Wealth was not struck at when the President was assassinated, but thehonest toil which is content with moderate gains after a lifetime ofunremitting labor, largely in the service of the public. Still less waspower struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered inthe hands of any one individual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny orwealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage workerhas ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives of the systemof public rights and representative government who has ever risen topublic office. President McKinley filled that political office forwhich the entire people vote, and no President not even Lincolnhimself was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the wellthought out wishes of the people; his one anxiety in every crisis wasto keep in closest touch with the people to find out what they thoughtand to endeavor to give expression to their thought, after havingendeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been reelected tothe Presidency because the majority of our citizens, the majority ofour farmers and wage workers, believed that he had faithfully upheldtheir interests for four years. They felt themselves in close andintimate touch with him. They felt that he represented so well and sohonorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him tocontinue for another four years to represent them.And this was the man at whom the assassin struck That there might benothing lacking to complete the Judas like infamy of his act, he tookadvantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the peoplegenerally; and advancing as if to take the hand out stretched to him inkindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generousconfidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow.There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime.The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all whosaw the dark days, while the President yet hovered between life anddeath. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breathwent from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save offorgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of falteringtrust in the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory ofsuch a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride inwhat he had accomplished and in his own personal character, that wefeel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the Nation Wemourn a good and great President who is dead; but while we mourn we arelifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grandheroism with which he met his death.When we turn from the man to the Nation, the harm done is so great asto excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and mostresolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed bythe teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by thereckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press,appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy andsullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines,and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwindthat is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to theexploiter of sensationalism, and to the crude and foolish visionarywho, for whatever reason, apologizes for crime or excites aimlessdiscontent.The blow was aimed not at this President, but at all Presidents; atevery symbol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically theembodiment of the popular will of the Nation expressed through theforms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion theembodiment of the law abiding purpose and practice of the people of thetown. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the President beaccepted as due to protest against "inequalities in the social order,"save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting couldbe accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts amalefactor in jail. Anarchy is no more an expression of "socialdiscontent" than picking pockets or wife beating.The anarchist, and especially the anarchist in the United States, ismerely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because herepresents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man whoadvocates anarchy directly or indirectly, in any shape or fashion, orthe man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes himselfmorally accessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist is acriminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion andchaos to the most beneficent form of social order. His protest ofconcern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity; for ifthe political institutions of this country do not afford opportunity toevery honest and intelligent son of toil, then the door of hope isforever closed against him. The anarchist is everywhere not merely theenemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If everanarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but one red moment, tobe succeeded, for ages by the gloomy night of despotism.For the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices hisdoctrines, we need not have one particle more concern than for anyordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or politicalinjustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of hiscriminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evilconduct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by others or bythe State to do justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and nothingelse. He is in no sense, in no shape or way, a "product of socialconditions," save as a highwayman is "produced" by the fact than anunarmed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the greatand holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked insuch a cause. No man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrinesshould be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder ofsome specified private individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings, andmeetings are essentially seditious and treasonable.I earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its wisediscretion it should take into consideration the coming to this countryof anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to allgovernment and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Suchindividuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting toglorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and thelaw should ensure their rigorous punishment. They and those like themshould be kept out of this country; and if found here they should bepromptly deported to the country whence they came; and far reachingprovision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. Nomatter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress.The Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who killsor attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution orby law is in line of succession for the Presidency, while thepunishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to theenormity of the offense against our institutions.Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind shouldband against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense againstthe law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known asthe slave trade; for it is of far blacker infamy than either. It shouldbe so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treatieswould give to the Federal Government the power of dealing with thecrime.A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was affordedby the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just takenthe life of the President. The people would have torn him limb fromlimb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked inhis behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of thepeople against the Government, the Government was obliged at once toexert its full police power to save him from instant death at the handsof the people. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocationin our governmental system, and the danger of a recurrence of suchdeeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in thedirection of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order.No man will ever be restrained from becoming President by any fear asto his personal safety. If the risk to the President\'s life becamegreat, it would mean that the office would more and more come to befilled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and mercilessin dealing with every friend of disorder. This great country will notfall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a seriousmenace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, butwould involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizerwith their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but whentheir wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame.During the last five years business confidence has been restored, andthe nation is to be congratulated because of its present aboundingprosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, althoughit is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of theLord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdomis powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard usagainst the consequences of our own folly. The men who are idle orcredulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or handbut by gambling in any form, are always a source of menace not only tothemselves but to others. If the business world loses its head, itloses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of eachcitizen, and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens whichmakes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy,resolution, and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of thisindividual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and intelligentadministration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunityto work to good effect.The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went onwith ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenthcentury brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, withvery serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs whichhad almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient toregulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since theindustrial changes which have so enormously increased the productivepower of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than thegrowth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrialcenters has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate ofwealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially ofvery large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporatefortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmentalaction, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in othercountries as they operate in our own.The process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which iswholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grownricher the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before hasthe average man, the wage worker, the farmer, the small trader, been sowell off as in this country and at the present time. There have beenabuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it remains truethat a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated bythe person specially benefited only on condition of conferring immenseincidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the typewhich benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are suchas to offer great prizes as the rewards of success.The captains of industry who have driven the railway systems acrossthis continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed ourmanufactures, have on the whole done great good to our people. Withoutthem the material development of which we are so justly proud couldnever have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immenseimportance of this material development of leaving as unhampered as iscompatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whomthe success of business operations inevitably rests. The slighteststudy of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming ajudgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in abusiness operation; that the business ability of the man at the head ofany business concern, big or little, is usually the factor which fixesthe gulf between striking success and hopeless failure.An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to befound in the international commercial conditions of to day. The samebusiness conditions which have produced the great aggregations ofcorporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors ininternational Commercial competition. Business concerns which have thelargest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men arenaturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercialsupremacy among the nations of the world. America has only just begunto assume that commanding position in the international business worldwhich we believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmostimportance that this position be not jeoparded, especially at a timewhen the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and theskill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people makeforeign markets essential. Under such conditions it would be mostunwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation.Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike withignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitablyendangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our nationallife the rule which underlies all others is that, on the whole, andin the long run, we shall go up or down together. There are exceptions;and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times ofadversity, some will suffer far more, than others; but speakinggenerally, a period of good times means that all share more or less inthem, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater orless degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into anyproof of this statement; the memory of the lean years which began in1893 is still vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions inthis very year which is now closing. Disaster to great businessenterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top.It spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worstfor those farthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries;but the wage worker may be deprived of even bare necessities.The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care mustbe taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.Many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the greatindustrial combinations which are popularly, although with technicalinaccuracy, known as "trusts," appeal especially to hatred and fear.These are precisely the two emotions, particularly when combined withignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steadyjudgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of theworld shows that legislation will generally be both unwise andineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with soberself restraint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts wouldhave been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirelyineffective. In accordance with a well known sociological law, theignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend ofthe evils which he has been nominally opposing. In dealing withbusiness interests, for the Government to undertake by crude andill considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would beto incur the risk of such far reaching national disaster that it wouldbe preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand theimpossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces withwhich they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who wouldendeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are andto what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies.All this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and graveevils, one of the chief being over capitalization because of its manybaleful consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be madeto correct these evils.There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American peoplethat the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of theirfeatures and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springsfrom no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in thegreat industrial achievements that have placed this country at the headof the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not restupon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meetingchanging and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor uponignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort toaccomplish great things is necessary when the world\'s progress demandsthat great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction thatcombination and concentration should be, not prohibited, but supervisedand within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment thisconviction is right.It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract torequire that when men receive from Government the privilege of doingbusiness under corporate form, which frees them from individualresponsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprises thecapital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthfulrepresentations as to the value of the property in which the capital isto be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should beregulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the publicinjury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for socialbetterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid theentire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations existonly because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; andit is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmonywith these institutions.The first essential in determining how to deal with the greatindustrial combinations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In theinterest of the public, the Government should have the right to inspectand examine the workings of the great corporations engaged ininterstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can nowinvoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmentalregulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity hasbeen obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration.The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete knowledge whichmay be made public to the world.Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or otherassociations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence orprivileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, andfull and accurate information as to their operations should be madepublic regularly at reasonable intervals.The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in oneState, always do business in many States, often doing very littlebusiness in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lackof uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has anyexclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practiceproved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action.Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should,without interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself,also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporationsdoing an interstate business. This is especially true where thecorporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of somemonopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be nohardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in theircase it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it isprobable that supervision of corporations by the National Governmentneed not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercisedover them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts, in order toproduce excellent results.When the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenthcentury, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike inindustrial and political conditions, which were to take place by thebeginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as amatter of course that the several States were the proper authorities toregulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively insignificantand strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions arenow wholly different and wholly different action is called for. Ibelieve that a law can be framed which will enable the NationalGovernment to exercise control along the lines above indicated;profiting by the experience gained through the passage andadministration of the Interstate Commerce Act. If, however, thejudgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power topass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submittedto confer the power.There should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary ofCommerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the lastsession of the Congress. It should be his province to deal withcommerce in its broadest sense; including among many other thingswhatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great businesscorporations and our merchant marine.The course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive andfar reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose ofbroadening our markets, securing our business interests on a safebasis, and making firm our new position in the international industrialworld; while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage worker andcapitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity asbetween man and man in this Republic.With the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is ofsuch vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of thewage workers. If the farmer and the wage worker are well off, it isabsolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It istherefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wagesare higher to day in the United States than ever before in our history,and far higher than in any other country. The standard of living isalso higher than ever before. Every effort of legislator andadministrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this conditionof things and its improvement wherever possible. Not only must ourlabor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected sofar as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborersbrought over by contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet representa standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men inthe labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard it asnecessary, with this end in view, to re enact immediately the lawexcluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary inorder to make its enforcement entirely effective.The National Government should demand the highest quality of servicefrom its employees; and in return it should be a good employer. Ifpossible legislation should be passed, in connection with theInterstate Commerce Law, which will render effective the efforts ofdifferent States to do away with the competition of convict contractlabor in the open labor market. So far as practicable under theconditions of Government work, provision should be made to render theenforcement of the eight hour law easy and certain. In all industriescarried on directly or indirectly for the United States Governmentwomen and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor,from night work, and from work under unsanitary conditions. TheGovernment should provide in its contracts that all work should be doneunder "fair" conditions, and in addition to setting a high standardshould uphold it by proper inspection, extending if necessary to thesubcontractors. The Government should forbid all night work for womenand children, as well as excessive overtime. For the District ofColumbia a good factory law should be passed; and, as a powerfulindirect aid to such laws, provision should be made to turn theinhabited alleys, the existence of which is a reproach to our Capitalcity, into minor streets, where the inhabitants can live underconditions favorable to health and morals.American wage workers work with their heads as well as their hands.Moreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing; so that,independent of the reward, they wish to turn out a perfect job. This isthe great secret of our success in competition with the labor offoreign countries.The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter thewhole civilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for oneside the betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, in largecities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle offar reaching questions which we group together when we speak of"labor." The chief factor in the success of each man wage worker,farmer, and capitalist alike must ever be the sum total of his ownindividual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the powerof acting in combination or association with others. Very great goodhas been and will be accomplished by associations or unions ofwage workers, when managed with forethought, and when they combineinsistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for therights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is aduty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves.Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the Government inorder to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under ourConstitution there is much more scope for such action by the State andthe municipality than by the nation. But on points such as thosetouched on above the National Government can act.When all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as theindispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life forwhich we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so worksno outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also that heis indeed his brother\'s keeper, and that while no man who refuses towalk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else, yet thateach at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs to have thehelping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective, aid mustalways take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can allbest help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of commoninterest to all.Our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every honestand efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, everyimmigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, astout heart, a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his duty well inevery way and to bring up his children as law abiding and God fearingmembers of the community. But there should be a comprehensive lawenacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over ourpresent system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only allpersons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles ormembers of anarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a lowmoral tendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we shouldrequire a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigidsystem of examination at our immigration ports, the former beingespecially necessary.The second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure bya careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligentcapacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as Americancitizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of thembelong to the intelligent criminal class. But it would do what is alsoin point, that is, tend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so potent inproducing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order,out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally, allpersons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economicfitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with Americanlabor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn anAmerican living and enough money to insure a decent start underAmerican conditions. This would stop the influx of cheap labor, and theresulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness inAmerican industrial life; and it would dry up the springs of thepestilential social conditions in our great cities, where anarchisticorganizations have their greatest possibility of growth.Both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration lawshould be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic andsocial. A very close supervision should be exercised over the steamshipcompanies which mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should beheld to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law.There is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as anational policy. The first requisite to our prosperity is thecontinuity and stability of this economic policy. Nothing could be moreunwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by anygeneral tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertaintyare exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of ourcommercial and material well being. Our experience in the past hasshown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produceconditions closely approaching panic in the business world. Yet it isnot only possible, but eminently desirable, to combine with thestability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocalbenefit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is anincident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of ourpresent economic policy. It was specially provided for in the presenttariff law.Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our firstduty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every casewhere it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for sofar as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries.Just how far this is must be determined according to the individualcase, remembering always that every application of our tariff policy tomeet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinalfact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that willcover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. Thewell being of the wage worker is a prime consideration of our entirepolicy of economic legislation.Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to ourindustrial well being at home, the principle of reciprocity mustcommand our hearty support. The phenomenal growth of our export tradeemphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberalpolicy in dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty andvexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. Thecustomers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run,directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving ussomething in return. Their ability to purchase our products should asfar as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable usto take from them those products which we can use without harm to ourown industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefitto us.It is most important that we should maintain the high level of ourpresent prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development ofour interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets butto produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find marketsabroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in anycase where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection, orin any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is nolonger necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer inexchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other nationswhich are so desirable will naturally be promoted by the course thusrequired by our own interests.The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be inconnection with those of our productions which no longer require all ofthe support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and withthose others where either because of natural or of economic causes weare beyond the reach of successful competition.I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laidbefore it by my predecessor.The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call forimmediate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us asa Nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant incomparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms ofbusiness. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only atrifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships. Toremedy this state of things would not .merely serve to build up ourshipping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all who areinterested in the permanent establishment of a wider market forAmerican products, and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy.Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for theirterminal points. Shipping lines, if established to the principalcountries with which we have dealings, would be of political as well ascommercial benefit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the UnitedStates to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for thedistribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to carryAmerican goods in American built ships.At present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages whenput in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of thefast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, aresubsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike,cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have tomeet the fact that the original cost of building American ships isgreater than is the case abroad; that the wages paid American officersand seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamenof foreign competing countries; and that the standard of living on ourships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of ourcommercial rivals.Our Government should take such action as will remedy theseinequalities. The American merchant marine should be restored to theocean.The Act of March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally to establish gold asthe standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms ofmoney medium in use with us, has been shown to be timely and judicious.The price of our Government bonds in the world\'s market, when comparedwith the price of similar obligations issued by other nations, is aflattering tribute to our public credit. This condition it is evidentlydesirable to maintain.In many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient libertyfor the proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to beneed of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercialcrises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the countryshould be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade andcommerce.The collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue toexceed the ordinary expenditures of the Government, thanks mainly tothe reduced army expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not toreduce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit;but, after providing against any such contingency, means should beadopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit ofour actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secretary of theTreasury considers all these questions at length, and I ask yourattention to the report and recommendations.I call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures.The fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providingwhatever is actually necessary to our well being, should make us doublycareful to husband our national resources, as each of us husbands hisprivate resources, by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful orreckless expenditure. Only by avoidance of spending money on what isneedless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to thepoint required to meet our needs that are genuine.In 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstaterailways, commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinalprovisions of that act were that railway rates should be just andreasonable and that all shippers, localities, and commodities should beaccorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed withwhat were supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the provisionsof this act. That law was largely an experiment. Experience has shownthe wisdom of its purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some ofits requirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for theenforcement of its provisions are defective. Those who complain of themanagement of the railways allege that established rates are notmaintained; that rebates and similar devices are habitually resortedto; that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper;that they drive out of business the smaller competitor; that while manyrates are too low, many others are excessive; and that grosspreferences are made, affecting both localities and commodities. Uponthe other hand, the railways assert that the law by its very termstends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriersof that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary toestablish and maintain non discriminating rates.The act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its ratesshould be just to and open to all shippers alike. The Government shouldsee to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide aspeedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end. At the same timeit must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries throughwhich the commercial lifeblood of this Nation flows. Nothing could bemore foolish than the enactment of legislation which wouldunnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of thesecommercial agencies. The subject is one of great importance and callsfor the earnest attention of the Congress.The Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years hassteadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplishedresults of real value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade. It hasgone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of ourcountry and with two of the island groups that have lately come underour jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as alivelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits, andvegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in theseveral States and Territories where they may add materially to ourresources. By scientific attention to soil survey and possible newcrops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimentalshipments, to animal industry and applied chemistry, very practical aidhas been given our farming and stock growing interests. The products ofthe farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade duringthe year that has just closed.Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward ajust appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or ofnatural growth. The great part played by them in the creation andmaintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than everbefore.Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forestresources, whether of wood, water, or grass, from contributing theirfull share to the welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, givesthe assurance of larger and more certain supplies. The fundamental ideaof forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use. Forest protection isnot an end of itself; it is a means to increase and sustain theresources of our country and the industries which depend upon them. Thepreservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity. Wehave come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest, except tomake way for agriculture, threatens our well being.The practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining,grazing, irrigation, and other interests of the regions in which thereserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the Westfor their protection and extension. The forest reserves will inevitablybe of still greater use in the future than in the past. Additionsshould be made to them whenever practicable, and their usefulnessshould be increased by a thoroughly business like management.At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the GeneralLand Office, the mapping and description of their timber with theUnited States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for theirconservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also chargedwith the general advancement of practical forestry in the UnitedStates. These various functions should be united in the Bureau ofForestry, to which they properly belong. The present diffusion ofresponsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effectiveco operation between the Government and the men who utilize theresources of the reserves, without which the interests of both mustsuffer. The scientific bureaus generally should be put under theDepartment of Agriculture. The President should have by law the powerof transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the Department ofAgriculture. He already has such power in the case of lands needed bythe Departments of War and the Navy.The wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpfulto the interests which depend on water than to those which depend onwood and grass. The water supply itself depends upon the forest. In thearid region it is water, not land, which measures production. Thewestern half of the United States would sustain a population greaterthan that of our whole country to day if the waters that now run towaste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water problemsare perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States.Certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for thewild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protectedfrom fires. Many of them need special protection because of the greatinjury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer,elk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may beexpected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law andproperly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of surfacevegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds, includinggrouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have beenexterminated or driven away. At the same time the water storingcapacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus promotingfloods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams betweenrains.In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years,vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are comingback, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediateneighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Someat least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection tothe native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidlydiminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping groundsfor the ever increasing numbers of men and women who have learned tofind rest, health, and recreation in the splendid forests andflower clad meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be setapart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and notsacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few.The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in floodand replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of watersotherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protectthe storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservationis therefore an essential condition of water conservation.The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve thewaters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary toequalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Theirconstruction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vastfor private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individualStates acting alone. Far reaching interstate problems are involved; andthe resources of single States would often be inadequate. It isproperly a national function, at least in some of its features. It isas right for the National Government to make the streams and rivers ofthe arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as tomake useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineeringworks of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at theheadwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy ofriver control, under which levees are built on the lower reaches of thesame streams.The Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as itdoes other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow ofstreams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dryseason to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow.The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a differentproblem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. Theobject of the Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who willbuild homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be broughtwithin their reach.The pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes alongstreams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaimtheir holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain,however, vast areas of public land which can be made available forhomestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main line canalsimpracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works should bebuilt by the National Government. The lands reclaimed by them should bereserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the cost ofconstruction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed.The distribution of the water, the division of the streams amongirrigators, should be left to the settlers themselves in conformitywith State laws and without interference with those laws or with vestedfights. The policy of the National Government should be to aidirrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as willenable the people in the local communities to help themselves, and aswill stimulate needed reforms in the State laws and regulationsgoverning irrigation.The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich everyportion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio andMississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. Theincreased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrialproduction, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consumethe larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western competitionwith Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will beconsumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and otherindustries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Ourpeople as a whole will profit, for successful home making is butanother name for the upbuilding of the nation.The necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration ofthe policy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing toomuch, for a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what canand what cannot be safely attempted, by the early efforts, which mustof necessity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginningthe Government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt, its intentionto pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest. Noreservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal orlocal interests; but only in accordance with the advice of trainedexperts, after long investigation has shown the locality where all theconditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with thegreatest usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be noextravagance, and the believers in the need of irrigation will mostbenefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the leasttaint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys.Whatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation shouldharmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now livingon irrigated land. We are not at the starting point of thisdevelopment. Over two hundred millions of private capital has alreadybeen expended in the construction of irrigation works, and many millionacres of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and abilityhas been shown in the work itself; but as much cannot be said inreference to the laws relating thereto. The security and value of thehomes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water; butthe majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of courtdecisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditableexceptions, the arid States have failed to provide for the certain andjust division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain lawshave made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actualuses or necessities, and many streams have already passed into privateownership, or a control equivalent to ownership.Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it rendersproductive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart fromland cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition ofsuch ownership, which has been permitted to grow up in the aridregions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognitionof the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the publicwater supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humidregions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have noproper application in a dry country.In the arid States the only right to water which should be recognizedis that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the landreclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rightsto others than users, without compensation to the public, is open toall the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises tothe public utilities of cities. A few of the Western States havealready recognized this, and have incorporated in their constitutionsthe doctrine of perpetual State ownership of water.The benefits which have followed the unaided development of the pastjustify the nation\'s aid and co operation in the more difficult andimportant work yet to be accomplished. Laws so vitally affecting homesas those which control the water supply will only be effective whenthey have the sanction of the irrigators; reforms can only be final andsatisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the peoplemost concerned. The larger development which national aid insuresshould, however, awaken in every arid State the determination to makeits irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of anycountry in the civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise than forisolated communities to continue to learn everything experimentally,instead of profiting by what is already known elsewhere. We are dealingwith a new and momentous question, in the pregnant years whileinstitutions are forming, and what we do will affect not only thepresent but future generations.Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land andprovide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for thisnew industry the best possible social and industrial conditions; andthis requires that we not only understand the existing situation, butavail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution ofits problems. A careful study should be made, both by the Nation andthe States, of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad.Ultimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to co operatewith the several arid States in proportion as these States by theirlegislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it.In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditionalAmerican lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled bycheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men who themselvestill the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should beshaped with this end in view; the well being of the average home makermust afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands.The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on ourhomestead system.It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report asto Puerto Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continentallimits. The island is thriving as never before, and it is beingadministered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoyingliberty and order under the protection of the United States, and uponthis fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfaremust be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of anyother portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of freeaccess for their products to the markets of the United States. I askthe attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning thepublic lands of Puerto Rico.In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independentgovernment of the island upon a firm footing that before the presentsession of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cubawill then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of theAntilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend ourheartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed thequestion of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there areweighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policyshould be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly askyour attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of providingfor a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports intothe United States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what wedesired: that she should stand, in international matters, in closer andmore friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we arebound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercialmeasures in the interest of her material well being.In the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropicalislands, inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widelydifferent stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort isto help these people upward along the stony and difficult path thatleads to self government. We hope to make our administration of theislands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit tothe Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do, wepoint to what we have done. Already a greater measure of materialprosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attainedin the Philippines than ever before in their history.It is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualitieswithout which the institutions of free government are but an emptymockery. Our people are now successfully governing themselves, becausefor more than a thousand years they have been slowly fittingthemselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, toward thisend. What has taken us thirty generations to achieve, we cannot expectto have another race accomplish out of hand, especially when largeportions of that race start very far behind the point which ourancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with thePhilippine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearanceand steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do forthe islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples byeven the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what hasnever before been done for any people of the tropics to make them fitfor self government after the fashion of the really free nations.History may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which amasterful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies ofwar to take possession of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitantswith the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people haveshown in the Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would meanthat they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertionof duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. The character ofGovernor Taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof, ifsuch be needed, of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders aconstantly increasing measure of self government, exactly as fast asthey show themselves fit to exercise it. Since the civil government wasestablished not an appointment has been made in the islands with anyreference to considerations of political influence, or to aught elseSave the fitness of the man and the needs of the service.In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, may bethat here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them localself government. It is on this side that our error, if any, has beencommitted. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding out thefacts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives,can assert that we have not gone far enough. We have gone to the veryverge of safety in hastening the process. To have taken a single stepfarther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness, andmight well have been crime. We are extremely anxious that the nativesshall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious, first fortheir sakes, and next, because it relieves us of a great burden. Thereneed not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them allthe liberty for which they are fit.The only fear is test in our overanxiety we give them a degree ofindependence for which they are unfit, thereby inviting reaction anddisaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a givendistrict the people can govern themselves, self government has beengiven in that district. There is not a locality fitted forself government which has not received it. But it may well be that incertain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants showthemselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred.In other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing toshow a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in theopposite direction.There are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection hasbecome an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higherregard than the brigands of portions of the Old World. Encouragement,direct or indirect, to these insurrectors stands on the same footing asencouragement to hostile Indians in the days when we still had Indianwars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peacefulthe fullest and amplest consideration, but to have it understood thatwe will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we must make itevident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demandsof civilization and humanity, that while we will do everything in ourpower for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternestmeasures with the Filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto andthe ladrone.The heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of theislands for their steadfast loyalty. The Macabebes have beenconspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag. I recommendthat the Secretary of War be empowered to take some systematic actionin the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the serviceand the families of those who are killed.The time has come when there should be additional legislation for thePhilippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than tointroduce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much asthrowing them open to industrial development. The connection betweenidleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to doremunerative work is one of the surest preventatives of war. Of courseno business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to hisinterest to do so; and it is immensely to the interest of the islandsthat he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the Congressshould pass laws by which the resources of the islands can bedeveloped; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can begranted to companies doing business in them, and every encouragement begiven to the incoming of business men of every kind.Not to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchisesmust be granted and the business permitted only under regulations whichwill guarantee the islands against any kind of improper exploitation.But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and thecapital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity. The fieldmust be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the realfactor in the development of every region over which our flag hasflown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing withgeneral transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads, and theuse and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give freeplay to industrial enterprise; and the commercial development whichwill surely follow will accord to the people of the islands the bestproofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable toHawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines topoints in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary theconstruction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercialbut for political and military considerations.Either the Congress should immediately provide for the construction ofa Government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which likeadvantages to those accruing from a Government cable may be secured tothe Government by contract with a private cable company.No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on thiscontinent is of such consequence to the American people as the buildingof a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. Itsimportance to the Nation is by no means limited merely to its materialeffects upon our business prosperity; and yet with view to theseeffects alone it would be to the last degree important for usimmediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps bemost marked upon the Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South AtlanticStates, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It isemphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire countryto begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those greatworks which only a great nation can undertake with prospects ofsuccess, and which when done are not only permanent assets in thenation\'s material interests, but standing monuments to its constructiveability.I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on thissubject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit offriendliness and mutual good will and respect, have resulted in mybeing able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified willenable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, andwhich guarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked inconnection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton Bulwertreaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for theconstruction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, isabrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shalldo the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguardingthe canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms ofequality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nationfrom any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before theSenate, and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect tothe advantages it secures us by providing for the building of thecanal.The true end of every great and free people should be self respectingpeace; and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordialfriendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years,wars between the great civilized powers have become less and lessfrequent. Wars with barbarous or semi barbarous peoples come in anentirely different category, being merely a most regrettable butnecessary international police duty which must be performed for thesake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certaintywhere both sides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilizedpeoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining thatcondition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others whichwill in the end, as we hope and believe, make world wide peacepossible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression tothis hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment.This same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the MonroeDoctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference.The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreignpolicy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the UnitedStates. Just seventy eight years have passed since President Monroe inhis Annual Message announced that "The American continents arehenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization byany European power." In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is adeclaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by anynon American power at the expense of any American power on Americansoil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the OldWorld. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by oneNew World power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and along step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securingthe possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere.During the past century other influences have established thepermanence and independence of the smaller states of Europe. Throughthe Monroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independenceand secure like permanence for the lesser among the New World nations.This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of anyAmerican power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form suchas it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of thecommercial independence of the Americas. We do not ask under thisdoctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other Americanstate. We do not guarantee any state against punishment if itmisconducts itself, provided that punishment does not take the form ofthe acquisition of territory by any non American power.Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith. Wehave not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense ofany of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so thatall of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the goodfortune of any of them, we gladly hail their material prosperity andpolitical stability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fallinto industrial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any Old Worldmilitary power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to becomea military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosperbest if left to work out their own salvation in their own way.The work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued. No onepoint of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than thisto the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of ournation in the future. Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforthrecognize that we have international duties no less than internationalrights. Even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and PuertoRico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal, we shouldneed a thoroughly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be prepareddefinitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation isamong those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerceis always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war craft toprotect it.Inasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoningthe path upon which they have entered, and especially in view of thefact that the building of the Isthmian Canal is fast becoming one ofthe matters which the whole people are united in demanding, it isimperative that our Navy should be put and kept in the highest state ofefficiency, and should be made to answer to our growing needs. So farfrom being in any way a provocation to war, an adequate and highlytrained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest and mosteffective peace insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such anavy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which thisnation can possibly pay.Probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace aswe are. There is not a single civilized power which has anythingwhatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace;and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect forour rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend totheir rights in return, to insure fair treatment to us commercially,and to guarantee the safety of the American people.Our people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon itas the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere.The Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon theMonroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nationchooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right tothe just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to thecraven and the weakling.It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The shipsmust be built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliaryvessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of anybetter for the minor work, and a proportion of raw men can be mixedwith the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by theskill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the Navywhen pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusivelyin the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers andmen who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have beentrained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weaponswith the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships thatdealt the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched fromtwo to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did because themen in the conning towers, the gun turrets, and the engine rooms hadthrough long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty.Our present Navy was begun in 1882. At that period our Navy consistedof a collection of antiquated wooden ships, already almost as out ofplace against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades andHamilcar certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that timedid we have men fit to handle a modern man of war. Under the wiselegislation of the Congress and the successful administration of asuccession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy, belonging to bothpolitical parties, the work of upbuilding the Navy went on, and shipsequal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; andwhat was even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singlyand in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the bestpossible service out of them. The result was seen in the short war withSpain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitelygreater preparedness of our Navy than of the Spanish Navy.While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded andmanned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in thePhilippines and in Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed ofpraise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have beenstruck. The Congressmen who voted years in advance the money to laydown the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor plate; theDepartment officials and the business men and wage workers whofurnished what the Congress had authorized; the Secretaries of the Navywho asked for and expended the appropriations; and finally the officerswho, in fair weather and foul, on actual sea service, trained anddisciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war in sight allare entitled to a full share in the glory of Manila and Santiago, andthe respect accorded by every true American to those who wrought suchsignal triumph for our country. It was forethought and preparationwhich secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fail to showforethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disasterwill befall us instead of triumph; and should this time come, the faultwill rest primarily, not upon those whom the accident of events puts insupreme command at the moment, but upon those who have failed toprepare in advance.There should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy. So faringenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the greatwar craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas.It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additionalBattle ships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lightercraft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you tothe report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there is something we needeven more than additional ships, and this is additional officers andmen. To provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up, withthe expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed inactual war, would be worse than folly; it would be a crime against theNation.To send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard ithave been trained by years of actual sea service, including incessantgunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but thebitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen andone thousand additional marines should be provided; and an increase inthe officers should be provided by making a large addition to theclasses at Annapolis. There is one small matter which should bementioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaningtitle of "naval cadet" should be abolished; the title of "midshipman,"full of historic association, should be restored.Even in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, foronly so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The officersand men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water, for itis there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned.The big vessels should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merelybattle ships, but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts. Thetorpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manneras will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet theemergencies of actual warfare.Every detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be soperformed, the officer being kept for his special duty in the seaservice. Above all, gunnery practice should be unceasing. It isimportant to have our Navy of adequate size, but it is even moreimportant that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy inthe world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews andofficers, and this in turn imperatively demands continuous andprogressive instruction in target practice, ship handling, squadrontactics, and general discipline. Our ships must be assembled insquadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at anchor.The resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured; a battleship worn out in long training of officers and men is well paid for bythe results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how excellentcondition, it is useless if the crew be not expert.We now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for, of which nine arecompleted and have been commissioned for actual service. The remainingeight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take atleast that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is ofvast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by thetime they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply goodweapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men whoknow how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled undera thorough and well planned system of progressive instruction, whilethe recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Everyeffort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer thecommand of men. The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should beassigned to the combatant branches, the line and marines.Many of the essentials of success are already recognized by the GeneralBoard, which, as the central office of a growing staff, is movingsteadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of thewhole Navy, under the Secretary. This General Board, by fostering thecreation of a general staff, is providing for the official and then thegeneral recognition of our altered conditions as a Nation and of thetrue meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning is, first, the bestmen, and, second, the best ships.Messages and Papers of the Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, vol. 9,p.6667The Naval Militia forces are State organizations, and are trained forcoast service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner lineof defense. They should receive hearty encouragement from the GeneralGovernment.But in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval Reserve,organized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, andsubject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomesimminent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peaceestablishment, and offer material to be drawn on at once for manningour ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of theNaval Academy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews ofcoast line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels, and steamyachts, together with the coast population about such centers aslifesaving stations and light houses.The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy orelse make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position ininternational affairs, not merely in political, but in commercial,matters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courtingnational disaster than to be "opulent, aggressive, and unarmed."It is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present size atthis time. But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point ofefficiency. The individual units who as officers and enlisted mencompose this Army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least asefficient as those of any other army in the entire world. It is ourduty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highestpossible expression of power to these units when acting in combination.The conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavierdemand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity ofthe officer and the enlisted man, and to make it far more difficult formen to act together with effect. At present the fighting must be donein extended order, which means that each man must act for himself andat the same time act in combination with others with whom he is nolonger in the old fashioned elbow to elbow touch. Under such conditionsa few men of the highest excellence are worth more than many menwithout the special skill which is only found as the result of specialtraining applied to men of exceptional physique and morale. Butnowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult toperfect is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring rider.The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased. TheAmerican cavalryman, trained to manoeuvre and fight with equal facilityon foot and on horseback, is the best type of soldier for generalpurposes now to be found in the world. The ideal cavalryman of thepresent day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the bestinfantryman, and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care andmanagement of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback.A general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supplydepartments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men sodetailed returning after a while to their line duties. It is veryundesirable to have the senior grades of the Army composed of men whohave come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A systemshould be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by gradeof those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade.Justice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the Armywould seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be givenby law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy.The process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in amanner that would render it practically impossible to apply politicalor social pressure on behalf of any candidate, so that each man may bejudged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of civilofficials for political reasons is bad enough, but it is tenfold worsewhere applied on behalf of officers of the Army or Navy. Everypromotion and every detail under the War Department must be made solelywith regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit ofthe man himself. No pressure, political, social, or personal, of anykind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question ofpromotion or detail; and if there is reason to believe that suchpressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned, itwill be held to militate against him. In our Army we cannot afford tohave rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that thosewho by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them, and thatthose who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to performthem.Every effort should be made to bring the Army to a constantlyincreasing state of efficiency. When on actual service no work savethat directly in the line of such service should be required. The paperwork in the Army, as in the Navy, should be greatly reduced. What isneeded is proved power of command and capacity to work well in thefield. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in thetransportation and commissary departments.Our Army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult togive the higher officers (as well as the lower officers and theenlisted men) a chance to practice manoeuvres in mass and on acomparatively large scale. In time of need no amount of individualexcellence would avail against the paralysis which would followinability to work as a coherent whole, under skillful and daringleadership. The Congress should provide means whereby it will bepossible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars,and if possible also a division of national guardsmen, once a year.These exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres; or, if on theGulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic Seaboard, or in the region of theGreat Lakes, the army corps when assembled could be marched from someinland point to some point on the water, there embarked, disembarkedafter a couple of days\' journey at some other point, and again marchedinland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in masses whilethey are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking, will it bepossible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well andsmoothly.A great debt is owing from the public to the men of the Army and Navy.They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest pointof efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to anydemand made upon them to sustain the interests of the Nation and thehonor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is probably onthe whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any otherarmy. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return thehighest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is wellworth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlistedmen upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased tocorrespond with the increased value of the veteran soldier.Much good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army, passedearly in the present year. The three prime reforms, all of them ofliterally inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four yeardetails from the line for permanent appointments in the so called staffdivisions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with achief at the head; third, the establishment of a maximum and minimumlimit for the Army. It would be difficult to overestimate theimprovement in the efficiency of our Army which these three reforms aremaking, and have in part already effected.The reorganization provided for by the act has been substantiallyaccomplished. The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabledthe War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon ourrevenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring thisnumber much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit establishedby law. There is, however, need of supplementary legislation. Thoroughmilitary education must be provided, and in addition to the regularsthe advantages of this education should be given to the officers of theNational Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fitthemselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given thechance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of thisart. At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turnout men who are good in actual field service; too much stress shouldnot be laid on mathematics, nor should proficiency therein be held toestablish the right of entry to a corps d\'elite. The typical Americanofficer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician; but he mustbe able to master himself, to control others, and to show boldness andfertility of resource in every emergency.Action should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raisingof volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. Theorganization and armament of the National Guard of the several States,which are treated as militia in the appropriations by the Congress,should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces.The obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should becarefully defined, and a system established by law under which themethod of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed inadvance. It is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste ofimpending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have notbeen made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing inthe first volunteer organizations called out the training of thosecitizens who have already had experience under arms, and especially forthe selection in advance of the officers of any force which may beraised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible afterthe outbreak of war.That the Army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has beenshown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and PuertoRico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potentimplement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization.No other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans, thesurvivors of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed which ifleft undone would have meant that all else in our history went fornothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of ourhistory, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great experimentin popular freedom and self government a gloomy failure. Moreover, theynot only left us a united Nation, but they left us also as a heritagethe memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was kept united. Weare now indeed one Nation, one in fact as well as in name; we areunited in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of nationalgreatness and unity; and the very completeness of our union enables usall, in every part of the country, to glory in the valor shown alike bythe sons of the North and the sons of the South in the times that triedmen\'s souls.The men who in the last three years have done so well in the East andthe West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that thisremembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis the United States mustrely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldierywho do not make a permanent profession of the military career; andwhenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil Warwill give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to thosewhose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle.The merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democraticand American as the common school system itself. It simply means thatin clerical and other positions where the duties are entirelynon political, all applicants should have a fair field and no favor,each standing on his merits as he is able to show them by practicaltest. Written competitive examinations offer the only available meansin many cases for applying this system. In other cases, as wherelaborers are employed, a system of registration undoubtedly can bewidely extended. There are, of course, places where the writtencompetitive examination cannot be applied, and others where it offersby no means an ideal solution, but where under existing politicalconditions it is, though an imperfect means, yet the best present meansof getting satisfactory results.Wherever the conditions have permitted the application of the meritsystem in its fullest and widest sense, the gain to the Government hasbeen immense. The navy yards and postal service illustrate, probablybetter than any other branches of the Government, the great gain ineconomy, efficiency, and honesty due to the enforcement of thisprinciple.I recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classifiedservice to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable thePresident thus to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for thetemporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provisionthat they be selected under the Civil Service Law.It is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even moreimportant to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not anoffice should be filled in the Philippines or Puerto Rico with anyregard to the man\'s partisan affiliations or services, with any regardto the political, social, or personal influence which he may have athis command; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing savethe man\'s own character and capacity and the needs of the service.The administration of these islands should be as wholly free from thesuspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the Army andNavy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines orPuerto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in whichhe makes that country\'s rule a benefit to the peoples who have comeunder it. This is all that we should ask, and we cannot afford to becontent with less.The merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficientadministration of the Government; and in the long run the solejustification of any type of government lies in its proving itself bothhonest and efficient.The consular service is now organized under the provisions of a lawpassed in 1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions.The interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the countryin the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to yourattention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have inrecent years been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon thejust principle that appointments to the service should be made onlyafter a practical test of the applicant\'s fitness, that promotionsshould be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in theperformance of duty, and that the tenure of office should be unaffectedby partisan considerations.The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreigncommerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreigncountries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance ofthe dignity of the nation abroad, combine to make it essential that ourconsuls should be men of character, knowledge and enterprise. It istrue that the service is now, in the main, efficient, but a standard ofexcellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles setforth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on this subjectare enacted into law.In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make upour minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a memberof a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine tobreak up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and theindividual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians havealready become citizens of the United States. We should now break upthe tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the triballands; that is, they should be divided into individual holdings. Therewill be a transition period during which the funds will in many caseshave to be held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stopshould be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to leasetheir allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian worklike any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indiansshould be made the same as those of the whites.In the schools the education should be elementary and largelyindustrial. The need of higher education among the Indians is very,very limited. On the reservations care should be taken to try to suitthe teaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no use inattempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattleraising, where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The rationsystem, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, ishighly detrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuatespauperism, and stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier toprogress. It must continue to a greater or less degree as long astribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common. TheIndian should be treated as an individual like the white man. Duringthe change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every effortshould be made to minimize these hardships; but we should not becauseof them hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuousreduction in the number of agencies.In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important thanto preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradationresulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save ourown Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreementthis same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possessexclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about.I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people forthe St. Louis Exposition to commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversaryof the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance ofexpansion in our history. It definitely decided that we were to becomea great continental republic, by far the foremost power in the WesternHemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in ourhistory the great turning points in our development. It is eminentlyfitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will incommemorating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of allthe adjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making thecelebration a noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope thatforeign nations will appreciate the deep interest our country takes inthis Exposition, and our view of its importance from every standpoint,and that they will participate in securing its success. The NationalGovernment should be represented by a full and complete set ofexhibits.The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, arecarrying on an Exposition which will continue throughout most of thepresent session of the Congress. I heartily commend this Exposition tothe good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that canbe given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition have requestedthe Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits whichhave been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I havetaken the responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feelthat it is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. Inmy opinion the management should not be required to pay all theseexpenses. I earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at oncethe small sum necessary for this purpose.The Pan American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from theindustrial and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in ahigh degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo but to theUnited States. The terrible tragedy of the President\'s assassinationinterfered materially with its being a financial success. TheExposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our publicpolicy, because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch allthe peoples of the Western Hemisphere, and give them an increasingsense of unity. Such an effort was a genuine service to the entireAmerican public.The advancement of the highest interests of national science andlearning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable resultsof scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have beencommitted to the Smithsonian Institution. In furtherance of itsdeclared purpose for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge amongmen" the Congress has from time to time given it other importantfunctions. Such trusts have been executed by the Institution withnotable fidelity. There should be no halt in the work of theInstitution, in accordance with the plans which its Secretary haspresented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great NorthAmerican animals in the National Zoological Park. The urgent needs ofthe National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration ofthe Congress.Perhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fiftyyears is that which has created the modern public library and developedit into broad and active service. There are now over five thousandpublic libraries in the United States, the product of this period. Inaddition to accumulating material, they are also striving byorganization, by improvement in method, and by co operation, to givegreater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widelyuseful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process toreduce the cost of its administration.In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federallibrary, which, though still the Library of Congress, and so entitled,is the one national library of the United States. Already the largestsingle collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain toincrease more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange, andthe operation of the copyright law, this library has a uniqueopportunity to render to the libraries of this country to Americanscholarship service of the highest importance. It is housed in abuilding which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected forlibrary uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop thecollection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service necessaryto its effective use, render its bibliographic work widely available,and enable it to become, not merely a center of research, but the chieffactor in great co operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge andthe advancement of learning.For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancementof science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made apermanent Government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper, andmore satisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business but ofstatistic, economic, and social science.The remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact thatits revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubledwithin twelve years. Its progressive development compels constantlyincreasing outlay, but in this period of business energy and prosperityits receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annualdeficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 in 1897 to$3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the success of ruralfree delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actualexperience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for itsextension is general and urgent.It is just that the great agricultural population should share in theimprovement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operationis 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there are6,000 applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number inoperation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,600. Themail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our peoplewho have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one thirdof all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will becovered by this kind of service.The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has longbeen hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on theGovernment through the intrenched and well understood abuses which havegrown up in connection with second class mail matter. The extent ofthis burden appears when it is stated that while the second classmatter makes nearly three fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paidfor the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postalrevenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which producesthe large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress withthe purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information,were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actuallycontemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expensewould be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policydeliberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matterwhich enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of thelaw, and has secured admission only through an evasion of itsrequirements or through lax construction. The proportion of suchwrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one halfof the whole volume of second class mail. If it be only one third orone quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Post OfficeDepartment has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as ispossible by a stricter application of the law; and it should besustained in its effort.Owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on thePacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest nationalconcern to us.The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of theantiforeign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated in ajoint note addressed to China by the representatives of the injuredpowers in December last, were promptly accepted by the ChineseGovernment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of theseveral powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chineseplenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth themeasures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the jointnote, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laidbefore the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf ofthe United States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praiseis due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has displayed inperforming an exceptionally difficult and delicate task.The agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powersof the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially tobetter future relations between China and the powers. Reparation hasbeen made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising andpunishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in rank,recognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak.Official examinations have been forbidden for a period of five years inall cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated,and edicts have been issued making all officials directly responsiblefor the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violenceagainst them.Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreignrepresentatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use aquarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in whichthey can if necessary maintain permanent military guards; bydismantling the military works between the capital and the sea; and byallowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along thisline. An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting fortwo years the importation of arms and ammunition into China. China hasagreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states, societies, andindividuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses ofthe military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life andrestore order.Under the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China hasagreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to takesuch other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as theforeign powers may decide to be needed.The Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in thework of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, thecenters of foreign trade in central and northern China, and aninternational conservancy board, in which the Chinese Government islargely represented, has been provided for the improvement of theShanghai River and the control of its navigation. In the same line ofcommercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports hasbeen assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for advalorem duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of theUnited States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain freeof duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin andbullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement.During these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocatedmoderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustmentwhich tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a morebeneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world; whilein the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share insafe guarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating thenational interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths,doing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will, andleaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fairintercourse between China and the nations, on a footing of equal rightsand advantages to all. We advocate the "open door" with all that itimplies; not merely the procurement of enlarged commercialopportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by thewaterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored. Only bybringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly community oftrade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciouslybegun be carried to fruition. In the attainment of this purpose wenecessarily claim parity of treatment, under the conventions,throughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with those of allother powers.We view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results theproceedings of the Pan American Congress, convoked at the invitation ofMexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of theUnited States are under the most liberal instructions to cooperate withtheir colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great familyof American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselvesas in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with theworld at large.My predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil andLa Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courtsof our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on thepart of the claimants, and that in accordance with the acts of theCongress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of State onthese awards has been returned to Mexico. A considerable portion of themoney received from Mexico on these awards had been paid by thisGovernment to the claimants before the decision of the courts wasrendered. My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico anamount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants.The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deepand heartfelt sorrow, to which the Government gave full expression.When President McKinley died, our Nation in turn received from everyquarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no lesssincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany alsoaroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathywas cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President wasassassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world wereceived, at the time of the President\'s death, assurances of suchgrief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people. In the midst ofour affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that we are at peacewith the nations of mankind; and we firmly intend that our policy shallbe such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutualrespect and good will.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:We still continue in a period of unbounded prosperity. This prosperityis not the creature of law, but undoubtedly the laws under which wework have been instrumental in creating the conditions which made itpossible, and by unwise legislation it would be easy enough to destroyit. There will undoubtedly be periods of depression. The wave willrecede; but the tide will advance. This Nation is seated on a continentflanked by two great oceans. It is composed of men the descendants ofpioneers, or, in a sense, pioneers themselves; of men winnowed out fromamong the nations of the Old World by the energy, boldness, and love ofadventure found in their own eager hearts. Such a Nation, so placed,will surely wrest success from fortune.As a people we have played a large part in the world, and we are bentupon making our future even larger than the past. In particular, theevents of the last four years have definitely decided that, for woe orfor weal, our place must be great among the nations. We may either fallgreatly or succeed greatly; but we can not avoid the endeavor fromwhich either great failure or great success must come. Even if wewould, we can not play a small part. If we should try, all that wouldfollow would be that we should play a large part ignobly andshamefully.But our people, the sons of the men of the Civil War, the sons of themen who had iron in their blood, rejoice in the present and face thefuture high of heart and resolute of will. Ours is not the creed of theweakling and the coward; ours is the gospel of hope and of triumphantendeavor. We do not shrink from the struggle before us. There are manyproblems for us to face at the outset of the twentieth century graveproblems abroad and still graver at home; but we know that we can solvethem and solve them well, provided only that we bring to the solutionthe qualities of head and heart which were shown by the men who, in thedays of Washington, rounded this Government, and, in the days ofLincoln, preserved it.No country has ever occupied a higher plane of material well being thanours at the present moment. This well being is due to no sudden oraccidental causes, but to the play of the economic forces in thiscountry for over a century; to our laws, our sustained and continuouspolicies; above all, to the high individual average of our citizenship.Great fortunes have been won by those who have taken the lead in thisphenomenal industrial development, and most of these fortunes have beenwon not by doing evil, but as an incident to action which has benefitedthe community as a whole. Never before has material well being been sowidely diffused among our people. Great fortunes have been accumulated,and yet in the aggregate these fortunes are small Indeed when comparedto the wealth of the people as a whole. The plain people are better offthan they have ever been before. The insurance companies, which arepractically mutual benefit societies especially helpful to men ofmoderate means represent accumulations of capital which are among thelargest in this country. There are more deposits in the savings banks,more owners of farms, more well paid wage workers in this country nowthan ever before in our history. Of course, when the conditions havefavored the growth of so much that was good, they have also favoredsomewhat the growth of what was evil. It is eminently necessary that weshould endeavor to cut out this evil, but let us keep a due sense ofproportion; let us not in fixing our gaze upon the lesser evil forgetthe greater good. The evils are real and some of them are menacing, butthey are the outgrowth, not of misery or decadence, but ofprosperity of the progress of our gigantic industrial development.This industrial development must not be checked, but side by side withit should go such progressive regulation as will diminish the evils. Weshould fail in our duty if we did not try to remedy the evils, but weshall succeed only if we proceed patiently, with practical common senseas well as resolution, separating the good from the bad and holding onto the former while endeavoring to get rid of the latter.In my Message to the present Congress at its first session I discussedat length the question of the regulation of those big corporationscommonly doing an interstate business, often with some tendency tomonopoly, which are popularly known as trusts. The experience of thepast year has emphasized, in my opinion, the desirability of the stepsI then proposed. A fundamental requisite of social efficiency is a highstandard of individual energy and excellence; but this is in no wiseinconsistent with power to act in combination for aims which can not sowell be achieved by the individual acting alone. A fundamental base ofcivilization is the inviolability of property; but this is in no wiseinconsistent with the right of society to regulate the exercise of theartificial powers which it confers upon the owners of property, underthe name of corporate franchises, in such a way as to prevent themisuse of these powers. Corporations, and especially combinations ofcorporations, should be managed under public regulation. Experience hasshown that under our system of government the necessary supervision cannot be obtained by State action. It must therefore be achieved bynational action. Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on thecontrary, these big aggregations are an inevitable development ofmodern industrialism, and the effort to destroy them would be futileunless accomplished in ways that would work the utmost mischief to theentire body politic. We can do nothing of good in the way of regulatingand supervising these corporations until we fix clearly in our mindsthat we are not attacking the corporations, but endeavoring to do awaywith any evil in them. We are not hostile to them; we are merelydetermined that they shall be so handled as to subserve the publicgood. We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth. Thecapitalist who, alone or in conjunction with his fellows, performs somegreat industrial feat by which he wins money is a welldoer, not awrongdoer, provided only he works in proper and legitimate lines. Wewish to favor such a man when he does well. We wish to supervise andcontrol his actions only to prevent him from doing ill. Publicity cando no harm to the honest corporation; and we need not be over tenderabout sparing the dishonest corporation.  In curbing and regulating thecombinations of capital which are, or may become, injurious to thepublic we must be careful not to stop the great enterprises which havelegitimately reduced the cost of production, not to abandon the placewhich our country has won in the leadership of the internationalindustrial world, not to strike down wealth with the result of closingfactories and mines, of turning the wage worker idle in the streets andleaving the farmer without a market for what he grows. Insistence uponthe impossible means delay in achieving the possible, exactly as, onthe other hand, the stubborn defense alike of what is good and what isbad in the existing system, the resolute effort to obstruct any attemptat betterment, betrays blindness to the historic truth that wiseevolution is the sure safeguard against revolution.No more important subject can come before the Congress than this of theregulation of interstate business. This country can not afford to sitsupine on the plea that under our peculiar system of government we arehelpless in the presence of the new conditions, and unable to grapplewith them or to cut out whatever of evil has arisen in connection withthem. The power of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce is anabsolute and unqualified grant, and without limitations other thanthose prescribed by the Constitution. The Congress has constitutionalauthority to make all laws necessary and proper for executing thispower, and I am satisfied that this power has not been exhausted by anylegislation now on the statute books. It is evident, therefore, thatevils restrictive of commercial freedom and entailing restraint uponnational commerce fall within the regulative power of the Congress, andthat a wise and reasonable law would be a necessary and proper exerciseof Congressional authority to the end that such evils should beeradicated.I believe that monopolies, unjust discriminations, which prevent orcripple competition, fraudulent overcapitalization, and other evils intrust organizations and practices which injuriously affect interstatetrade can be prevented under the power of the Congress to "regulatecommerce with foreign nations and among the several States" throughregulations and requirements operating directly upon such commerce, theinstrumentalities thereof, and those engaged therein.I earnestly recommend this subject to the consideration of the Congresswith a view to the passage of a law reasonable in its provisions andeffective in its operations, upon which the questions can be finallyadjudicated that now raise doubts as to the necessity of constitutionalamendment. If it prove impossible to accomplish the purposes above setforth by such a law, then, assuredly, we should not shrink fromamending the Constitution so as to secure beyond peradventure the powersought.The Congress has not heretofore made any appropriation for the betterenforcement of the antitrust law as it now stands. Very much has beendone by the Department of Justice in securing the enforcement of thislaw, but much more could be done if the Congress would make a specialappropriation for this purpose, to be expended under the direction ofthe Attorney General.One proposition advocated has been the reduction of the tariff as ameans of reaching the evils of the trusts which fall within thecategory I have described. Not merely would this be wholly ineffective,but the diversion of our efforts in such a direction would mean theabandonment of all intelligent attempt to do away with these evils.Many of the largest corporations, many of those which should certainlybe included in any proper scheme of regulation, would not be affectedin the slightest degree by a change in the tariff, save as such changeinterfered with the general prosperity of the country. The onlyrelation of the tariff to big corporations as a whole is that thetariff makes manufactures profitable, and the tariff remedy proposedwould be in effect simply to make manufactures unprofitable. To removethe tariff as a punitive measure directed against trusts wouldinevitably result in ruin to the weaker competitors who are strugglingagainst them. Our aim should be not by unwise tariff changes to giveforeign products the advantage over domestic products, but by properregulation to give domestic competition a fair chance; and this end cannot be reached by any tariff changes which would affect unfavorably alldomestic competitors, good and bad alike. The question of regulation ofthe trusts stands apart from the question of tariff revision.Stability of economic policy must always be the prime economic need ofthis country. This stability should not be fossilization. The countryhas acquiesced in the wisdom of the protective tariff principle. It isexceedingly undesirable that this system should be destroyed or thatthere should be violent and radical changes therein. Our pastexperience shows that great prosperity in this country has always comeunder a protective tariff; and that the country can not prosper underfitful tariff changes at short intervals. Moreover, if the tariff lawsas a whole work well, and if business has prospered under them and isprospering, it is better to endure for a time slight inconveniences andinequalities in some schedules than to upset business by too quick andtoo radical changes. It is most earnestly to be wished that we couldtreat the tariff from the standpoint solely of our business needs. Itis, perhaps, too much to hope that partisanship may be entirelyexcluded from consideration of the subject, but at least it can be madesecondary to the business interests of the country that is, to theinterests of our people as a whole. Unquestionably these businessinterests will best be served if together with fixity of principle asregards the tariff we combine a system which will permit us from timeto time to make the necessary reapplication of the principle to theshifting national needs. We must take scrupulous care that thereapplication shall be made in such a way that it will not amount to adislocation of our system, the mere threat of which (not to speak ofthe performance) would produce paralysis in the business energies ofthe community. The first consideration in making these changes would,of course, be to preserve the principle which underlies our wholetariff system that is, the principle of putting American businessinterests at least on a full equality with interests abroad, and ofalways allowing a sufficient rate of duty to more than cover thedifference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being ofthe wage worker, like the well being of the tiller of the soil, shouldbe treated as an essential in shaping our whole economic policy. Theremust never be any change which will jeopardize the standard of comfort,the standard of wages of the American wage worker.One way in which the readjustment sought can be reached is byreciprocity treaties. It is greatly to be desired that such treatiesmay be adopted. They can be used to widen our markets and to give agreater field for the activities of our producers on the one hand, andon the other hand to secure in practical shape the lowering of dutieswhen they are no longer needed for protection among our own people, orwhen the minimum of damage done may be disregarded for the sake of themaximum of good accomplished. If it prove impossible to ratify thepending treaties, and if there seem to be no warrant for the endeavorto execute others, or to amend the pending treaties so that they can beratified, then the same end to secure reciprocity should be met bydirect legislation.Wherever the tariff conditions are such that a needed change can notwith advantage be made by the application of the reciprocity idea, thenit can be made outright by a lowering of duties on a given product. Ifpossible, such change should be made only after the fullestconsideration by practical experts, who should approach the subjectfrom a business standpoint, having in view both the particularinterests affected and the commercial well being of the people as awhole. The machinery for providing such careful investigation canreadily be supplied. The executive department has already at itsdisposal methods of collecting facts and figures; and if the Congressdesires additional consideration to that which will be given thesubject by its own committees, then a commission of business expertscan be appointed whose duty it should be to recommend action by theCongress after a deliberate and scientific examination of the variousschedules as they are affected by the changed and changing conditions.The unhurried and unbiased report of this commission would show whatchanges should be made in the various schedules, and how far thesechanges could go without also changing the great prosperity which thiscountry is now enjoying, or upsetting its fixed economic policy.The cases in which the tariff can produce a monopoly are so few as toconstitute an inconsiderable factor in the question; but of course ifin any case it be found that a given rate of duty does promote amonopoly which works ill, no protectionist would object to suchreduction of the duty as would equalize competition.In my judgment, the tariff on anthracite coal should be removed, andanthracite put actually, where it now is nominally, on the free list.This would have no effect at all save in crises; but in crises it mightbe of service to the people.Interest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in orderthat these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs of theseasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent therecurrence of financial stringencies which injuriously affectlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element ofelasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants ofcommerce, and upon them should be placed, as far as practicable, theburden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to supplythe needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic and foreigncommerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated that asufficient supply should be always available for the business interestsof the country.It would be both unwise and unnecessary at this time to attempt toreconstruct our financial system, which has been the growth of acentury; but some additional legislation is, I think, desirable. Themere outline of any plan sufficiently comprehensive to meet theserequirements would transgress the appropriate limits of thiscommunication. It is suggested, however, that all future legislation onthe subject should be with the view of encouraging the use of suchinstrumentalities as will automatically supply every legitimate demandof productive industries and of commerce, not only in the amount, butin the character of circulation; and of making all kinds of moneyinterchangeable, and, at the will of the holder, convertible into theestablished gold standard.I again call your attention to the need of passing a proper immigrationlaw, covering the points outlined in my Message to you at the firstsession of the present Congress; substantially such a bill has alreadypassed the House.How to secure fair treatment alike for labor and for capital, how tohold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or employee,without weakening individual initiative, without hampering and crampingthe industrial development of the country, is a problem fraught withgreat difficulties and one which it is of the highest importance tosolve on lines of sanity and far sighted common sense as well as ofdevotion to the right. This is an era of federation and combination.Exactly as business men find they must often work through corporations,and as it is a constant tendency of these corporations to grow larger,so it is often necessary for laboring men to work in federations, andthese have become important factors of modern industrial life. Bothkinds of federation, capitalistic and labor, can do much good, and as anecessary corollary they can both do evil. Opposition to each kind oforganization should take the form of opposition to whatever is bad inthe conduct of any given corporation or union not of attacks uponcorporations as such nor upon unions as such; for some of the mostfar reaching beneficent work for our people has been accomplishedthrough both corporations and unions. Each must refrain from arbitraryor tyrannous interference with the rights of others. Organized capitaland organized labor alike should remember that in the long run theinterest of each must be brought into harmony with the interest of thegeneral public; and the conduct of each must conform to the fundamentalrules of obedience to the law, of individual freedom, and of justiceand fair dealing toward all. Each should remember that in addition topower it must strive after the realization of healthy, lofty, andgenerous ideals. Every employer, every wage worker, must be guaranteedhis liberty and his right to do as he likes with his property or hislabor so long as he does not infringe upon the rights of others. It isof the highest importance that employer and employee alike shouldendeavor to appreciate each the viewpoint of the other and the suredisaster that will come upon both in the long run if either grows totake as habitual an attitude of sour hostility and distrust toward theother. Few people deserve better of the country than thoserepresentatives both of capital and labor and there are many such whowork continually to bring about a good understanding of this kind,based upon wisdom and upon broad and kindly sympathy between employersand employed. Above all, we need to remember that any kind of classanimosity in the political world is, if possible, even more wicked,even more destructive to national welfare, than sectional, race, orreligious animosity. We can get good government only upon conditionthat we keep true to the principles upon which this Nation was founded,and judge each man not as a part of a class, but upon his individualmerits. All that we have a right to ask of any man, rich or poor,whatever his creed, his occupation, his birthplace, or his residence,is that he shall act well and honorably by his neighbor and by, hiscountry. We are neither for the rich man as such nor for the poor manas such; we are for the upright man, rich or poor. So far as theconstitutional powers of the National Government touch these matters ofgeneral and vital moment to the Nation, they should be exercised inconformity with the principles above set forth.It is earnestly hoped that a secretary of commerce may be created, witha seat in the Cabinet. The rapid multiplication of questions affectinglabor and capital, the growth and complexity of the organizationsthrough which both labor and capital now find expression, the steadytendency toward the employment of capital in huge corporations, and thewonderful strides of this country toward leadership in theinternational business world justify an urgent demand for the creationof such a position. Substantially all the leading commercial bodies inthis country have united in requesting its creation. It is desirablethat some such measure as that which has already passed the Senate beenacted into law. The creation of such a department would in itself bean advance toward dealing with and exercising supervision over thewhole subject of the great corporations doing an interstate business;and with this end in view, the Congress should endow the departmentwith large powers, which could be increased as experience might showthe need.I hope soon to submit to the Senate a reciprocity treaty with Cuba. OnMay 20 last the United States kept its promise to the island byformally vacating Cuban soil and turning Cuba over to those whom herown people had chosen as the first officials of the new Republic.Cuba lies at our doors, and whatever affects her for good or for illaffects us also. So much have our people felt this that in the Plattamendment we definitely took the ground that Cuba must hereafter havecloser political relations with us than with any other power. Thus in asense Cuba has become a part of our international political system.This makes it necessary that in return she should be given some of thebenefits of becoming part of our economic system. It is, from our ownstandpoint, a short sighted and mischievous policy to fail to recognizethis need. Moreover, it is unworthy of a mighty and generous nation,itself the greatest and most successful republic in history, to refuseto stretch out a helping hand to a young and weak sister republic justentering upon its career of independence. We should always fearlesslyinsist upon our rights in the face of the strong, and we should withungrudging hand do our generous duty by the weak. I urge the adoptionof reciprocity with Cuba not only because it is eminently for our owninterests to control the Cuban market and by every means to foster oursupremacy in the tropical lands and waters south of us, but alsobecause we, of the giant republic of the north, should make all oursister nations of the American Continent feel that whenever they willpermit it we desire to show ourselves disinterestedly and effectivelytheir friend.A convention with Great Britain has been concluded, which will be atonce laid before the Senate for ratification, providing for reciprocaltrade arrangements between the United States and Newfoundland onsubstantially the lines of the convention formerly negotiated by theSecretary of State, Mr. Blaine. I believe reciprocal trade relationswill be greatly to the advantage of both countries.As civilization grows warfare becomes less and less the normalcondition of foreign relations. The last century has seen a markeddiminution of wars between civilized powers; wars with uncivilizedpowers are largely mere matters of international police duty, essentialfor the welfare of the world. Wherever possible, arbitration or somesimilar method should be employed in lieu of war to settle difficultiesbetween civilized nations, although as yet the world has not progressedsufficiently to render it possible, or necessarily desirable, to invokearbitration in every case. The formation of the international tribunalwhich sits at The Hague is an event of good omen from which greatconsequences for the welfare of all mankind may flow. It is far better,where possible, to invoke such a permanent tribunal than to createspecial arbitrators for a given purpose.It is a matter of sincere congratulation to our country that the UnitedStates and Mexico should have been the first to use the good offices ofThe Hague Court. This was done last summer with most satisfactoryresults in the case of a claim at issue between us and our sisterRepublic. It is earnestly to be hoped that this first case will serveas a precedent for others, in which not only the United States butforeign nations may take advantage of the machinery already inexistence at The Hague.I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the Hawaiianfire claims, which were the subject of careful investigation during thelast session.The Congress has wisely provided that we shall build at once anisthmian canal, if possible at Panama. The Attorney General reportsthat we can undoubtedly acquire good title from the French Panama CanalCompany. Negotiations are now pending with Colombia to secure herassent to our building the canal. This canal will be one of thegreatest engineering feats of the twentieth century; a greaterengineering feat than has yet been accomplished during the history ofmankind. The work should be carried out as a continuing policy withoutregard to change of Administration; and it should be begun undercircumstances which will make it a matter of pride for allAdministrations to continue the policy.The canal will be of great benefit to America, and of importance to allthe world. It will be of advantage to us industrially and also asimproving our military position. It will be of advantage to thecountries of tropical America. It is earnestly to be hoped that all ofthese countries will do as some of them have already done with signalsuccess, and will invite to their shores commerce and improve theirmaterial conditions by recognizing that stability and order are theprerequisites of successful development. No independent nation inAmerica need have the slightest fear of aggression from the UnitedStates. It behoves each one to maintain order within its own bordersand to discharge its just obligations to foreigners. When this is done,they can rest assured that, be they strong or weak, they have nothingto dread from outside interference. More and more the increasinginterdependence and complexity of international political and economicrelations render it incumbent on all civilized and orderly powers toinsist on the proper policing of the world.During the fall of 1901 a communication was addressed to the Secretaryof State, asking whether permission would be granted by the Presidentto a corporation to lay a cable from a point on the California coast tothe Philippine Islands by way of Hawaii. A statement of conditions orterms upon which such corporation would undertake to lay and operate acable was volunteered.Inasmuch as the Congress was shortly to convene, and Pacific cablelegislation had been the subject of consideration by the Congress forseveral years, it seemed to me wise to defer action upon theapplication until the Congress had first an opportunity to act. TheCongress adjourned without taking any action, leaving the matter inexactly the same condition in which it stood when the Congressconvened.Meanwhile it appears that the Commercial Pacific Cable Company hadpromptly proceeded with preparations for laying its cable. It also madeapplication to the President for access to and use of soundings takenby the U. S. S. Nero, for the purpose of discovering a practicableroute for a trans Pacific cable, the company urging that with access tothese soundings it could complete its cable much sooner than if it wererequired to take soundings upon its own account. Pending considerationof this subject, it appeared important and desirable to attach certainconditions to the permission to examine and use the soundings, if itshould be granted.In consequence of this solicitation of the cable company, certainconditions were formulated, upon which the President was willing toallow access to these soundings and to consent to the landing andlaying of the cable, subject to any alterations or additions theretoimposed by the Congress. This was deemed proper, especially as it wasclear that a cable connection of some kind with China, a foreigncountry, was a part of the company\'s plan. This course was, moreover,in accordance with a line of precedents, including President Grant\'saction in the case of the first French cable, explained to the Congressin his Annual Message of December, 1875, and the instance occurring in1879 of the second French cable from Brest to St. Pierre, with a branchto Cape Cod.These conditions prescribed, among other things, a maximum rate forcommercial messages and that the company should construct a line fromthe Philippine Islands to China, there being at present, as is wellknown, a British line from Manila to Hongkong.The representatives of the cable company kept these conditions longunder consideration, continuing, in the meantime, to prepare for layingthe cable. They have, however, at length acceded to them, and anall American line between our Pacific coast and the Chinese Empire, byway of Honolulu and the Philippine Islands, is thus provided for, andis expected within a few months to be ready for business.Among the conditions is one reserving the power of the Congress tomodify or repeal any or all of them. A copy of the conditions isherewith transmitted.Of Porto Rico it is only necessary to say that the prosperity of theisland and the wisdom with which it has been governed have been such asto make it serve as an example of all that is best in insularadministration.On July 4 last, on the one hundred and twenty sixth anniversary of thedeclaration of our independence, peace and amnesty were promulgated inthe Philippine Islands. Some trouble has since from time to timethreatened with the Mohammedan Moros, but with the late insurrectionaryFilipinos the war has entirely ceased. Civil government has now beenintroduced. Not only does each Filipino enjoy such rights to life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as he has never before knownduring the recorded history of the islands, but the people taken as awhole now enjoy a measure of self government greater than that grantedto any other Orientals by any foreign power and greater than thatenjoyed by any other Orientals under their own governments, save theJapanese alone. We have not gone too far in granting these rights ofliberty and self government; but we have certainly gone to the limitthat in the interests of the Philippine people themselves it was wiseor just to go. To hurry matters, to go faster than we are now going,would entail calamity on the people of the islands. No policy everentered into by the American people has vindicated itself in moresignal manner than the policy of holding the Philippines. The triumphof our arms, above all the triumph of our laws and principles, has comesooner than we had any right to expect. Too much praise can not begiven to the Army for what it has done in the Philippines both inwarfare and from an administrative standpoint in preparing the way forcivil government; and similar credit belongs to the civil authoritiesfor the way in which they have planted the seeds of self government inthe ground thus made ready for them. The courage, the unflinchingendurance, the high soldierly efficiency; and the generalkind heartedness and humanity of our troops have been strikinglymanifested. There now remain only some fifteen thousand troops in theislands. All told, over one hundred thousand have been sent there. Ofcourse, there have been individual instances of wrongdoing among them.They warred under fearful difficulties of climate and surroundings; andunder the strain of the terrible provocations which they continuallyreceived from their foes, occasional instances of cruel retaliationoccurred. Every effort has been made to prevent such cruelties, andfinally these efforts have been completely successful. Every effort hasalso been made to detect and punish the wrongdoers. After making allallowance for these misdeeds, it remains true that few indeed have beenthe instances in which war has been waged by a civilized power againstsemicivilized or barbarous forces where there has been so littlewrongdoing by the victors as in the Philippine Islands. On the otherhand, the amount of difficult, important, and beneficent work which hasbeen done is well nigh incalculable.Taking the work of the Army and the civil authorities together, it maybe questioned whether anywhere else in modern times the world has seena better example of real constructive statesmanship than our peoplehave given in the Philippine Islands. High praise should also be giventhose Filipinos, in the aggregate very numerous, who have accepted thenew conditions and joined with our representatives to work with heartygood will for the welfare of the islands.The Army has been reduced to the minimum allowed by law. It is verysmall for the size of the Nation, and most certainly should be kept atthe highest point of efficiency. The senior officers are given scantchance under ordinary conditions to exercise commands commensurate withtheir rank, under circumstances which would fit them to do their dutyin time of actual war. A system of maneuvering our Army in bodies ofsome little size has been begun and should be steadily continued.Without such maneuvers it is folly to expect that in the event ofhostilities with any serious foe even a small army corps could behandled to advantage. Both our officers and enlisted men are such thatwe can take hearty pride in them. No better material can be found. Butthey must be thoroughly trained, both as individuals and in the mass.The marksmanship of the men must receive special attention. In thecircumstances of modern warfare the man must act far more on his ownindividual responsibility than ever before, and the high individualefficiency of the unit is of the utmost importance. Formerly this unitwas the regiment; it is now not the regiment, not even the troop orcompany; it is the individual soldier. Every effort must be made todevelop every workmanlike and soldierly quality in both the officer andthe enlisted man.I urgently call your attention to the need of passing a bill providingfor a general staff and for the reorganization of the supplydepartments on the lines of the bill proposed by the Secretary of Warlast year. When the young officers enter the Army from West Point theyprobably stand above their compeers in any other military service.Every effort should be made, by training, by reward of merit, byscrutiny into their careers and capacity, to keep them of the same highrelative excellence throughout their careers.The measure providing for the reorganization of the militia system andfor securing the highest efficiency in the National Guard, which hasalready passed the House, should receive prompt attention and action.It is of great importance that the relation of the National Guard tothe militia and volunteer forces of the United States should bedefined, and that in place of our present obsolete laws a practical andefficient system should be adopted.Provision should be made to enable the Secretary of War to keep cavalryand artillery horses, worn out in long performance of duty. Such horsesfetch but a trifle when sold; and rather than turn them out to themisery awaiting them when thus disposed of, it would be better toemploy them at light work around the posts, and when necessary to putthem painlessly to death.For the first time in our history naval maneuvers on a large scale arebeing held under the immediate command of the Admiral of the Navy.Constantly increasing attention is being paid to the gunnery of theNavy, but it is yet far from what it should be. I earnestly urge thatthe increase asked for by the Secretary of the Navy in theappropriation for improving the markmanship be granted. In battle theonly shots that count are the shots that hit. It is necessary toprovide ample funds for practice with the great guns in time of peace.These funds must provide not only for the purchase of projectiles, butfor allowances for prizes to encourage the gun crews, and especiallythe gun pointers, and for perfecting an intelligent system under whichalone it is possible to get good practice.There should be no halt in the work of building up the Navy, providingevery year additional fighting craft. We are a very rich country, vastin extent of territory and great in population; a country, moreover,which has an Army diminutive indeed when compared with that of anyother first class power. We have deliberately made our own certainforeign policies which demand the possession of a first class navy. Theisthmian canal will greatly increase the efficiency of our Navy if theNavy is of sufficient size; but if we have an inadequate navy, then thebuilding of the canal would be merely giving a hostage to any power ofsuperior strength. The Monroe Doctrine should be treated as thecardinal feature of American foreign policy; but it would be worse thanidle to assert it unless we intended to back it up, and it can bebacked up only by a thoroughly good navy. A good navy is not aprovocative of war. It is the surest guaranty of peace.Each individual unit of our Navy should be the most efficient of itskind as regards both material and personnel that is to be found in theworld. I call your special attention to the need of providing for themanning of the ships. Serious trouble threatens us if we can not dobetter than we are now doing as regards securing the services of asufficient number of the highest type of sailormen, of sea mechanics.The veteran seamen of our war ships are of as high a type as can befound in any navy which rides the waters of the world; they areunsurpassed in daring, in resolution, in readiness, in thoroughknowledge of their profession. They deserve every consideration thatcan be shown them. But there are not enough of them. It is no morepossible to improvise a crew than it is possible to improvise a warship. To build the finest ship, with the deadliest battery, and to sendit afloat with a raw crew, no matter how brave they were individually,would be to insure disaster if a foe of average capacity wereencountered. Neither ships nor men can be improvised when war hasbegun.We need a thousand additional officers in order to properly man theships now provided for and under construction. The classes at the NavalSchool at Annapolis should be greatly enlarged. At the same time thatwe thus add the officers where we need them, we should facilitate theretirement of those at the head of the list whose usefulness has becomeimpaired. Promotion must be fostered if the service is to be keptefficient.The lamentable scarcity of officers, and the large number of recruitsand of unskilled men necessarily put aboard the new vessels as theyhave been commissioned, has thrown upon our officers, and especially onthe lieutenants and junior grades, unusual labor and fatigue and hasgravely strained their powers of endurance. Nor is there sign of anyimmediate let up in this strain. It must continue for some time longer,until more officers are graduated from Annapolis, and until therecruits become trained and skillful in their duties. In thesedifficulties incident upon the development of our war fleet the conductof all our officers has been creditable to the service, and thelieutenants and junior grades in particular have displayed an abilityand a steadfast cheerfulness which entitles them to the ungrudgingthanks of all who realize the disheartening trials and fatigues towhich they are of necessity subjected.There is not a cloud on the horizon at present. There seems not theslightest chance of trouble with a foreign power. We most earnestlyhope that this state of things may continue; and the way to insure itscontinuance is to provide for a thoroughly efficient navy. The refusalto maintain such a navy would invite trouble, and if trouble came wouldinsure disaster. Fatuous self complacency or vanity, orshort sightedness in refusing to prepare for danger, is both foolishand wicked in such a nation as ours; and past experience has shown thatsuch fatuity in refusing to recognize or prepare for any crisis inadvance is usually succeeded by a mad panic of hysterical fear once thecrisis has actually arrived.The striking increase in the revenues of the Post Office Departmentshows clearly the prosperity of our people and the increasing activityof the business of the country.The receipts of the Post Office Department for the fiscal year endingJune 30 last amounted to $121,848,047.26, an increase of $10,216,853.87over the preceding year, the largest increase known in the history ofthe postal service. The magnitude of this increase will best appearfrom the fact that the entire postal receipts for the year 1860amounted to but $8,518,067.Rural free delivery service is no longer in the experimental stage; ithas become a fixed policy. The results following its introduction havefully justified the Congress in the large appropriations made for itsestablishment and extension. The average yearly increase in post officereceipts in the rural districts of the country is about two per cent.We are now able, by actual results, to show that where ruralfree delivery service has been established to such an extent as toenable us to make comparisons the yearly increase has been upward often per cent.On November 1, 1902, 11,650 rural free delivery routes had beenestablished and were in operation, covering about one third of theterritory of the United States available for rural free deliveryservice. There are now awaiting the action of the Department petitionsand applications for the establishment of 10,748 additional routes.This shows conclusively the want which the establishment of the servicehas met and the need of further extending it as rapidly as possible. Itis justified both by the financial results and by the practicalbenefits to our rural population; it brings the men who live on thesoil into close relations with the active business world; it keeps thefarmer in daily touch with the markets; it is a potential educationalforce; it enhances the value of farm property, makes farm life farpleasanter and less isolated, and will do much to check the undesirablecurrent from country to city.It is to be hoped that the Congress will make liberal appropriationsfor the continuance of the service already established and for itsfurther extension.Few subjects of more importance have been taken up by the Congress inrecent years than the inauguration of the system of nationally aidedirrigation for the arid regions of the far West. A good beginningtherein has been made. Now that this policy of national irrigation hasbeen adopted, the need of thorough and scientific forest protectionwill grow more rapidly than ever throughout the public land States.Legislation should be provided for the protection of the game, and thewild creatures generally, on the forest reserves. The senselessslaughter of game, which can by judicious protection be permanentlypreserved on our national reserves for the people as a whole, should bestopped at once. It is, for instance, a serious count against ournational good sense to permit the present practice of butchering offsuch a stately and beautiful creature as the elk for its antlers ortusks.So far as they are available for agriculture, and to whatever extentthey may be reclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remainingpublic lands should be held rigidly for the home builder, the settlerwho lives on his land, and for no one else. In their actual use thedesert land law, the timber and stone law, and the commutation clauseof the homestead law have been so perverted from the intention withwhich they were enacted as to permit the acquisition of large areas ofthe public domain for other than actual settlers and the consequentprevention of settlement. Moreover, the approaching exhaustion of thepublic ranges has of late led to much discussion as to the best mannerof using these public lands in the West which are suitable chiefly oronly for grazing. The sound and steady development of the West dependsupon the building up of homes therein. Much of our prosperity as anation has been due to the operation of the homestead law. On the otherhand, we should recognize the fact that in the grazing region the manwho corresponds to the homesteader may be unable to settle permanentlyif only allowed to use the same amount of pasture land that hisbrother, the homesteader, is allowed to use of arable land. One hundredand sixty acres of fairly rich and well watered soil, or a much smalleramount of irrigated land, may keep a family in plenty, whereas no onecould get a living from one hundred and sixty acres of dry pasture landcapable of supporting at the outside only one head of cattle to everyten acres. In the past great tracts of the public domain have beenfenced in by persons having no title thereto, in direct defiance of thelaw forbidding the maintenance or construction of any such unlawfulinclosure of public land. For various reasons there has been littleinterference with such inclosures in the past, but ample notice has nowbeen given the trespassers, and all the resources at the command of theGovernment will hereafter be used to put a stop to such trespassing.In view of the capital importance of these matters, I commend them tothe earnest consideration of the Congress, and if the Congress findsdifficulty in dealing with them from lack of thorough knowledge of thesubject, I recommend that provision be made for a commission of expertsspecially to investigate and report upon the complicated questionsinvolved.I especially urge upon the Congress the need of wise legislation forAlaska. It is not to our credit as a nation that Alaska, which has beenours for thirty five years, should still have as poor a system Of lawsas is the case. No country has a more valuable possession in mineralwealth, in fisheries, furs, forests, and also in land available forcertain kinds of farming and stockgrowing. It is a territory of greatsize and varied resources, well fitted to support a large permanentpopulation. Alaska needs a good land law and such provisions forhomesteads and pre emptions as will encourage permanent settlement. Weshould shape legislation with a view not to the exploiting andabandoning of the territory, but to the building up of homes therein.The land laws should be liberal in type, so as to hold out inducementsto the actual settler whom we most desire to see take possession of thecountry. The forests of Alaska should be protected, and, as a secondarybut still important matter, the game also, and at the same time it isimperative that the settlers should be allowed to cut timber, underproper regulations, for their own use. Laws should be enacted toprotect the Alaskan salmon fisheries against the greed which woulddestroy them. They should be preserved as a permanent industry and foodsupply. Their management and control should be turned over to theCommission of Fish and Fisheries. Alaska should have a Delegate in theCongress. It would be well if a Congressional committee could visitAlaska and investigate its needs on the ground.In dealing with the Indians our aim should be their ultimate absorptioninto the body of our people. But in many cases this absorption must andshould be very slow. In portions of the Indian Territory the mixture ofblood has gone on at the same time with progress in wealth andeducation, so that there are plenty of men with varying degrees ofpurity of Indian blood who are absolutely indistinguishable in point ofsocial, political, and economic ability from their white associates.There are other tribes which have as yet made no perceptible advancetoward such equality. To try to force such tribes too fast is toprevent their going forward at all. Moreover, the tribes live underwidely different conditions. Where a tribe has made considerableadvance and lives on fertile farming soil it is possible to allot themembers lands in severalty much as is the case with white settlers.There are other tribes where such a course is not desirable. On thearid prairie lands the effort should be to induce the Indians to leadpastoral rather than agricultural lives, and to permit them to settlein villages rather than to force them into isolation.The large Indian schools situated remote from any Indian reservation doa special and peculiar work of great importance. But, excellent thoughthese are, an immense amount of additional work must be done on thereservations themselves among the old, and above all among the young,Indians.The first and most important step toward the absorption of the Indianis to teach him to earn his living; yet it is not necessarily to beassumed that in each community all Indians must become either tillersof the soil or stock raisers. Their industries may properly bediversified, and those who show special desire or adaptability forindustrial or even commercial pursuits should be encouraged so far aspracticable to follow out each his own bent.Every effort should be made to develop the Indian along the lines ofnatural aptitude, and to encourage the existing native industriespeculiar to certain tribes, such as the various kinds of basketweaving, canoe building, smith work, and blanket work. Above all, theIndian boys and girls should be given confident command of colloquialEnglish, and should ordinarily be prepared for a vigorous struggle withthe conditions under which their people live, rather than for immediateabsorption into some more highly developed community.The officials who represent the Government in dealing with the Indianswork under hard conditions, and also under conditions which render iteasy to do wrong and very difficult to detect wrong. Consequently theyshould be amply paid on the one hand, and on the other hand aparticularly high standard of conduct should be demanded from them, andwhere misconduct can be proved the punishment should be exemplary.In no department of governmental work in recent years has there beengreater success than in that of giving scientific aid to the farmingpopulation, thereby showing them how most efficiently to helpthemselves. There is no need of insisting upon its importance, for thewelfare of the farmer is fundamentally necessary to the welfare of theRepublic as a whole. In addition to such work as quarantine againstanimal and vegetable plagues, and warring against them when hereintroduced, much efficient help has been rendered to the farmer by theintroduction of new plants specially fitted for cultivation under thepeculiar conditions existing in different portions of the country. Newcereals have been established in the semi arid West. For instance, thepracticability of producing the best types of macaroni wheats inregions of an annual rainfall of only ten inches or thereabouts hasbeen conclusively demonstrated. Through the introduction of new ricesin Louisiana and Texas the production of rice in this country has beenmade to about equal the home demand. In the South west the possibilityof regrassing overstocked range lands has been demonstrated; in theNorth many new forage crops have been introduced, while in the East ithas been shown that some of our choicest fruits can be stored andshipped in such a way as to find a profitable market abroad.I again recommend to the favorable consideration of the Congress theplans of the Smithsonian Institution for making the Museum under itscharge worthy of the Nation, and for preserving at the National Capitalnot only records of the vanishing races of men but of the animals ofthis continent which, like the buffalo, will soon become extinct unlessspecimens from which their representatives may be renewed are sought intheir native regions and maintained there in safety.The District of Columbia is the only part of our territory in which theNational Government exercises local or municipal functions, and wherein consequence the Government has a free hand in reference to certaintypes of social and economic legislation which must be essentiallylocal or municipal in their character. The Government should see to it,for instance, that the hygienic and sanitary legislation affectingWashington is of a high character. The evils of slum dwellings, whetherin the shape of crowded and congested tenement house districts or ofthe back alley type, should never be permitted to grow up inWashington. The city should be a model in every respect for all thecities of the country. The charitable and correctional systems of theDistrict should receive consideration at the hands of the Congress tothe end that they may embody the results of the most advanced thoughtin these fields. Moreover, while Washington is not a great industrialcity, there is some industrialism here, and our labor legislation,while it would not be important in itself, might be made a model forthe rest of the Nation. We should pass, for instance, a wiseemployer\'s liability act for the District of Columbia, and we need suchan act in our navy yards. Railroad companies in the District ought tobe required by law to block their frogs.The safety appliance law, for the better protection of the lives andlimbs of railway employees, which was passed in 1893, went into fulleffect on August 1, 1901. It has resulted in averting thousands ofcasualties. Experience shows, however, the necessity of additionallegislation to perfect this law. A bill to provide for this passed theSenate at the last session. It is to be hoped that some such measuremay now be enacted into law.There is a growing tendency to provide for the publication of masses ofdocuments for which there is no public demand and for the printing ofwhich there is no real necessity. Large numbers of volumes are turnedout by the Government printing presses for which there is nojustification. Nothing should be printed by any of the Departmentsunless it contains something of permanent value, and the Congress couldwith advantage cut down very materially on all the printing which ithas now become customary to provide. The excessive cost of Governmentprinting is a strong argument against the position of those who areinclined on abstract grounds to advocate the Government\'s doing anywork which can with propriety be left in private hands.Gratifying progress has been made during the year in the extension ofthe merit system of making appointments in the Government service. Itshould be extended by law to the District of Columbia. It is much to bedesired that our consular system be established by law on a basisproviding for appointment and promotion only in consequence of provedfitness.Through a wise provision of the Congress at its last session the WhiteHouse, which had become disfigured by incongruous additions andchanges, has now been restored to what it was planned to be byWashington. In making the restorations the utmost care has beenexercised to come as near as possible to the early plans and tosupplement these plans by a careful study of such buildings as that ofthe University of Virginia, which was built by Jefferson. The WhiteHouse is the property of the Nation, and so far as is compatible withliving therein it should be kept as it originally was, for the samereasons that we keep Mount Vernon as it originally was. The statelysimplicity of its architecture is an expression of the character of theperiod in which it was built, and is in accord with the purposes it wasdesigned to serve. It is a good thing to preserve such buildings ashistoric monuments which keep alive our sense of continuity with theNation\'s past.The reports of the several Executive Departments are submitted to theCongress with this communication.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The country is to be congratulated on the amount of substantialachievement which has marked the past year both as regards our foreignand as regards our domestic policy.With a nation as with a man the most important things are those of thehousehold, and therefore the country is especially to be congratulatedon what has been accomplished in the direction of providing for theexercise of supervision over the great corporations and combinations ofcorporations engaged in interstate commerce. The Congress has createdthe Department of Commerce and Labor, including the Bureau ofCorporations, with for the first time authority to secure properpublicity of such proceedings of these great corporations as the publichas the right to know. It has provided for the expediting of suits forthe enforcement of the Federal anti trust law; and by another law ithas secured equal treatment to all producers in the transportation oftheir goods, thus taking a long stride forward in making effective thework of the Interstate Commerce Commission.The establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor, with theBureau of Corporations thereunder, marks a real advance in thedirection of doing all that is possible for the solution of thequestions vitally affecting capitalists and wage workers. The actcreating Department was approved on February 14, 1903, and two dayslater the head of the Department was nominated and confirmed by theSenate. Since then the work of organization has been pushed as rapidlyas the initial appropriations permitted, and with due regard tothoroughness and the broad purposes which the Department is designed toserve. After the transfer of the various bureaus and branches to theDepartment at the beginning of the current fiscal year, as provided forin the act, the personnel comprised 1,289 employees in Washington and8,836 in the country at large. The scope of the Department\'s duty andauthority embraces the commercial and industrial interests of theNation. It is not designed to restrict or control the fullest libertyof legitimate business action, but to secure exact and authenticinformation which will aid the Executive in enforcing existing laws,and which will enable the Congress to enact additional legislation, ifany should be found necessary, in order to prevent the few fromobtaining privileges at the expense of diminished opportunities for themany.The preliminary work of the Bureau of Corporations in the Departmenthas shown the wisdom of its creation. Publicity in corporate affairswill tend to do away with ignorance, and will afford facts upon whichintelligent action may be taken. Systematic, intelligent investigationis already developing facts the knowledge of which is essential to aright understanding of the needs and duties of the business world. Thecorporation which is honestly and fairly organized, whose managers inthe conduct of its business recognize their obligation to deal squarelywith their stockholders, their competitors, and the public, has nothingto fear from such supervision. The purpose of this Bureau is not toembarrass or assail legitimate business, but to aid in bringing about abetter industrial condition a condition under which there shall beobedience to law and recognition of public obligation by allcorporations, great or small. The Department of Commerce and Labor willbe not only the clearing house for information regarding the businesstransactions of the Nation, but the executive arm of the Government toaid in strengthening our domestic and foreign markets, in perfectingour transportation facilities, in building up our merchant marine, inpreventing the entrance of undesirable immigrants, in improvingcommercial and industrial conditions, and in bringing together oncommon ground those necessary partners in industrial progress capitaland labor. Commerce between the nations is steadily growing in volume,and the tendency of the times is toward closer trade relations.Constant watchfulness is needed to secure to Americans the chance toparticipate to the best advantage in foreign trade; and we mayconfidently expect that the new Department will justify the expectationof its creators by the exercise of this watchfulness, as well as by thebusinesslike administration of such laws relating to our internalaffairs as are intrusted to its care.In enacting the laws above enumerated the Congress proceeded on saneand conservative lines. Nothing revolutionary was attempted; but acommon sense and successful effort was made in the direction of seeingthat corporations are so handled as to subserve the public good. Thelegislation was moderate. It was characterized throughout by the ideathat we were not attacking corporations, but endeavoring to provide fordoing away with any evil in them; that we drew the line againstmisconduct, not against wealth; gladly recognizing the great good doneby the capitalist who alone, or in conjunction with his fellows, doeshis work along proper and legitimate lines. The purpose of thelegislation, which purpose will undoubtedly be fulfilled, was to favorsuch a man when he does well, and to supervise his action only toprevent him from doing ill. Publicity can do no harm to the honestcorporation. The only corporation that has cause to dread it is thecorporation which shrinks from the light, and about the welfare of suchcorporations we need not be oversensitive. The work of the Departmentof Commerce and Labor has been conditioned upon this theory, ofsecuring fair treatment alike for labor and for capital.The consistent policy of the National Government, so far as it has thepower, is to hold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer oremployee; but to refuse to weaken individual initiative or to hamper orcramp the industrial development of the country. We recognize that thisis an era of federation and combination, in which great capitalisticcorporations and labor unions have become factors of tremendousimportance in all industrial centers. Hearty recognition is given thefar reaching, beneficent work which has been accomplished through bothcorporations and unions, and the line as between differentcorporations, as between different unions, is drawn as it is betweendifferent individuals; that is, it is drawn on conduct, the effortbeing to treat both organized capital and organized labor alike; askingnothing save that the interest of each shall be brought into harmonywith the interest of the general public, and that the conduct of eachshall conform to the fundamental rules of obedience to law, ofindividual freedom, and of justice and fair dealing towards all.Whenever either corporation, labor union, or individual disregards thelaw or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and tyrannous interference withthe rights of others, whether corporations or individuals, then wherethe Federal Government has jurisdiction, it will see to it that themisconduct is stopped, paying not the slightest heed to the position orpower of the corporation, the union or the individual, but only to onevital fact that is, the question whether or not the conduct of theindividual or aggregate of individuals is in accordance with the law ofthe land. Every man must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to doas he likes with his property or his labor, so long as he does notinfringe the rights of others. No man is above the law and no man isbelow it; nor do we ask any man\'s permission when we require him toobey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as afavor.We have cause as a nation to be thankful for the steps that have beenso successfully taken to put these principles into effect. The progresshas been by evolution, not by revolution. Nothing radical has beendone; the action has been both moderate and resolute. Therefore thework will stand. There shall be no backward step. If in the working ofthe laws it proves desirable that they shall at any point be expandedor amplified, the amendment can be made as its desirability is shown.Meanwhile they are being administered with judgment, but withinsistence upon obedience to them, and their need has been emphasizedin signal fashion by the events of the past year.From all sources, exclusive of the postal service, the receipts of theGovernment for the last fiscal year aggregated $560,396,674. Theexpenditures for the same period were $506,099,007, the surplus for thefiscal year being $54,297,667. The indications are that the surplus forthe present fiscal year will be very small, if indeed there be anysurplus. From July to November the receipts from customs were,approximately, nine million dollars less than the receipts from thesame source for a corresponding portion of last year. Should thisdecrease continue at the same ratio throughout the fiscal year, thesurplus would be reduced by, approximately, thirty million dollars.Should the revenue from customs suffer much further decrease during thefiscal year, the surplus would vanish. A large surplus is certainlyundesirable. Two years ago the war taxes were taken off with theexpress intention of equalizing the governmental receipts andexpenditures, and though the first year thereafter still showed asurplus, it now seems likely that a substantial equality of revenue andexpenditure will be attained. Such being the case it is of great momentboth to exercise care and economy in appropriations, and to scansharply any change in our fiscal revenue system which may reduce ourincome. The need of strict economy in our expenditures is emphasized bythe fact that we can not afford to be parsimonious in providing forwhat is essential to our national well being. Careful economy whereverpossible will alone prevent our income from falling below the pointrequired in order to meet our genuine needs.The integrity of our currency is beyond question, and under presentconditions it would be unwise and unnecessary to attempt areconstruction of our entire monetary system. The same liberty shouldbe granted the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit customs receipts asis granted him in the deposit of receipts from other sources. In myMessage of December 2, 1902, I called attention to certain needs of thefinancial situation, and I again ask the consideration of the Congressfor these questions.During the last session of the Congress at the suggestion of a jointnote from the Republic of Mexico and the Imperial Government of China,and in harmony with an act of the Congress appropriating $25,000 to paythe expenses thereof, a commission was appointed to confer with theprincipal European countries in the hope that some plan might bedevised whereby a fixed rate of exchange could be assured between thegold standard countries and the silver standard countries. Thiscommission has filed its preliminary report, which has been madepublic. I deem it important that the commission be continued, and thata sum of money be appropriated sufficient to pay the expenses of itsfurther labors.A majority of our people desire that steps be taken in the interests ofAmerican shipping, so that we may once more resume our former positionin the ocean carrying trade. But hitherto the differences of opinion asto the proper method of reaching this end have been so wide that it hasproved impossible to secure the adoption of any particular scheme.Having in view these facts, I recommend that the Congress direct theSecretary of the Navy, the Postmaster General, and the Secretary ofCommerce and Labor, associated with such a representation from theSenate and House of Representatives as the Congress in its wisdom maydesignate, to serve as a commission for the purpose of investigatingand reporting to the Congress at its next session what legislation isdesirable or necessary for the development of the American merchantmarine and American commerce, and incidentally of a national ocean mailservice of adequate auxiliary naval crusiers and naval reserves. Whilesuch a measure is desirable in any event, it is especially desirable atthis time, in view of the fact that our present governmental contractfor ocean mail with the American Line will expire in 1905. Our oceanmail act was passed in 1891. In 1895 our 20 knot transatlantic mailline was equal to any foreign line. Since then the Germans have put on23 knot, steamers, and the British have contracted for 24 knotsteamers. Our service should equal the best. If it does not, thecommercial public will abandon it. If we are to stay in the business itought to be with a full understanding of the advantages to the countryon one hand, and on the other with exact knowledge of the cost andproper methods of carrying it on. Moreover, lines of cargo ships are ofeven more importance than fast mail lines; save so far as the lattercan be depended upon to furnish swift auxiliary cruisers in time ofwar. The establishment of new lines of cargo ships to South America, toAsia, and elsewhere would be much in the interest of our commercialexpansion.We can not have too much immigration of the right kind, and we shouldhave none at all of the wrong kind. The need is to devise some systemby which undesirable immigrants shall be kept out entirely, whiledesirable immigrants are properly distributed throughout the country.At present some districts which need immigrants have none; and inothers, where the population is already congested, immigrants come insuch numbers as to depress the conditions of life for those alreadythere. During the last two years the immigration service at New Yorkhas been greatly improved, and the corruption and inefficiency whichformerly obtained there have been eradicated. This service has justbeen investigated by a committee of New York citizens of high standing,Messrs. Arthur V. Briesen, Lee K. Frankel, Eugene A. Philbin, Thomas W.Hynes, and Ralph Trautman. Their report deals with the whole situationat length, and concludes with certain recommendations foradministrative and legislative action. It is now receiving theattention of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.The special investigation of the subject of naturalization under thedirection of the Attorney General, and the consequent prosecutionsreveal a condition of affairs calling for the immediate attention ofthe Congress. Forgeries and perjuries of shameless and flagrantcharacter have been perpetrated, not only in the dense centers ofpopulation, but throughout the country; and it is established beyonddoubt that very many so called citizens of the United States have notitle whatever to that right, and are asserting and enjoying thebenefits of the same through the grossest frauds. It is never to beforgotten that citizenship is, to quote the words recently used by theSupreme Court of the United States, an "inestimable heritage," whetherit proceeds from birth within the country or is obtained bynaturalization; and we poison the sources of our national character andstrength at the fountain, if the privilege is claimed and exercisedwithout right, and by means of fraud and corruption. The body politiccan not be sound and healthy if many of its constituent members claimtheir standing through the prostitution of the high right and callingof citizenship. It should mean something to become a citizen of theUnited States; and in the process no loophole whatever should be leftopen to fraud.The methods by which these frauds now under full investigation with aview to meting out punishment and providing adequate remedies areperpetrated, include many variations of procedure by which falsecertificates of citizenship are forged in their entirety; or genuinecertificates fraudulently or collusively obtained in blank are filledin by the criminal conspirators; or certificates are obtained onfraudulent statements as to the time of arrival and residence in thiscountry; or imposition and substitution of another party for the realpetitioner occur in court; or certificates are made the subject ofbarter and sale and transferred from the rightful holder to those notentitled to them; or certificates are forged by erasure of the originalnames and the insertion of the names of other persons not entitled tothe same.It is not necessary for me to refer here at large to the causes leadingto this state of affairs. The desire for naturalization is heartily tobe commended where it springs from a sincere and permanent intention tobecome citizens, and a real appreciation of the privilege. But it is asource of untold evil and trouble where it is traceable to selfish anddishonest motives, such as the effort by artificial and improper means,in wholesale fashion to create voters who are ready made tools ofcorrupt politicians, or the desire to evade certain labor laws creatingdiscriminations against alien labor. All good citizens, whethernaturalized or native born, are equally interested in protecting ourcitizenship against fraud in any form, and, on the other hand, inaffording every facility for naturalization to those who in good faithdesire to share alike our privileges and our responsibilities.The Federal grand jury lately in session in New York City dealt withthis subject and made a presentment which states the situation brieflyand forcibly and contains important suggestions for the considerationof the Congress. This presentment is included as an appendix to thereport of the Attorney General.In my last annual Message, in connection with the subject of the dueregulation of combinations of capital which are or may become injuriousto the public, I recommend a special appropriation for the betterenforcement of the antitrust law as it now stands, to be extended underthe direction of the Attorney General. Accordingly (by the legislative,executive, and judicial appropriation act of February 25, 1903, 32Stat., 854, 904), the Congress appropriated, for the purpose ofenforcing the various Federal trust and interstate commerce laws, thesum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be expended under thedirection of the Attorney General in the employment of special counseland agents in the Department of Justice to conduct proceedings andprosecutions under said laws in the courts of the United States. I nowrecommend, as a matter of the utmost importance and urgency, theextension of the purposes of this appropriation, so that it may beavailable, under the direction of the Attorney General, and until used,for the due enforcement of the laws of the United States in general andespecially of the civil and criminal laws relating to public lands andthe laws relating to postal crimes and offenses and the subject ofnaturalization. Recent investigations have shown a deplorable state ofaffairs in these three matters of vital concern. By various frauds andby forgeries and perjuries, thousands of acres of the public domain,embracing lands of different character and extending through varioussections of the country, have been dishonestly acquired. It is hardlynecessary to urge the importance of recovering these dishonestacquisitions, stolen from the people, and of promptly and dulypunishing the offenders. I speak in another part of this Message of thewidespread crimes by which the sacred right of citizenship is falselyasserted and that "inestimable heritage" perverted to base ends. Bysimilar means that is, through frauds, forgeries, and perjuries, andby shameless briberies the laws relating to the proper conduct of thepublic service in general and to the due administration of thePost Office Department have been notoriously violated, and manyindictments have been found, and the consequent prosecutions are incourse of hearing or on the eve thereof. For the reasons thusindicated, and so that the Government may be prepared to enforcepromptly and with the greatest effect the due penalties for suchviolations of law, and to this end may be furnished with sufficientinstrumentalities and competent legal assistance for the investigationsand trials which will be necessary at many different points of thecountry, I urge upon the Congress the necessity of making the saidappropriation available for immediate use for all such purposes, to beexpended under the direction of the Attorney General.Steps have been taken by the State Department looking to the making ofbribery an extraditable offense with foreign powers. The need of moreeffective treaties covering this crime is manifest. The exposures andprosecutions of official corruption in St. Louis, Mo., and other citiesand States have resulted in a number of givers and takers of bribesbecoming fugitives in foreign lands. Bribery has not been included inextradition treaties heretofore, as the necessity for it has notarisen. While there may have been as much official corruption in formeryears, there has been more developed and brought to light in theimmediate past than in the preceding century of our country\'s history.It should be the policy of the United States to leave no place on earthwhere a corrupt man fleeing from this country can rest in peace. Thereis no reason why bribery should not be included in all treaties asextraditable. The recent amended treaty with Mexico, whereby this crimewas put in the list of extraditable offenses, has established asalutary precedent in this regard. Under this treaty the StateDepartment has asked, and Mexico has granted, the extradition of one ofthe St. Louis bribe givers.There can be no crime more serious than bribery. Other offenses violateone law while corruption strikes at the foundation of all law. Underour form of Government all authority is vested in the people and bythem delegated to those who represent them in official capacity. Therecan be no offense heavier than that of him in whom such a sacred trusthas been reposed, who sells it for his own gain and enrichment; and noless heavy is the offense of the bribe giver. He is worse than thethief, for the thief robs the individual, while the corrupt officialplunders an entire city or State. He is as wicked as the murderer, forthe murderer may only take one life against the law, while the corruptofficial and the man who corrupts the official alike aim at theassassination of the commonwealth itself. Government of the people, bythe people, for the people will perish from the face of the earth ifbribery is tolerated. The givers and takers of bribes stand on an evilpre eminence of infamy. The exposure and punishment of publiccorruption is an honor to a nation, not a disgrace. The shame lies intoleration, not in correction. No city or State, still less the Nation,can be injured by the enforcement of law. As long as public plundererswhen detected can find a haven of refuge in any foreign land and avoidpunishment, just so long encouragement is given them to continue theirpractices. If we fail to do all that in us lies to stamp out corruptionwe can not escape our share of responsibility for the guilt. The firstrequisite of successful self government is unflinching enforcement ofthe law and the cutting out of corruption.For several years past the rapid development of Alaska and theestablishment of growing American interests in regions theretoforeunsurveyed and imperfectly known brought into prominence the urgentnecessity of a practical demarcation of the boundaries between thejurisdictions of the United States and Great Britain. Although thetreaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, the provisions ofwhich were copied in the treaty of 1867, whereby Russia conveyed Alaskato the United States, was positive as to the control, first by Russiaand later by the United States, of a strip of territory along thecontinental mainland from the western shore of Portland Canal to MountSt. Elias, following and surrounding the indentations of the coast andincluding the islands to the westward, its description of the landwardmargin of the strip was indefinite, resting on the supposed existenceof a continuous ridge or range of mountains skirting the coast, asfigured in the charts of the early navigators. It had at no time beenpossible for either party in interest to lay down, under the authorityof the treaty, a line so obviously exact according to its provisions asto command the assent of the other. For nearly three fourths of acentury the absence of tangible local interests demanding the exerciseof positive jurisdiction on either side of the border left the questiondormant. In 1878 questions of revenue administration on the StikineRiver led to the establishment of a provisional demarcation, crossingthe channel between two high peaks on either side about twenty fourmiles above the river mouth. In 1899 similar questions growing out ofthe extraordinary development of mining interests in the region aboutthe head of Lynn Canal brought about a temporary modus vivendi, bywhich a convenient separation was made at the watershed divides of theWhite and Chilkoot passes and to the north of Klukwan, on the KlehiniRiver. These partial and tentative adjustments could not, in the verynature of things, be satisfactory or lasting. A permanent dispositionof the matter became imperative.After unavailing attempts to reach an understanding through a JointHigh Commission, followed by prolonged negotiations, conducted in anamicable spirit, a convention between the United States and GreatBritain was signed, January 24, 1903, providing for an examination ofthe subject by a mixed tribunal of six members, three on a side, with aview to its final disposition. Ratifications were exchanged on March 3last, whereupon the two Governments appointed their respective members.Those on behalf of the United States were Elihu Root, Secretary of War,Henry Cabot Lodge, a Senator of the United States, and George Turner,an ex Senator of the United States, while Great Britain named the RightHonourable Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of England, Sir LouisAmable Jette, K. C. M. G., retired judge of the Supreme Court ofQuebec, and A. B. Aylesworth, K. C., of Toronto. This Tribunal met inLondon on September 3, under the Presidency of Lord Alverstone. Theproceedings were expeditious, and marked by a friendly andconscientious spirit. The respective cases, counter cases, andarguments presented the issues clearly and fully. On the 20th ofOctober a majority of the Tribunal reached and signed an agreement onall the questions submitted by the terms of the Convention. By thisaward the right of the United States to the control of a continuousstrip or border of the mainland shore, skirting all the tide waterinlets and sinuosities of the coast, is confirmed; the entrance toPortland Canal (concerning which legitimate doubt appeared) is definedas passing by Tongass Inlet and to the northwestward of Wales andPearse islands; a line is drawn from the head of Portland Canal to thefifty sixth degree of north latitude; and the interior border line ofthe strip is fixed by lines connecting certain mountain summits lyingbetween Portland Canal and Mount St. Elias, and running along the crestof the divide separating the coast slope from the inland watershed atthe only part of the frontier where the drainage ridge approaches thecoast within the distance of ten marine leagues stipulated by thetreaty as the extreme width of the strip around the heads of Lynn Canaland its branches.While the line so traced follows the provisional demarcation of 1878 atthe crossing of the Stikine River, and that of 1899 at the summits ofthe White and Chilkoot passes, it runs much farther inland from theKlehini than the temporary line of the later modus vivendi, and leavesthe entire mining district of the Porcupine River and Glacier Creekwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.The result is satisfactory in every way. It is of great materialadvantage to our people in the Far Northwest. It has removed from thefield of discussion and possible danger a question liable to becomemore acutely accentuated with each passing year. Finally, it hasfurnished a signal proof of the fairness and good will with which twofriendly nations can approach and determine issues involving nationalsovereignty and by their nature incapable of submission to a thirdpower for adjudication.The award is self executing on the vital points. To make it effectiveas regards the others it only remains for the two Governments toappoint, each on its own behalf, one or more scientific experts, whoshall, with all convenient speed, proceed together to lay down theboundary line in accordance with the decision of the majority of theTribunal. I recommend that the Congress make adequate provision for theappointment, compensation, and expenses of the members to serve on thisjoint boundary commission on the part of the United States.It will be remembered that during the second session of the lastCongress Great Britain, Germany, and Italy formed an alliance for thepurpose of blockading the ports of Venezuela and using such other meansof pressure as would secure a settlement of claims due, as theyalleged, to certain of their subjects. Their employment of force forthe collection of these claims was terminated by an agreement broughtabout through the offices of the diplomatic representatives of theUnited States at Caracas and the Government at Washington, therebyending a situation which was bound to cause increasing friction, andwhich jeoparded the peace of the continent. Under this agreementVenezuela agreed to set apart a certain percentage of the customsreceipts of two of her ports to be applied to the payment of whateverobligations might be ascertained by mixed commissions appointed forthat purpose to be due from her, not only to the three powers alreadymentioned, whose proceedings against her had resulted in a state ofwar, but also to the United States, France, Spain, Belgium, theNetherland Sweden and Norway, and Mexico, who had not employed forcefor the collection of the claims alleged to be due to certain of theircitizens.A demand was then made by the so called blockading powers that the sumsascertained to be due to their citizens by such mixed commissionsshould be accorded payment in full before anything was paid upon theclaims of any of the so called peace powers. Venezuela, on the otherhand, insisted that all her creditors should be paid upon a basis ofexact equality. During the efforts to adjust this dispute it wassuggested by the powers in interest that it should be referred to mefor decision, but I was clearly of the opinion that a far wiser coursewould be to submit the question to the Permanent Court of Arbitrationat The Hague. It seemed to me to offer an admirable opportunity toadvance the practice of the peaceful settlement of disputes betweennations and to secure for the Hague Tribunal a memorable increase ofits practical importance. The nations interested in the controversywere so numerous and in many instances so powerful as to make itevident that beneficent results would follow from their appearance atthe same time before the bar of that august tribunal of peace.Our hopes in that regard have been realized. Russia and Austria arerepresented in the persons of the learned and distinguished jurists whocompose the Tribunal, while Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain,Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, Mexico, the UnitedStates, and Venezuela are represented by their respective agents andcounsel. Such an imposing concourse of nations presenting theirarguments to and invoking the decision of that high court ofinternational justice and international peace can hardly fail to securea like submission of many future controversies. The nations nowappearing there will find it far easier to appear there a second time,while no nation can imagine its just pride will be lessened byfollowing the example now presented. This triumph of the principle ofinternational arbitration is a subject of warm congratulation andoffers a happy augury for the peace of the world.There seems good ground for the belief that there has been a realgrowth among the civilized nations of a sentiment which will permit agradual substitution of other methods than the method of war in thesettlement of disputes. It is not pretended that as yet we are near aposition in which it will be possible wholly to prevent war, or that ajust regard for national interest and honor will in all cases permit ofthe settlement of international disputes by arbitration; but by amixture of prudence and firmness with wisdom we think it is possible todo away with much of the provocation and excuse for war, and at leastin many cases to substitute some other and more rational method for thesettlement of disputes. The Hague Court offers so good an example ofwhat can be done in the direction of such settlement that it should beencouraged in every way.Further steps should be taken. In President McKinley\'s annual Messageof December 5, 1898, he made the following recommendation:"The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense ofthe burdens and the waste of war. We desire in common with mostcivilized nations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damagesustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It is true wemay suffer in such cases less than other communities, but all nationsare damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehensioninto which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercialworld. It should be our object, therefore, to minimize, so far aspracticable, this inevitable loss and disturbance. This purpose canprobably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regardall private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction bythe forces of belligerent powers. The United States Government has formany years advocated this humane and beneficent principle, and is nowin a position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation ofselfish motives. I therefore suggest for your consideration that theExecutive be authorized to correspond with the governments of theprincipal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into thepermanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption ofall private property at sea, not contraband of war, from capture ordestruction by belligerent powers."I cordially renew this recommendation.The Supreme Court, speaking on December 11. 1899, through Peckham, J.,said:"It is, we think, historically accurate to say that this Government hasalways been, in its views, among the most advanced of the governmentsof the world in favor of mitigating, as to all non combatants, thehardships and horrors of war. To accomplish that object it has alwaysadvocated those rules which would in most cases do away with the rightto capture the private property of an enemy on the high seas."I advocate this as a matter of humanity and morals. It is anachronisticwhen private property is respected on land that it should not berespected at sea. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that shippingrepresents, internationally speaking, a much more generalized speciesof private property than is the case with ordinary property onland that is, property found at sea is much less apt than is the casewith property found on land really to belong to any one nation. Underthe modern system of corporate ownership the flag of a vessel oftendiffers from the flag which would mark the nationality of the realownership and money control of the vessel; and the cargo may belong toindividuals of yet a different nationality. Much American capital isnow invested in foreign ships; and among foreign nations it oftenhappens that the capital of one is largely invested in the shipping ofanother. Furthermore, as a practical matter, it may be mentioned thatwhile commerce destroying may cause serious loss and great annoyance,it can never be more than a subsidiary factor in bringing to terms aresolute foe. This is now well recognized by all of our naval experts.The fighting ship, not the commerce destroyer, is the vessel whosefeats add renown to a nation\'s history, and establish her place amongthe great powers of the world.Last year the Interparliamentary Union for International Arbitrationmet at Vienna, six hundred members of the different legislatures ofcivilized countries attending. It was provided that the next meetingshould be in 1904 at St. Louis, subject to our Congress extending aninvitation. Like the Hague Tribunal, this Interparliamentary Union isone of the forces tending towards peace among the nations of the earth,and it is entitled to our support. I trust the invitation can beextended.Early in July, having received intelligence, which happily turned outto be erroneous, of the assassination of our vice consul at Beirut, Idispatched a small squadron to that port for such service as might befound necessary on arrival. Although the attempt on the life of ourvice consul had not been successful, yet the outrage was symptomatic ofa state of excitement and disorder which demanded immediate attention.The arrival of the vessels had the happiest result. A feeling ofsecurity at once took the place of the former alarm and disquiet; ourofficers were cordially welcomed by the consular body and the leadingmerchants, and ordinary business resumed its activity. The Governmentof the Sultan gave a considerate hearing to the representations of ourminister; the official who was regarded as responsible for thedisturbed condition of affairs was removed. Our relations with theTurkish Government remain friendly; our claims rounded on inequitabletreatment of some of our schools and missions appear to be in processof amicable adjustment.The signing of a new commercial treaty with China, which took place atShanghai on the 8th of October, is a cause for satisfaction. This act,the result of long discussion and negotiation, places our commercialrelations with the great Oriental Empire on a more satisfactory footingthan they have ever heretofore enjoyed. It provides not only for theordinary rights and privileges of diplomatic and consular officers, butalso for an important extension of our commerce by increased facilityof access to Chinese ports, and for the relief of trade by the removalof some of the obstacles which have embarrassed it in the past. TheChinese Government engages, on fair and equitable conditions, whichwill probably be accepted by the principal commercial nations, toabandon the levy of "liken" and other transit dues throughout theEmpire, and to introduce other desirable administrative reforms. Largerfacilities are to be given to our citizens who desire to carry onmining enterprises in China. We have secured for our missionaries avaluable privilege, the recognition of their right to rent and lease inperpetuity such property as their religious societies may need in allparts of the Empire. And, what was an indispensable condition for theadvance and development of our commerce in Manchuria, China, by treatywith us, has opened to foreign commerce the cities of Mukden, thecapital of the province of Manchuria, and An tung, an important port onthe Yalu River, on the road to Korea. The full measure of developmentwhich our commerce may rightfully expect can hardly be looked for untilthe settlement of the present abnormal state of things in the Empire;but the foundation for such development has at last been laid.I call your attention to the reduced cost in maintaining the consularservice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, as shown in theannual report of the Auditor for the State and other Departments, ascompared with the year previous. For the year under consideration theexcess of expenditures over receipts on account of the consular serviceamounted to $26,125.12, as against $96,972.50 for the year ending June30, 1902, and $147,040.16 for the year ending June 30, 1901. This isthe best showing in this respect for the consular service for the pastfourteen years, and the reduction in the cost of the service to theGovernment has been made in spite of the fact that the expenditures forthe year in question were more than $20,000 greater than for theprevious year.The rural free delivery service has been steadily extended. Theattention of the Congress is asked to the question of the compensationof the letter carriers and clerks engaged in the postal service,especially on the new rural free delivery routes. More routes have beeninstalled since the first of July last than in any like period in theDepartment\'s history. While a due regard to economy must be kept inmind in the establishment of new routes, yet the extension of the ruralfree delivery system must be continued, for reasons of sound publicpolicy. No governmental movement of recent years has resulted ingreater immediate benefit to the people of the country districts. Ruralfree delivery, taken in connection with the telephone, the bicycle, andthe trolley, accomplishes much toward lessening the isolation of farmlife and making it brighter and more attractive. In the immediate pastthe lack of just such facilities as these has driven many of the moreactive and restless young men and women from the farms to the cities;for they rebelled at loneliness and lack of mental companionship. It isunhealthy and undesirable for the cities to grow at the expense of thecountry; and rural free delivery is not only a good thing in itself,but is good because it is one of the causes which check thisunwholesome tendency towards the urban concentration of our populationat the expense of the country districts. It is for the same reason thatwe sympathize with and approve of the policy of building good roads.The movement for good roads is one fraught with the greatest benefit tothe country districts.I trust that the Congress will continue to favor in all proper ways theLouisiana Purchase Exposition. This Exposition commemorates theLouisiana purchase, which was the first great step in the expansionwhich made us a continental nation. The expedition of Lewis and Clarkacross the continent followed thereon, and marked the beginning of theprocess of exploration and colonization which thrust our nationalboundaries to the Pacific. The acquisition of the Oregon country,including the present States of Oregon and Washington, was a fact ofimmense importance in our history; first giving us our place on thePacific seaboard, and making ready the way for our ascendency in thecommerce of the greatest of the oceans. The centennial of ourestablishment upon the western coast by the expedition of Lewis andClark is to be celebrated at Portland, Oregon, by an exposition in thesummer of 1905, and this event should receive recognition and supportfrom the National Government.I call your special attention to the Territory of Alaska. The countryis developing rapidly, and it has an assured future. The mineral wealthis great and has as yet hardly been tapped. The fisheries, if wiselyhandled and kept under national control, will be a business aspermanent as any other, and of the utmost importance to the people. Theforests if properly guarded will form another great source of wealth.Portions of Alaska are fitted for farming and stock raising, althoughthe methods must be adapted to the peculiar conditions of the country.Alaska is situated in the far north; but so are Norway and Sweden andFinland; and Alaska can prosper and play its part in the New World justas those nations have prospered and played their parts in the OldWorld. Proper land laws should be enacted; and the survey of the publiclands immediately begun. Coal land laws should be provided whereby thecoal land entryman may make his location and secure patent undermethods kindred to those now prescribed for homestead and mineralentrymen. Salmon hatcheries, exclusively under Government control,should be established. The cable should be extended from Sitkawestward. Wagon roads and trails should be built, and the building ofrailroads promoted in all legitimate ways. Light houses should be builtalong the coast. Attention should be paid to the needs of the AlaskaIndians; provision should be made for an officer, with deputies, tostudy their needs, relieve their immediate wants, and help them adaptthemselves to the new conditions.The commission appointed to investigate, during the season of 1903, thecondition and needs of the Alaskan salmon fisheries, has finished itswork in the field, and is preparing a detailed report thereon. Apreliminary report reciting the measures immediately required for theprotection and preservation of the salmon industry has already beensubmitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for his attention andfor the needed action.I recommend that an appropriation be made for building light houses inHawaii, and taking possession of those already built. The Territoryshould be reimbursed for whatever amounts it has already expended forlight houses. The governor should be empowered to suspend or remove anyofficial appointed by him, without submitting the matter to thelegislature.Of our insular possessions the Philippines and Porto Rico it isgratifying to say that their steady progress has been such as to makeit unnecessary to spend much time in discussing them. Yet the Congressshould ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rests upon us tofurther in every way the welfare of these communities. The Philippinesshould be knit closer to us by tariff arrangements. It would, ofcourse, be impossible suddenly to raise the people of the islands tothe high pitch of industrial prosperity and of governmental efficiencyto which they will in the end by degrees attain; and the caution andmoderation shown in developing them have been among the main reasonswhy this development has hitherto gone on so smoothly. Scrupulous carehas been taken in the choice of governmental agents, and the entireelimination of partisan politics from the public service. The conditionof the islanders is in material things far better than ever before,while their governmental, intellectual, and moral advance has kept pacewith their material advance. No one people ever benefited anotherpeople more than we have benefited the Filipinos by taking possessionof the islands.The cash receipts of the General Land Office for the last fiscal yearwere $11,024,743.65, an increase of $4,762,816.47 over the precedingyear. Of this sum, approximately, $8,461,493 will go to the credit ofthe fund for the reclamation of arid land, making the total of thisfund, up to the 30th of June, 1903, approximately, $16,191,836.A gratifying disposition has been evinced by those having unlawfulinclosures of public land to remove their fences. Nearly two millionacres so inclosed have been thrown open on demand. In but comparativelyfew cases has it been necessary to go into court to accomplish thispurpose. This work will be vigorously prosecuted until all unlawfulinclosures have been removed.Experience has shown that in the western States themselves, as well asin the rest of the country, there is widespread conviction that certainof the public land laws and the resulting administrative practice nolonger meet the present needs. The character and uses of the remainingpublic lands differ widely from those of the public lands whichCongress had especially in view when these laws were passed. Therapidly increasing rate of disposal of the public lands is not followedby a corresponding increase in home building. There is a tendency tomass in large holdings public lands, especially timber and grazinglands, and thereby to retard settlement. I renew and emphasize myrecommendation of last year that so far as they are available foragriculture in its broadest sense, and to whatever extent they may bereclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remaining public landsshould be held rigidly for the home builder. The attention of theCongress is especially directed to the timber and stone law, thedesert land law, and the commutation clause of the homestead law, whichin their operation have in many respects conflicted with wisepublic land policy. The discussions in the Congress and elsewhere havemade it evident that there is a wide divergence of opinions betweenthose holding opposite views on these subjects; and that the opposingsides have strong and convinced representatives of weight both withinand without the Congress; the differences being not only as to mattersof opinion but as to matters of fact. In order that definiteinformation may be available for the use of the Congress, I haveappointed a commission composed of W. A. Richards, Commissioner of theGeneral Land Office; Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the Bureau of Forestryof the Department of Agriculture, and F. H. Newell, Chief Hydrographerof the Geological Survey, to report at the earliest practicable momentupon the condition, operation, and effect of the present land laws andon the use, condition, disposal, and settlement of the public lands.The commission will report especially what changes in organization,laws, regulations, and practice affecting the public lands are neededto effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands toactual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them, and to securein permanence the fullest and most effective use of the resources ofthe public lands; and it will make such other reports andrecommendations as its study of these questions may suggest. Thecommission is to report immediately upon those points concerning whichits judgment is clear; on any point upon which it has doubt it willtake the time necessary to make investigation and reach a finaljudgment.The work of reclamation of the arid lands of the West is progressingsteadily and satisfactorily under the terms of the law setting asidethe proceeds from the disposal of public lands. The corps of engineersknown as the Reclamation Service, which is conducting the surveys andexaminations, has been thoroughly organized, especial pains being takento secure under the civil service rules a body of skilled, experienced,and efficient men. Surveys and examinations are progressing throughoutthe arid States and Territories, plans for reclaiming works beingprepared and passed upon by boards of engineers before approval by theSecretary of the Interior. In Arizona and Nevada, in localities wheresuch work is pre eminently needed, construction has already been begun.In other parts of the arid West various projects are well advancedtowards the drawing up of contracts, these being delayed in part bynecessities of reaching agreements or understanding as regards rightsof way or acquisition of real estate. Most of the works contemplatedfor construction are of national importance, involving interstatequestions or the securing of stable, self supporting communities in themidst of vast tracts of vacant land. The Nation as a whole is of coursethe gainer by the creation of these homes, adding as they do to thewealth and stability of the country, and furnishing a home market forthe products of the East and South. The reclamation law, while perhapsnot ideal, appears at present to answer the larger needs for which itis designed. Further legislation is not recommended until thenecessities of change are more apparent.The study of the opportunities of reclamation of the vast extent ofarid land shows that whether this reclamation is done by individuals,corporations, or the State, the sources of water supply must beeffectively protected and the reservoirs guarded by the preservation ofthe forests at the headwaters of the streams. The engineers making thepreliminary examinations continually emphasize this need and urge thatthe remaining public lands at the headwaters of the important streamsof the West be reserved to insure permanency of water supply forirrigation. Much progress in forestry has been made during the pastyear. The necessity for perpetuating our forest resources, whether inpublic or private hands, is recognized now as never before. The demandfor forest reserves has become insistent in the West, because the Westmust use the water, wood, and summer range which only such reserves cansupply. Progressive lumbermen are striving, through forestry, to givetheir business permanence. Other great business interests are awakeningto the need of forest preservation as a business matter. TheGovernment\'s forest work should receive from the Congress heartysupport, and especially support adequate for the protection of theforest reserves against fire. The forest reserve policy of theGovernment has passed beyond the experimental stage and has reached acondition where scientific methods are essential to its successfulprosecution. The administrative features of forest reserves are atpresent unsatisfactory, being divided between three Bureaus of twoDepartments. It is therefore recommended that all matters pertaining toforest reserves, except those involving or pertaining to land titles,be consolidated in the Bureau of Forestry of the Department ofAgriculture.The cotton growing States have recently been invaded by a weevil thathas done much damage and threatens the entire cotton industry. Isuggest to the Congress the prompt enactment of such remediallegislation as its judgment may approve.In granting patents to foreigners the proper course for this country tofollow is to give the same advantages to foreigners here that thecountries in which these foreigners dwell extend in return to ourcitizens; that is, to extend the benefits of our patent laws oninventions and the like where in return the articles would bepatentable in the foreign countries concerned where an American couldget a corresponding patent in such countries.The Indian agents should not be dependent for their appointment ortenure of office upon considerations of partisan politics; the practiceof appointing, when possible, ex army officers or bondedsuperintendents to the vacancies that occur is working well. Attentionis invited to the widespread illiteracy due to lack of public schoolsin the Indian Territory. Prompt heed should be paid to the need ofeducation for the children in this Territory.In my last annual Message the attention of the Congress was called tothe necessity of enlarging the safety appliance law, and it isgratifying to note that this law was amended in important respects.With the increasing railway mileage of the country, the greater numberof men employed, and the use of larger and heavier equipment, theurgency for renewed effort to prevent the loss of life and limb uponthe railroads of the country, particularly to employees, is apparent.For the inspection of water craft and the Life Saving Service upon thewater the Congress has built up an elaborate body of protectivelegislation and a thorough method of inspection and is annuallyspending large sums of money. It is encouraging to observe that theCongress is alive to the interests of those who are employed upon ourwonderful arteries of commerce the railroads who so safely transportmillions of passengers and billions of tons of freight. The Federalinspection, of safety appliances, for which the Congress is now makingappropriations, is a service analogous to that which the Government hasupheld for generations in regard to vessels, and it is believed willprove of great practical benefit, both to railroad employees and thetraveling public. As the greater part of commerce is interstate andexclusively under the control of the Congress the needed safety anduniformity must be secured by national legislation.No other class of our citizens deserves so well of the Nation as thoseto whom the Nation owes its very being, the veterans of the civil war.Special attention is asked to the excellent work of the Pension Bureauin expediting and disposing of pension claims. During the fiscal yearending July 1, 1903, the Bureau settled 251,982 claims, an average of825 claims for each working day of the year. The number of settlementssince July 1, 1903, has been in excess of last year\'s average,approaching 1,000 claims for each working day, and it is believed thatthe work of the Bureau will be current at the close of the presentfiscal year.During the year ended June 30 last 25,566 persons were appointedthrough competitive examinations under the civil service rules. Thiswas 12,672 more than during the preceding year, and 40 per cent ofthose who passed the examinations. This abnormal growth was largelyoccasioned by the extension of classification to the ruralfree delivery service and the appointment last year of over 9,000 ruralcarriers. A revision of the civil service rules took effect on April 15last, which has greatly improved their operation. The completion of thereform of the civil service is recognized by good citizens everywhereas a matter of the highest public importance, and the success of themerit system largely depends upon the effectiveness of the rules andthe machinery provided for their enforcement. A very gratifying spiritof friendly co operation exists in all the Departments of theGovernment in the enforcement and uniform observance of both the letterand spirit of the civil service act. Executive orders of July 3, 1902;March 26, 1903, and July 8, 1903, require that appointments of allunclassified laborers, both in the Departments at Washington and in thefield service, shall be made with the assistance of the United StatesCivil Service Commission, under a system of registration to test therelative fitness of applicants for appointment or employment. Thissystem is competitive, and is open to all citizens of the United Statesqualified in respect to age, physical ability, moral character,industry, and adaptability for manual labor; except that in case ofveterans of the Civil War the element of age is omitted. This system ofappointment is distinct from the classified service and does notclassify positions of mere laborer under the civil service act andrules. Regulations in aid thereof have been put in operation in severalof the Departments and are being gradually extended in other parts ofthe service. The results have been very satisfactory, as extravagancehas been checked by decreasing the number of unnecessary positions andby increasing the efficiency of the employees remaining.The Congress, as the result of a thorough investigation of thecharities and reformatory institutions in the District of Columbia, bya joint select committee of the two Houses which made its report inMarch, 1898, created in the act approved June 6, 1900, a board ofcharities for the District of Columbia, to consist of five residents ofthe District, appointed by the President of the United States, by andwith the advice and consent of the Senate, each for a term of threeyears, to serve without compensation. President McKinley appointed fivemen who had been active and prominent in the public charities inWashington, all of whom upon taking office July 1, 1900, resigned fromthe different charities with which they had been connected. The membersof the board have been reappointed in successive years. The boardserves under the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. The boardgave its first year to a careful and impartial study of the specialproblems before it, and has continued that study every year in thelight of the best practice in public charities elsewhere. Itsrecommendations in its annual reports to the Congress through theCommissioners of the District of Columbia "for the economical andefficient administration of the charities and reformatories of theDistrict of Columbia," as required by the act creating it, have beenbased upon the principles commended by the joint select committee ofthe Congress in its report of March, 1898, and approved by the bestadministrators of public charities, and make for the desiredsystematization and improvement of the affairs under its supervision.They are worthy of favorable consideration by the Congress.The effect of the laws providing a General Staff for the Army and forthe more effective use of the National Guard has been excellent. Greatimprovement has been made in the efficiency of our Army in recentyears. Such schools as those erected at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Rileyand the institution of fall maneuver work accomplish satisfactoryresults. The good effect of these maneuvers upon the National Guard ismarked, and ample appropriation should be made to enable the guardsmenof the several States to share in the benefit. The Government should assoon as possible secure suitable permanent camp sites for militarymaneuvers in the various sections of the country. The service therebyrendered not only to the Regular Army, but to the National Guard of theseveral States, will be so great as to repay many times over therelatively small expense. We should not rest satisfied with what hasbeen done, however. The only people who are contented with a system ofpromotion by mere seniority are those who are contented with thetriumph of mediocrity over excellence. On the other hand, a systemwhich encouraged the exercise of social or political favoritism inpromotions would be even worse. But it would surely be easy to devise amethod of promotion from grade to grade in which the opinion of thehigher officers of the service upon the candidates should be decisiveupon the standing and promotion of the latter. Just such a system nowobtains at West Point. The quality of each year\'s work determines thestanding of that year\'s class, the man being dropped or graduated intothe next class in the relative position which his military superiorsdecide to be warranted by his merit. In other words, ability, energy,fidelity, and all other similar qualities determine the rank of a manyear after year in West Point, and his standing in the Army when hegraduates from West Point; but from that time on, all effort to findwhich man is best or worst, and reward or punish him accordingly, isabandoned; no brilliancy, no amount of hard work, no eagerness in theperformance of duty, can advance him, and no slackness or indifferencethat falls short of a court martial offense can retard him. Until thissystem is changed we can not hope that our officers will be of as highgrade as we have a right to expect, considering the material upon whichwe draw. Moreover, when a man renders such service as Captain Pershingrendered last spring in the Moro campaign, it ought to be possibleto reward him without at once jumping him to the grade ofbrigadier general.Shortly after the enunciation of that famous principle of Americanforeign policy now known as the "Monroe Doctrine," President Monroe, ina special Message to Congress on January 30, 1824, spoke as follows:"The Navy is the arm from which our Government will always derive mostaid in support of our rights. Every power engaged in war will know thestrength of our naval power, the number of our ships of each class,their condition, and the promptitude with which we may bring them intoservice, and will pay due consideration to that argument."I heartily congratulate the Congress upon the steady progress inbuilding up the American Navy. We can not afford a let up in this greatwork. To stand still means to go back. There should be no cessation inadding to the effective units of the fighting strength of the fleet.Meanwhile the Navy Department and the officers of the Navy are doingwell their part by providing constant service at sea under conditionsakin to those of actual warfare. Our officers and enlisted men arelearning to handle the battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats withhigh efficiency in fleet and squadron formations, and the standard ofmarksmanship is being steadily raised. The best work ashore isindispensable, but the highest duty of a naval officer is to exercisecommand at sea.The establishment of a naval base in the Philippines ought not to belonger postponed. Such a base is desirable in time of peace; in time ofwar it would be indispensable, and its lack would be ruinous. Withoutit our fleet would be helpless. Our naval experts are agreed that SubigBay is the proper place for the purpose. The national interests requirethat the work of fortification and development of a naval station atSubig Bay be begun at an early date; for under the best conditions itis a work which will consume much time.It is eminently desirable, however, that there should be provided anaval general staff on lines similar to those of the General Stafflately created for the Army. Within the Navy Department itself theneeds of the service have brought about a system under which the dutiesof a general staff are partially performed; for the Bureau ofNavigation has under its direction the War College, the Office of NavalIntelligence, and the Board of Inspection, and has been in close touchwith the General Board of the Navy. But though under the excellentofficers at their head, these boards and bureaus do good work, theyhave not the authority of a general staff, and have not sufficientscope to insure a proper readiness for emergencies. We need theestablishment by law of a body of trained officers, who shall exercisea systematic control of the military affairs of the Navy, and beauthorized advisers of the Secretary concerning it.By the act of June 28, 1902, the Congress authorized the President toenter into treaty with Colombia for the building of the canal acrossthe Isthmus of Panama; it being provided that in the event of failureto secure such treaty after the lapse of a reasonable time, recourseshould be had to building a canal through Nicaragua. It has not beennecessary to consider this alternative, as I am enabled to lay beforethe Senate a treaty providing for the building of the canal across theIsthmus of Panama. This was the route which commended itself to thedeliberate judgment of the Congress, and we can now acquire by treatythe right to construct the canal over this route. The question now,therefore, is not by which route the isthmian canal shall be built, forthat question has been definitely and irrevocably decided. The questionis simply whether or not we shall have an isthmian canal.When the Congress directed that we should take the Panama route undertreaty with Colombia, the essence of the condition, of course, referrednot to the Government which controlled that route, but to the routeitself; to the territory across which the route lay, not to the namewhich for the moment the territory bore on the map. The purpose of thelaw was to authorize the President to make a treaty with the power inactual control of the Isthmus of Panama. This purpose has beenfulfilled.In the year 1846 this Government entered into a treaty with NewGranada, the predecessor upon the Isthmus of the Republic of Colombiaand of the present Republic of Panama, by which treaty it was providedthat the Government and citizens of the United States should alwayshave free and open right of way or transit across the Isthmus of Panamaby any modes of communication that might be constructed, while in turnour Government guaranteed the perfect neutrality of the above mentionedIsthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the othersea might not be interrupted or embarrassed. The treaty vested in theUnited States a substantial property right carved out of the rights ofsovereignty and property which New Granada then had and possessed overthe said territory. The name of New Granada has passed away and itsterritory has been divided. Its successor, the Government of Colombia,has ceased to own any property in the Isthmus. A new Republic, that ofPanama, which was at one time a sovereign state, and at another time amere department of the successive confederations known as New Granadaand Columbia, has now succeeded to the rights which first one and thenthe other formerly exercised over the Isthmus. But as long as theIsthmus endures, the mere geographical fact of its existence, and thepeculiar interest therein which is required by our position, perpetuatethe solemn contract which binds the holders of the territory to respectour right to freedom of transit across it, and binds us in return tosafeguard for the Isthmus and the world the exercise of thatinestimable privilege. The true interpretation of the obligations uponwhich the United States entered in this treaty of 1846 has been givenrepeatedly in the utterances of Presidents and Secretaries of State.Secretary Cuss in 1858 officially stated the position of thisGovernment as follows:"The progress of events has rendered the interoceanic route across thenarrow portion of Central America vastly important to the commercialworld, and especially to the United States, whose possessions extendalong the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and demand the speediest andeasiest modes of communication. While the rights of sovereignty of thestates occupying this region should always be respected, we shallexpect that these rights be exercised in a spirit befitting theoccasion and the wants and circumstances that have arisen. Sovereigntyhas its duties as well as its rights, and none of these localgovernments, even if administered with more regard to the just demandsof other nations than they have been, would be permitted, in a spiritof Eastern isolation, to close the gates of intercourse on the greathighways of the world, and justify the act by the pretension that theseavenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they choose to shutthem, or, what is almost equivalent, to encumber them with such unjustrelations as would prevent their general use."Seven years later, in 1865, Mr. Seward in different communications tookthe following position:"The United States have taken and will take no interest in any questionof internal revolution in the State of Panama, or any State of theUnited States of Colombia, but will maintain a perfect neutrality inconnection with such domestic altercations. The United States will,nevertheless, hold themselves ready to protect the transit trade acrossthe Isthmus against invasion of either domestic or foreign disturbersof the peace of the State of Panama. Neither the text nor the spirit ofthe stipulation in that article by which the United States engages topreserve the neutrality of the Isthmus of Panama, imposes an obligationon this Government to comply with the requisition of the President ofthe United States of Colombia for a force to protect the Isthmus ofPanama from a body of insurgents of that country. The purpose of thestipulation was to guarantee the Isthmus against seizure or invasion bya foreign power only."Attorney General Speed, under date of November 7, 1865, advisedSecretary Seward as follows:"From this treaty it can not be supposed that New Granada invited theUnited States to become a party to the intestine troubles of thatGovernment, nor did the United States become bound to take sides in thedomestic broils of New Granada. The United States did guarantee NewGranada in the sovereignty and property over the territory. This was asagainst other and foreign governments."For four hundred years, ever since shortly after the discovery of thishemisphere, the canal across the Isthmus has been planned. For twoscore years it has been worked at. When made it is to last for theages. It is to alter the geography of a continent and the trade routesof the world. We have shown by every treaty we have negotiated orattempted to negotiate with the peoples in control of the Isthmus andwith foreign nations in reference thereto our consistent good faith inobserving our obligations; on the one hand to the peoples of theIsthmus, and on the other hand to the civilized world whose commercialrights we are safeguarding and guaranteeing by our action. We have doneour duty to others in letter and in spirit, and we have shown theutmost forbearance in exacting our own rights.Last spring, under the act above referred to, a treaty concludedbetween the representatives of the Republic of Colombia and of ourGovernment was ratified by the Senate. This treaty was entered into atthe urgent solicitation of the people of Colombia and after a body ofexperts appointed by our Government especially to go into the matter ofthe routes across the Isthmus had pronounced unanimously in favor ofthe Panama route. In drawing up this treaty every concession was madeto the people and to the Government of Colombia. We were more than justin dealing with them. Our generosity was such as to make it a seriousquestion whether we had not gone too far in their interest at theexpense of our own; for in our scrupulous desire to pay all possibleheed, not merely to the real but even to the fancied rights of ourweaker neighbor, who already owed so much to our protection andforbearance, we yielded in all possible ways to her desires in drawingup the treaty. Nevertheless the Government of Colombia not merelyrepudiated the treaty, but repudiated it in such manner as to make itevident by the time the Colombian Congress adjourned that not thescantiest hope remained of ever getting a satisfactory treaty fromthem. The Government of Colombia made the treaty, and yet when theColombian Congress was called to ratify it the vote againstratification was unanimous. It does not appear that the Government madeany real effort to secure ratification.Immediately after the adjournment of the Congress a revolution brokeout in Panama. The people of Panama had long been discontented with theRepublic of Colombia, and they had been kept quiet only by the prospectof the conclusion of the treaty, which was to them a matter of vitalconcern. When it became evident that the treaty was hopelessly lost,the people of Panama rose literally as one man. Not a shot was fired bya single man on the Isthmus in the interest of the ColombianGovernment. Not a life was lost in the accomplishment of therevolution. The Colombian troops stationed on the Isthmus, who had longbeen unpaid, made common cause with the people of Panama, and withastonishing unanimity the new Republic was started. The duty of theUnited States in the premises was clear. In strict accordance with theprinciples laid down by Secretaries Cass and Seward in the officialdocuments above quoted, the United States gave notice that it wouldpermit the landing of no expeditionary force, the arrival of whichwould mean chaos and destruction along the line of the railroad and ofthe proposed Canal, and an interruption of transit as an inevitableconsequence. The de facto Government of Panama was recognized in thefollowing telegram to Mr. Ehrman:"The people of Panama have, by apparently unanimous movement, dissolvedtheir political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumedtheir independence. When you are satisfied that a de facto government,republican in form and without substantial opposition from its ownpeople, has been established in the State of Panama, you will enterinto relations with it as the responsible government of the territoryand look to it for all due action to protect the persons and propertyof citizens of the United States and to keep open the isthmian transit,in accordance with the obligations of existing treaties governing therelations of the United States to that Territory."The Government of Colombia was notified of our action by the followingtelegram to Mr. Beaupre:"The people of Panama having, by an apparently unanimous movement,dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia andresumed their independence, and having adopted a Government of theirown, republican in form, with which the Government of the United Statesof America has entered into relations, the President of the UnitedStates, in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so longand so happily existed between the respective nations, most earnestlycommends to the Governments of Colombia and of Panama the peaceful andequitable settlement of all questions at issue between them. He holdsthat he is bound not merely by treaty obligations, but by the interestsof civilization, to see that the peaceful traffic of the world acrossthe Isthmus of Panama shall not longer be disturbed by a constantsuccession of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars."When these events happened, fifty seven years had elapsed since theUnited States had entered into its treaty with New Granada. During thattime the Governments of New Granada and of its successor, Colombia,have been in a constant state of flux. The following is a partial listof the disturbances on the Isthmus of Panama during the period inquestion as reported to us by our consuls. It is not possible to give acomplete list, and some of the reports that speak of "revolutions" mustmean unsuccessful revolutions. May 22, 1850. Outbreak; two Americanskilled. War vessel demanded to quell outbreak. October,1850. Revolutionary plot to bring about independence of the Isthmus.July 22, 1851. Revolution in four southern provinces. November 14,1851.

Revolution. January, 1901 Revolution. July,1901. Revolutionary disturbances. September, 1901. City of Colontaken by rebels. March, 1902. Revolutionary disturbances. July,1902. Revolution. The above is only a partial list of the revolutions,rebellions, insurrections, riots, and other outbreaks that haveoccurred during the period in question; yet they number 53 for the 57years. It will be noted that one of them lasted for nearly three yearsbefore it was quelled; another for nearly a year. In short, theexperience of over half a century has shown Colombia to be utterlyincapable of keeping order on the Isthmus. Only the active interferenceof the United States has enabled her to preserve so much as a semblanceof sovereignty. Had it not been for the exercise by the United Statesof the police power in her interest, her connection with the Isthmuswould have been sundered long ago. In 1856, in 1860, in 1873, in 1885,in 1901, and again in 1902, sailors and marines from United States warships were forced to land in order to patrol the Isthmus, to protectlife and property, and to see that the transit across the Isthmus waskept open. In 1861, in 1862, in 1885, and in 1900, the ColombianGovernment asked that the United States Government would land troops toprotect its interests and maintain order on the Isthmus. Perhaps themost extraordinary request is that which has just been received andwhich runs as follows:"Knowing that revolution has already commenced in Panama [an eminentColombian] says that if the Government of the United States will landtroops to preserve Colombian sovereignty, and the transit, if requestedby Colombian charge d\'affaires, this Government will declare martiallaw; and, by virtue of vested constitutional authority, when publicorder is disturbed, will approve by decree ratification of the canaltreaty as signed; or, if the Government of the United States prefers,will call extra session of the Congress with new and friendlymembers next May to approve the treaty. An eminent Colombian has theperfect confidence of vice president, he says, and if it becamenecessary will go to the Isthmus or send representatives there toadjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the peoplethere."This dispatch is noteworthy from two standpoints. Its offer ofimmediately guaranteeing the treaty to us is in sharp contrast with thepositive and contemptuous refusal of the Congress which has just closedits sessions to consider favorably such a treaty; it shows that theGovernment which made the treaty really had absolute control over thesituation, but did not choose to exercise this control. The dispatchfurther calls on us to restore order and secure Colombian supremacy inthe Isthmus from which the Colombian Government has just by its actiondecided to bar us by preventing the construction of the canal.The control, in the interest of the commerce and traffic of the wholecivilized world, of the means of undisturbed transit across the Isthmusof Panama has become of transcendent importance to the United States.We have repeatedly exercised this control by intervening in the courseof domestic dissension, and by protecting the territory from foreigninvasion. In 1853 Mr. Everett assured the Peruvian minister that weshould not hesitate to maintain the neutrality of the Isthmus in thecase of war between Peru and Colombia. In 1864 Colombia, which hasalways been vigilant to avail itself of its privileges conferred by thetreaty, expressed its expectation that in the event of war between Peruand Spain the United States would carry into effect the guaranty ofneutrality. There have been few administrations of the State Departmentin which this treaty has not, either by the one side or the other, beenused as a basis of more or less important demands. It was said by Mr.Fish in 1871 that the Department of State had reason to believe that anattack upon Colombian sovereignty on the Isthmus had, on severaloccasions, been averted by warning from this Government. In 1886, whenColombia was under the menace of hostilities from Italy in the Cerruticase, Mr. Bayard expressed the serious concern that the United Statescould not but feel, that a European power should resort to forceagainst a sister republic of this hemisphere, as to the sovereign anduninterrupted use of a part of whose territory we are guarantors underthe solemn faith of a treaty.The above recital of facts establishes beyond question: First, that theUnited States has for over half a century patiently and in good faithcarried out its obligations under the treaty of 1846; second, that whenfor the first time it became possible for Colombia to do anything inrequital of the services thus repeatedly rendered to it for fifty sevenyears by the United States, the Colombian Government peremptorily andoffensively refused thus to do its part, even though to do so wouldhave been to its advantage and immeasurably to the advantage of theState of Panama, at that time under its jurisdiction; third, thatthroughout this period revolutions, riots, and factional disturbancesof every kind have occurred one after the other in almost uninterruptedsuccession, some of them lasting for months and even for years, whilethe central government was unable to put them down or to make peacewith the rebels; fourth, that these disturbances instead of showing anysign of abating have tended to grow more numerous and more serious inthe immediate past; fifth, that the control of Colombia over theIsthmus of Panama could not be maintained without the armedintervention and assistance of the United States. In other words, theGovernment of Colombia, though wholly unable to maintain order on theIsthmus, has nevertheless declined to ratify a treaty the conclusion ofwhich opened the only chance to secure its own stability and toguarantee permanent peace on, and the construction of a canal across,the Isthmus.Under such circumstances the Government of the United States would havebeen guilty of folly and weakness, amounting in their sum to a crimeagainst the Nation, had it acted otherwise than it did when therevolution of November 3 last took place in Panama. This greatenterprise of building the interoceanic canal can not be held up togratify the whims, or out of respect to the governmental impotence, orto the even more sinister and evil political peculiarities, of peoplewho, though they dwell afar off, yet, against the wish of the actualdwellers on the Isthmus, assert an unreal supremacy over the territory.The possession of a territory fraught with such peculiar capacities asthe Isthmus in question carries with it obligations to mankind. Thecourse of events has shown that this canal can not be built by privateenterprise, or by any other nation than our own; therefore it must bebuilt by the United States.Every effort has been made by the Government of the United States topersuade Colombia to follow a course which was essentially not only toour interests and to the interests of the world, but to the interestsof Colombia itself. These efforts have failed; and Colombia, by herpersistence in repulsing the advances that have been made, has forcedus, for the sake of our own honor, and of the interest and well being,not merely of our own people, but of the people of the Isthmus ofPanama and the people of the civilized countries of the world, to takedecisive steps to bring to an end a condition of affairs which hadbecome intolerable. The new Republic of Panama immediately offered tonegotiate a treaty with us. This treaty I herewith submit. By it ourinterests are better safeguarded than in the treaty with Colombia whichwas ratified by the Senate at its last session. It is better in itsterms than the treaties offered to us by the Republics of Nicaragua andCosta Rica. At last the right to begin this great undertaking is madeavailable. Panama has done her part. All that remains is for theAmerican Congress to do its part, and forthwith this Republic willenter upon the execution of a project colossal in its size and ofwell nigh incalculable possibilities for the good of this country andthe nations of mankind.By the provisions of the treaty the United States guarantees and willmaintain the independence of the Republic of Panama. There is grantedto the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control ofa strip ten miles wide and extending three nautical miles into the seaat either terminal, with all lands lying outside of the zone necessaryfor the construction of the canal or for its auxiliary works, and withthe islands in the Bay of Panama. The cities of Panama and Colon arenot embraced in the canal zone, but the United States assumes theirsanitation and, in case of need, the maintenance of order therein; theUnited States enjoys within the granted limits all the rights, power,and authority which it would possess were it the sovereign of theterritory to the exclusion of the exercise of sovereign rights by theRepublic. All railway and canal property rights belonging to Panama andneeded for the canal pass to the United States, including any propertyof the respective companies in the cities of Panama and Colon; theworks, property, and personnel of the canal and railways are exemptedfrom taxation as well in the cities of Panama and Colon as in the canalzone and its dependencies. Free immigration of the personnel andimportation of supplies for the construction and operation of the canalare granted. Provision is made for the use of military force and thebuilding of fortifications by the United States for the protection ofthe transit. In other details, particularly as to the acquisition ofthe interests of the New Panama Canal Company and the Panama Railway bythe United States and the condemnation of private property for the usesof the canal, the stipulations of the Hay Herran treaty are closelyfollowed, while the compensation to be given for these enlarged grantsremains the same, being ten millions of dollars payable on exchange ofratifications; and, beginning nine years from that date, an annualpayment of $250,000 during the life of the convention.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The Nation continues to enjoy noteworthy prosperity. Such prosperity isof course primarily due to the high individual average of ourcitizenship, taken together with our great natural resources; but animportant factor therein is the working of our long continuedgovernmental policies. The people have emphatically expressed theirapproval of the principles underlying these policies, and their desirethat these principles be kept substantially unchanged, although ofcourse applied in a progressive spirit to meet changing conditions.The enlargement of scope of the functions of the National Governmentrequired by our development as a nation involves, of course, increaseof expense; and the period of prosperity through which the country ispassing justifies expenditures for permanent improvements far greaterthan would be wise in hard times. Battle ships and forts, publicbuildings, and improved waterways are investments which should be madewhen we have the money; but abundant revenues and a large surplusalways invite extravagance, and constant care should be taken to guardagainst unnecessary increase of the ordinary expenses of government.The cost of doing Government business should be regulated with the samerigid scrutiny as the cost of doing a private business.In the vast and complicated mechanism of our modern civilized life thedominant note is the note of industrialism; and the relations ofcapital and labor, and especially of organized capital and organizedlabor, to each other and to the public at large come second inimportance only to the intimate questions of family life. Our peculiarform of government, with its sharp division of authority between theNation and the several States, has been on the whole far moreadvantageous to our development than a more strongly centralizedgovernment. But it is undoubtedly responsible for much of thedifficulty of meeting with adequate legislation the new problemspresented by the total change in industrial conditions on thiscontinent during the last half century. In actual practice it hasproved exceedingly difficult, and in many cases impossible, to getunanimity of wise action among the various States on these subjects.From the very nature of the case this is especially true of the lawsaffecting the employment of capital in huge masses.With regard to labor the problem is no less important, but it issimpler. As long as the States retain the primary control of the policepower the circumstances must be altogether extreme which requireinterference by the Federal authorities, whether in the way ofsafeguarding the rights of labor or in the way of seeing that wrong isnot done by unruly persons who shield themselves behind the name oflabor. If there is resistance to the Federal courts, interference withthe mails, or interstate commerce, or molestation of Federal property,or if the State authorities in some crisis which they are unable toface call for help, then the Federal Government may interfere; butthough such interference may be caused by a condition of things arisingout of trouble connected with some question of labor, the interferenceitself simply takes the form of restoring order without regard to thequestions which have caused the breach of order for to keep order is aprimary duty and in a time of disorder and violence all other questionssink into abeyance until order has been restored. In the District ofColumbia and in the Territories the Federal law covers the entire fieldof government; but the labor question is only acute in populous centersof commerce, manufactures, or mining. Nevertheless, both in theenactment and in the enforcement of law the Federal Government withinits restricted sphere should set an example to the State governments,especially in a matter so vital as this affecting labor. I believe thatunder modern industrial conditions it is often necessary, and evenwhere not necessary it is yet often wise, that there should beorganization of labor in order better to secure the rights of theindividual wage worker. All encouragement should be given to any suchorganization so long as it is conducted with a due and decent regardfor the rights of others. There are in this country some labor unionswhich have habitually, and other labor unions which have often, beenamong the most effective agents in working for good citizenship and foruplifting the condition of those whose welfare should be closest to ourhearts. But when any labor union seeks improper ends, or seeks toachieve proper ends by improper means, all good citizens and moreespecially all honorable public servants must oppose the wrongdoing asresolutely as they would oppose the wrongdoing of any greatcorporation. Of course any violence, brutality, or corruption, shouldnot for one moment be tolerated. Wage workers have an entire right toorganize and by all peaceful and honorable means to endeavor topersuade their fellows to join with them in organizations. They have alegal right, which, according to circumstances, may or may not be amoral right, to refuse to work in company with men who decline to jointheir organizations. They have under no circumstances the right tocommit violence upon these, whether capitalists or wage workers, whorefuse to support their organizations, or who side with those with whomthey are at odds; for mob rule is intolerable in any form.The wage workers are peculiarly entitled to the protection and theencouragement of the law. From the very nature of their occupationrailroad men, for instance, are liable to be maimed in doing thelegitimate work of their profession, unless the railroad companies arerequired by law to make ample provision for their safety. TheAdministration has been zealous in enforcing the existing law for thispurpose. That law should be amended and strengthened. Wherever theNational Government has power there should be a stringent employer\'sliability law, which should apply to the Government itself where theGovernment is an employer of labor.In my Message to the Fifty seventh Congress, at its second session, Iurged the passage of an employer\'s liability law for the District ofColumbia. I now renew that recommendation, and further recommend thatthe Congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study ofemployer\'s liability with the view of extending the provisions of agreat and constitutional law to all employments within the scope ofFederal power.The Government has recognized heroism upon the water, and bestowsmedals of honor upon those persons who by extreme and heroic daringhave endangered their lives in saving, or endeavoring to save, livesfrom the perils of the sea in the waters over which the United Stateshas jurisdiction, or upon an American vessel. This recognition shouldbe extended to cover cases of conspicuous bravery and self sacrifice inthe saving of life in private employments under the jurisdiction of theUnited States, and particularly in the land commerce of the Nation.The ever increasing casualty list upon our railroads is a matter ofgrave public concern, and urgently calls for action by the Congress. Inthe matter of speed and comfort of railway travel our railroads give atleast as good service as those of any other nation, and there is noreason why this service should not also be as safe as human ingenuitycan make it. Many of our leading roads have been foremost in theadoption of the most approved safeguards for the protection oftravelers and employees, yet the list of clearly avoidable accidentscontinues unduly large. The passage of a law requiring the adoption ofa block signal system has been proposed to the Congress. I earnestlyconcur in that recommendation, and would also point out to the Congressthe urgent need of legislation in the interest of the public safetylimiting the hours of labor for railroad employees in train serviceupon railroads engaged in interstate commerce, and providing that onlytrained and experienced persons be employed in positions ofresponsibility connected with the operation of trains. Of coursenothing can ever prevent accidents caused by human weakness ormisconduct; and there should be drastic punishment for any railroademployee, whether officer or man, who by issuance of wrong orders or bydisobedience of orders causes disaster. The law of 1901, requiringinterstate railroads to make monthly reports of all accidents topassengers and employees on duty, should also be amended so as toempower the Government to make a personal investigation, through properofficers, of all accidents involving loss of life which seem to requireinvestigation, with a requirement that the results of suchinvestigation be made public.The safety appliance law, as amended by the act of March 2, 1903, hasproved beneficial to railway employees, and in order that itsprovisions may be properly carried out, the force of inspectorsprovided for by appropriation should be largely increased. This serviceis analogous to the Steamboat Inspection Service, and deals with evenmore important interests. It has passed the experimental stage anddemonstrated its utility, and should receive generous recognition bythe Congress.There is no objection to employees of the Government forming orbelonging to unions; but the Government can neither discriminate fornor discriminate against nonunion men who are in its employment, or whoseek to be employed under it. Moreover, it is a very grave improprietyfor Government employees to band themselves together for the purpose ofextorting improperly high salaries from the Government. Especially isthis true of those within the classified service. The letter carriers,both municipal and rural, are as a whole an excellent body of publicservants. They should be amply paid. But their payment must be obtainedby arguing their claims fairly and honorably before the Congress, andnot by banding together for the defeat of those Congressmen who refuseto give promises which they can not in conscience give. TheAdministration has already taken steps to prevent and punish abuses ofthis nature; but it will be wise for the Congress to supplement thisaction by legislation.Much can be done by the Government in labor matters merely by givingpublicity to certain conditions. The Bureau of Labor has done excellentwork of this kind in many different directions. I shall shortly laybefore you in a special message the full report of the investigation ofthe Bureau of Labor into the Colorado mining strike, as this was astrike in which certain very evil forces, which are more or less atwork everywhere under the conditions of modern industrialism, becamestartlingly prominent. It is greatly to be wished that the Departmentof Commerce and Labor, through the Labor Bureau, should compile andarrange for the Congress a list of the labor laws of the variousStates, and should be given the means to investigate and report to theCongress upon the labor conditions in the manufacturing and miningregions throughout the country, both as to wages, as to hours of labor,as to the labor of women and children, and as to the effect in thevarious labor centers of immigration from abroad. In this investigationespecial attention should be paid to the conditions of child labor andchild labor legislation in the several States. Such an investigationmust necessarily take into account many of the problems with which thisquestion of child labor is connected. These problems can be actuallymet, in most cases, only by the States themselves; but the lack ofproper legislation in one State in such a matter as child labor oftenrenders it excessively difficult to establish protective restrictionupon the work in another State having the same industries, so that theworst tends to drag down the better. For this reason, it would be wellfor the Nation at least to endeavor to secure comprehensive informationas to the conditions of labor of children in the different States. Suchinvestigation and publication by the National Government would tendtoward the securing of approximately uniform legislation of the propercharacter among the several States.When we come to deal with great corporations the need for theGovernment to act directly is far greater than in the case of labor,because great corporations can become such only by engaging ininterstate commerce, and interstate commerce is peculiarly the field ofthe General Government. It is an absurdity to expect to eliminate theabuses in great corporations by State action. It is difficult to bepatient with an argument that such matters should be left to the Statesbecause more than one State pursues the policy of creating on easyterms corporations which are never operated within that State at all,but in other States whose laws they ignore. The National Governmentalone can deal adequately with these great corporations. To try to dealwith them in an intemperate, destructive, or demagogic spirit would, inall probability, mean that nothing whatever would be accomplished, and,with absolute certainty, that if anything were accomplished it would beof a harmful nature. The American people need to continue to show thevery qualities that they have shown that is, moderation, good sense,the earnest desire to avoid doing any damage, and yet the quietdetermination to proceed, step by step, without halt and without hurry,in eliminating or at least in minimizing whatever of mischief or evilthere is to interstate commerce in the conduct of great corporations.They are acting in no spirit of hostility to wealth, either individualor corporate. They are not against the rich man any more than againstthe poor man. On the contrary, they are friendly alike toward rich manand toward poor man, provided only that each acts in a spirit ofjustice and decency toward his fellows. Great corporations arenecessary, and only men of great and singular mental power can managesuch corporations successfully, and such men must have great rewards.But these corporations should be managed with due regard to theinterest of the public as a whole. Where this can be done under thepresent laws it must be done. Where these laws come short others shouldbe enacted to supplement them.Yet we must never forget the determining factor in every kind of work,of head or hand, must be the man\'s own good sense, courage, andkindliness. More important than any legislation is the gradual growthof a feeling of responsibility and forbearance among capitalists, andwage workers alike; a feeling of respect on the part of each man forthe rights of others; a feeling of broad community of interest, notmerely of capitalists among themselves, and of wage workers amongthemselves, but of capitalists and wage workers in their relations toeach other, and of both in their relations to their fellows who withthem make up the body politic. There are many captains of industry,many labor leaders, who realize this. A recent speech by the presidentof one of our great railroad systems to the employees of that systemcontains sound common sense. It rims in part as follows:"It is my belief we can better serve each other, better understand theman as well as his business, when meeting face to face, exchangingviews, and realizing from personal contact we serve but one interest,that of our mutual prosperity."Serious misunderstandings can not occur where personal good willexists and opportunity for personal explanation is present."In my early business life I had experience with men of affairs of acharacter to make me desire to avoid creating a like feeling ofresentment to myself and the interests in my charge, should fortuneever place me in authority, and I am solicitous of a measure ofconfidence on the part of the public and our employees that I shallhope may be warranted by the fairness and good fellowship I intendshall prevail in our relationship."But do not feel I am disposed to grant unreasonable requests, spendthe money of our company unnecessarily or without value received, norexpect the days of mistakes are disappearing, or that cause forcomplaint will not continually occur; simply to correct such abuses asmay be discovered, to better conditions as fast as reasonably may beexpected, constantly striving, with varying success, for thatimprovement we all desire, to convince you there is a force at work inthe right direction, all the time making progress is the dispositionwith which I have come among you, asking your good will andencouragement."The day has gone by when a corporation can be handled successfully indefiance of the public will, even though that will be unreasonable andwrong. A public may be led, but not driven, and I prefer to go with itand shape or modify, in a measure, its opinion, rather than be sweptfrom my bearings, with loss to myself and the interests in my charge."Violent prejudice exists towards corporate activity and capital today,much of it founded in reason, more in apprehension, and a large measureis due to the personal traits of arbitrary, unreasonable, incompetent,and offensive men in positions of authority. The accomplishment ofresults by indirection, the endeavor to thwart the intention, if notthe expressed letter of the law (the will of the people), a disregardof the rights of others, a disposition to withhold what is due, toforce by main strength or inactivity a result not justified, dependingupon the weakness of the claimant and his indisposition to becomeinvolved in litigation, has created a sentiment harmful in the extremeand a disposition to consider anything fair that gives gain to theindividual at the expense of the company."If corporations are to continue to do the world\'s work, as they arebest fitted to, these qualities in their representatives that haveresulted in the present prejudice against them must be relegated to thebackground. The corporations must come out into the open and see and beseen. They must take the public into their confidence and ask for whatthey want, and no more, and be prepared to explain satisfactorily whatadvantage will accrue to the public if they are given their desires;for they are permitted to exist not that they may make money solely,but that they may effectively serve those from whom they derive theirpower."Publicity, and not secrecy, will win hereafter, and laws be construedby their intent and not by their letter, otherwise public utilitieswill be owned and operated by the public which created them, eventhough the service be less efficient and the result less satisfactoryfrom a financial standpoint."The Bureau of Corporations has made careful preliminary investigationof many important corporations. It will make a special report on thebeef industry.The policy of the Bureau is to accomplish the purposes of its creationby co operation, not antagonism; by making constructive legislation,not destructive prosecution, the immediate object of its inquiries; byconservative investigation of law and fact, and by refusal to issueincomplete and hence necessarily inaccurate reports. Its policy beingthus one of open inquiry into, and not attack upon, business, theBureau has been able to gain not only the confidence, but, betterstill, the cooperation of men engaged in legitimate business.The Bureau offers to the Congress the means of getting at the cost ofproduction of our various great staples of commerce.Of necessity the careful investigation of special corporations willafford the Commissioner knowledge of certain business facts, thepublication of which might be an improper infringement of privaterights. The method of making public the results of these investigationsaffords, under the law, a means for the protection of private rights.The Congress will have all facts except such as would give to anothercorporation information which would injure the legitimate business of acompetitor and destroy the incentive for individual superiority andthrift.The Bureau has also made exhaustive examinations into the legalcondition under which corporate business is carried on in the variousStates; into all judicial decisions on the subject; and into thevarious systems of corporate taxation in use. I call special attentionto the report of the chief of the Bureau; and I earnestly ask that theCongress carefully consider the report and recommendations of theCommissioner on this subject.The business of insurance vitally affects the great mass of the peopleof the United States and is national and not local in its application.It involves a multitude of transactions among the people of thedifferent States and between American companies and foreigngovernments. I urge that the Congress carefully consider whether thepower of the Bureau of Corporations can not constitutionally beextended to cover interstate transactions in insurance.Above all else, we must strive to keep the highways of commerce open toall on equal terms; and to do this it is necessary to put a completestop to all rebates. Whether the shipper or the railroad is to blamemakes no difference; the rebate must be stopped, the abuses of theprivate car and private terminal track and side track systems must bestopped, and the legislation of the Fifty eighth Congress whichdeclares it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer,grant, give, solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, ordiscrimination in respect of the transportation of any property ininterstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by anydevice whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in thetariffs published by the carrier must be enforced. For some time afterthe enactment of the Act to Regulate Commerce it remained a mootedquestion whether that act conferred upon the Interstate CommerceCommission the power, after it had found a challenged rate to beunreasonable, to declare what thereafter should, prima facie, be thereasonable maximum rate for the transportation in dispute. The SupremeCourt finally resolved that question in the negative, so that as thelaw now stands the Commission simply possess the bare power to denouncea particular rate as unreasonable. While I am of the opinion that atpresent it would be undesirable, if it were not impracticable, finallyto clothe the Commission with general authority to fix railroad rates,I do believe that, as a fair security to shippers, the Commissionshould be vested with the power, where a given rate has been challengedand after full hearing found to be unreasonable, to decide, subject tojudicial review, what shall be a reasonable rate to take its place; theruling of the Commission to take effect immediately, and to obtainunless and until it is reversed by the court of review. The Governmentmust in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of therailways engaged in interstate commerce; and such increased supervisionis the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the onehand or a still more radical policy on the other. In my judgment themost important legislative act now needed as regards the regulation ofcorporations is this act to confer on the Interstate CommerceCommission the power to revise rates and regulations, the revised rateto at once go into effect, and stay in effect unless and until thecourt of review reverses it.Steamship companies engaged in interstate commerce and protected in ourcoastwise trade should be held to a strict observance of the interstatecommerce act.In pursuing the set plan to make the city of Washington an example toother American municipalities several points should be kept in mind bythe legislators. In the first place, the people of this country shouldclearly understand that no amount of industrial prosperity, and aboveall no leadership in international industrial competition, can in anyway atone for the sapping of the vitality of those who are usuallyspoken of as the working classes. The farmers, the mechanics, theskilled and unskilled laborers, the small shop keepers, make up thebulk of the population of any country; and upon their well being,generation after generation, the well being of the country and the racedepends. Rapid development in wealth and industrial leadership is agood thing, but only if it goes hand in hand with improvement, and notdeterioration, physical and moral. The over crowding of cities and thedraining of country districts are unhealthy and even dangerous symptomsin our modern life. We should not permit overcrowding in cities. Incertain European cities it is provided by law that the population oftowns shall not be allowed to exceed a very limited density for a givenarea, so that the increase in density must be continually pushed backinto a broad zone around the center of the town, this zone having greatavenues or parks within it. The death rate statistics show a terribleincrease in mortality, and especially in infant mortality, inovercrowded tenements. The poorest families in tenement houses live inone room, and it appears that in these one room tenements the averagedeath rate for a number of given cities at home and abroad is abouttwice what it is in a two room tenement, four times what it is in athree room tenement, and eight times what it is in a tenementconsisting of four rooms or over. These figures vary somewhat fordifferent cities, but they approximate in each city those given above;and in all cases the increase of mortality, and especially of infantmortality, with the decrease in the number of rooms used by the familyand with the consequent overcrowding is startling. The slum exacts aheavy total of death from those who dwell therein; and this is the casenot merely in the great crowded slums of high buildings in New York andChicago, but in the alley slums of Washington. In Washington people cannot afford to ignore the harm that this causes. No Christian andcivilized community can afford to show a happy go lucky lack of concernfor the youth of to day; for, if so, the community will have to pay aterrible penalty of financial burden and social degradation in theto morrow. There should be severe child labor and factory inspectionlaws. It is very desirable that married women should not work infactories. The prime duty of the man is to work, to be the breadwinner;the prime duty of the woman is to be the mother, the housewife. Allquestions of tariff and finance sink into utter insignificance whencompared with the tremendous, the vital importance of trying to shapeconditions so that these two duties of the man and of the woman can befulfilled under reasonably favorable circumstances. If a race does nothave plenty of children, or if the children do not grow up, or if whenthey grow up they are unhealthy in body and stunted or vicious in mind,then that race is decadent, and no heaping up of wealth, no splendor ofmomentary material prosperity, can avail in any degree as offsets.  TheCongress has the same power of legislation for the District of Columbiawhich the State legislatures have for the various States. The problemsincident to our highly complex modern industrial civilization, with itsmanifold and perplexing tendencies both for good and for evil, are farless sharply accentuated in the city of Washington than in most othercities. For this very reason it is easier to deal with the variousphases of these problems in Washington, and the District of Columbiagovernment should be a model for the other municipal governments of theNation, in all such matters as supervision of the housing of the poor,the creation of small parks in the districts inhabited by the poor, inlaws affecting labor, in laws providing for the taking care of thechildren, in truant laws, and in providing schools.In the vital matter of taking care of children, much advantage could begained by a careful study of what has been accomplished in such Statesas Illinois and Colorado by the juvenile courts. The work of thejuvenile court is really a work of character building. It is nowgenerally recognized that young boys and young girls who go wrongshould not be treated as criminals, not even necessarily as needingreformation, but rather as needing to have their characters formed, andfor this end to have them tested and developed by a system ofprobation. Much admirable work has been done in many of ourCommonwealths by earnest men and women who have made a special study ofthe needs of those classes of children which furnish the greatestnumber of juvenile offenders, and therefore the greatest number ofadult offenders; and by their aid, and by profiting by the experiencesof the different States and cities in these matters, it would be easyto provide a good code for the District of Columbia.Several considerations suggest the need for a systematic investigationinto and improvement of housing conditions in Washington. The hiddenresidential alleys are breeding grounds of vice and disease, and shouldbe opened into minor streets. For a number of years influentialcitizens have joined with the District Commissioners in the vainendeavor to secure laws permitting the condemnation of insanitarydwellings. The local death rates, especially from preventable diseases,are so unduly high as to suggest that the exceptional wholesomeness ofWashington\'s better sections is offset by bad conditions in her poorerneighborhoods. A special "Commission on Housing and Health Conditionsin the National Capital" would not only bring about the reformation ofexisting evils, but would also formulate an appropriate building codeto protect the city from mammoth brick tenements and other evils whichthreaten to develop here as they have in other cities. That theNation\'s Capital should be made a model for other municipalities is anideal which appeals to all patriotic citizens everywhere, and such aspecial Commission might map out and organize the city\'s futuredevelopment in lines of civic social service, just as Major L\'Enfantand the recent Park Commission planned the arrangement of her streetsand parks.It is mortifying to remember that Washington has no compulsory schoolattendance law and that careful inquiries indicate the habitual absencefrom school of some twenty per cent of all children between the ages ofeight and fourteen. It must be evident to all who consider the problemsof neglected child life or the benefits of compulsory education inother cities that one of the most urgent needs of the National Capitalis a law requiring the school attendance of all children, this law tobe enforced by attendance agents directed by the board of education.Public play grounds are necessary means for the development ofwholesome citizenship in modern cities. It is important that the workinaugurated here through voluntary efforts should be taken up andextended through Congressional appropriation of funds sufficient toequip and maintain numerous convenient small play grounds upon landwhich can be secured without purchase or rental. It is also desirablethat small vacant places be purchased and reserved as small park playgrounds in densely settled sections of the city which now have nopublic open spaces and are destined soon to be built up solidly. Allthese needs should be met immediately. To meet them would entailexpenses; but a corresponding saving could be made by stopping thebuilding of streets and levelling of ground for purposes largelyspeculative in outlying parts of the city.There are certain offenders, whose criminality takes the shape ofbrutality and cruelty towards the weak, who need a special type ofpunishment. The wife beater, for example, is inadequately punished byimprisonment; for imprisonment may often mean nothing to him, while itmay cause hunger and want to the wife and children who have been thevictims of his brutality. Probably some form of corporal punishmentwould be the most adequate way of meeting this kind of crime.The Department of Agriculture has grown into an educational institutionwith a faculty of two thousand specialists making research into all thesciences of production. The Congress appropriates, directly andindirectly, six millions of dollars annually to carry on this work. Itreaches every State and Territory in the Union and the islands of thesea lately come under our flag. Co operation is had with the Stateexperiment stations, and with many other institutions and individuals.The world is carefully searched for new varieties of grains, fruits,grasses, vegetables, trees, and shrubs, suitable to various localitiesin our country; and marked benefit to our producers has resulted.The activities of our age in lines of research have reached the tillersof the soil and inspired them with ambition to know more of theprinciples that govern the forces of nature with which they have todeal. Nearly half of the people of this country devote their energiesto growing things from the soil. Until a recent date little has beendone to prepare these millions for their life work. In most lines ofhuman activity college trained men are the leaders. The farmer had noopportunity for special training until the Congress made provision forit forty years ago. During these years progress has been made andteachers have been prepared. Over five thousand students are inattendance at our State agricultural colleges. The Federal Governmentexpends ten millions of dollars annually toward this education and forresearch in Washington and in the several States and Territories. TheDepartment of Agriculture has given facilities for post graduate workto five hundred young men during the last seven years, preparing themfor advance lines of work in the Department and in the Stateinstitutions.The facts concerning meteorology and its relations to plant and animallife are being systematically inquired into. Temperature and moistureare controlling factors in all agricultural operations. The seasons ofthe cyclones of the Caribbean Sea and their paths are being forecastedwith increasing accuracy. The cold winds that come from the north areanticipated and their times and intensity told to farmers, gardeners,and fruiterers in all southern localities.We sell two hundred and fifty million dollars\' worth of animals andanimal products to foreign countries every year, in addition tosupplying our own people more cheaply and abundantly than any othernation is able to provide for its people. Successful manufacturingdepends primarily on cheap food, which accounts to a considerableextent for our growth in this direction. The Department of Agriculture,by careful inspection of meats, guards the health of our people andgives clean bills of health to deserving exports; it is prepared todeal promptly with imported diseases of animals, and maintain theexcellence of our flocks and herds in this respect. There should be anannual census of the live stock of the Nation.We sell abroad about six hundred million dollars\' worth of plants andtheir products every year. Strenuous efforts are being made to importfrom foreign countries such grains as are suitable to our varyinglocalities. Seven years ago we bought three fourths of our rice; byhelping the rice growers on the Gulf coast to secure seeds from theOrient suited to their conditions, and by giving them adequateprotection, they now supply home demand and export to the islands ofthe Caribbean Sea and to other rice growing countries. Wheat and othergrains have been imported from light rainfall countries to our lands inthe West and Southwest that have not grown crops because of lightprecipitation, resulting in an extensive addition to our cropping areaand our home making territory that can not be irrigated. Ten millionbushels of first class macaroni wheat were grown from theseexperimental importations last year. Fruits suitable to our soils andclimates are being imported from all the countries of the OldWorld the fig from Turkey, the almond from Spain, the date fromAlgeria, the mango from India. We are helping our fruit growers to gettheir crops into European markets by studying methods of preservationthrough refrigeration, packing, and handling, which have been quitesuccessful. We are helping our hop growers by importing varieties thatripen earlier and later than the kinds they have been raising, therebylengthening the harvesting season. The cotton crop of the country isthreatened with root rot, the bollworm, and the boll weevil. Ourpathologists will find immune varieties that will resist the rootdisease, and the bollworm can be dealt with, but the boll weevil is aserious menace to the cotton crop. It is a Central American insect thathas become acclimated in Texas and has done great damage. A scientistof the Department of Agriculture has found the weevil at home inGuatemala being kept in check by an ant, which has been brought to ourcotton fields for observation. It is hoped that it may serve a goodpurpose.The soils of the country are getting attention from the farmer\'sstandpoint, and interesting results are following. We have duplicatesof the soils that grow the wrapper tobacco in Sumatra and the fillertobacco in Cuba. It will be only a question of time when the largeamounts paid to these countries will be paid to our own people. Thereclamation of alkali lands is progressing, to give object lessons toour people in methods by which worthless lands may be made productive.The insect friends and enemies of the farmer are getting attention. Theenemy of the San Jose scale was found near the Great Wall of China, andis now cleaning up all our orchards. The fig fertilizing insectimported from Turkey has helped to establish an industry in Californiathat amounts to from fifty to one hundred tons of dried figs annually,and is extending over the Pacific coast. A parasitic fly from SouthAfrica is keeping in subjection the black scale, the worst pest of theorange and lemon industry in California.Careful preliminary work is being done towards producing our own silk.The mulberry is being distributed in large numbers, eggs are beingimported and distributed, improved reels were imported from Europe lastyear, and two expert reelers were brought to Washington to reel thecrop of cocoons and teach the art to our own people.The crop reporting system of the Department of Agriculture is beingbrought closer to accuracy every year. It has two hundred and fiftythousand reporters selected from people in eight vocations in life. Ithas arrangements with most European countries for interchange ofestimates, so that our people may know as nearly as possible with whatthey must compete.During the two and a half years that have elapsed since the passage ofthe reclamation act rapid progress has been made in the surveys andexaminations of the opportunities for reclamation in the thirteenStates and three Territories of the arid West. Construction has alreadybeen begun on the largest and most important of the irrigation works,and plans are being completed for works which will utilize the fundsnow available. The operations are being carried on by the ReclamationService, a corps of engineers selected through competitivecivil service examinations. This corps includes experienced consultingand constructing engineers as well as various experts in mechanical andlegal matters, and is composed largely of men who have spent most oftheir lives in practical affairs connected with irrigation. The largerproblems have been solved and it now remains to execute with care,economy, and thoroughness the work which has been laid out. Allimportant details are being carefully considered by boards ofconsulting engineers, selected for their thorough knowledge andpractical experience. Each project is taken up on the ground bycompetent men and viewed from the standpoint of the creation ofprosperous homes, and of promptly refunding to the Treasury the cost ofconstruction. The reclamation act has been found to be remarkablycomplete and effective, and so broad in its provisions that a widerange of undertakings has been possible under it. At the same time,economy is guaranteed by the fact that the funds must ultimately bereturned to be used over again.It is the cardinal principle of the forest reserve policy of thisAdministration that the reserves are for use. Whatever interferes withthe use of their resources is to be avoided by every possible means.But these resources must be used in such a way as to make thempermanent.The forest policy of the Government is just now a subject of vividpublic interest throughout the West and to the people of the UnitedStates in general. The forest reserves themselves are of extreme valueto the present as well as to the future welfare of all the westernpublic land States. They powerfully affect the use and disposal of thepublic lands. They are of special importance because they preserve thewater supply and the supply of timber for domestic purposes, and sopromote settlement under the reclamation act. Indeed, they areessential to the welfare of every one of the great interests of theWest.Forest reserves are created for two principal purposes. The first is topreserve the water supply. This is their most important use. Theprincipal users of the water thus preserved are irrigation ranchers andsettlers, cities and towns to whom their municipal water supplies areof the very first importance, users and furnishers of water power, andthe users of water for domestic, manufacturing, mining, and otherpurposes. All these are directly dependent upon the forest reserves.The second reason for which forest reserves are created is to preservethe timber supply for various classes of wood users. Among the moreimportant of these are settlers under the reclamation act and otheracts, for whom a cheap and accessible supply of timber for domesticuses is absolutely necessary; miners and prospectors, who are inserious danger of losing their timber supply by fire or through exportby lumber companies when timber lands adjacent to their mines pass intoprivate ownership; lumbermen, transportation companies, builders, andcommercial interests in general.Although the wisdom of creating forest reserves is nearly everywhereheartily recognized, yet in a few localities there has beenmisunderstanding and complaint. The following statement is thereforedesirable:The forest reserve policy can be successful only when it has the fullsupport of the people of the West. It can not safely, and should not inany case, be imposed upon them against their will. But neither can weaccept the views of those whose only interest in the forest istemporary; who are anxious to reap what they have not sown and thenmove away, leaving desolation behind them. On the contrary, it iseverywhere and always the interest of the permanent settler and thepermanent business man, the man with a stake in the country, which mustbe considered and which must decide.The making of forest reserves within railroad and wagon road land grantlimits will hereafter, as for the past three years, be so managed as toprevent the issue, under the act of June 4, 1897, of base for exchangeor lieu selection (usually called scrip). In all cases where forestreserves within areas covered by land grants appear to be essential tothe prosperity of settlers, miners, or others, the Government landswithin such proposed forest reserves will, as in the recent past, bewithdrawn from sale or entry pending the completion of suchnegotiations with the owners of the land grants as will prevent thecreation of so called scrip.It was formerly the custom to make forest reserves without firstgetting definite and detailed information as to the character of landand timber within their boundaries. This method of action oftenresulted in badly chosen boundaries and consequent injustice tosettlers and others. Therefore this Administration adopted the presentmethod of first withdrawing the land from disposal, followed by carefulexamination on the ground and the preparation of detailed maps anddescriptions, before any forest reserve is created.I have repeatedly called attention to the confusion which exists inGovernment forest matters because the work is scattered among threeindependent organizations. The United States is the only one of thegreat nations in which the forest work of the Government is notconcentrated under one department, in consonance with the plainestdictates of good administration and common sense. The presentarrangement is bad from every point of view. Merely to mention it is toprove that it should be terminated at once. As I have repeatedlyrecommended, all the forest work of the Government should beconcentrated in the Department of Agriculture, where the larger part ofthat work is already done, where practically all of the trainedforesters of the Government are employed, where chiefly in Washingtonthere is comprehensive first class knowledge of the problems of thereserves acquired on the ground, where all problems relating to growthfrom the soil are already gathered, and where all the sciencesauxiliary to forestry are at hand for prompt and effectiveco operation. These reasons are decisive in themselves, but it shouldbe added that the great organizations of citizens whose interests areaffected by the forest reserves, such as the National Live StockAssociation, the National Wool Growers\' Association, the AmericanMining Congress, the national Irrigation Congress, and the NationalBoard of Trade, have uniformly, emphatically, and most of themrepeatedly, expressed themselves in favor of placing all Governmentforest work in the Department of Agriculture because of the peculiaradaptation of that Department for it. It is true, also, that the forestservices of nearly all the great nations of the world are under therespective departments of agriculture, while in but two of the smallernations and in one colony are they under the department of theinterior. This is the result of long and varied experience and itagrees fully with the requirements of good administration in our owncase.The creation of a forest service in the Department of Agriculture willhave for its important results:First. A better handling of all forest work; because it will be under asingle head, and because the vast and indispensable experience of theDepartment in all matters pertaining to the forest reserves, toforestry in general, and to other forms of production from the soil,will be easily and rapidly accessible.Second. The reserves themselves, being handled from the point of viewof the man in the field, instead of the man in the office, will be moreeasily and more widely useful to the people of the West than has beenthe case hitherto.Third. Within a comparatively short time the reserves will becomeself supporting. This is important, because continually and rapidlyincreasing appropriations will be necessary for the proper care of thisexceedingly important interest of the Nation, and they can and shouldhe offset by returns from the National forests. Under similarcircumstances the forest possessions of other great nations form animportant source of revenue to their governments.Every administrative officer concerned is convinced of the necessityfor the proposed consolidation of forest work in the Department ofAgriculture, and I myself have urged it more than once in formermessages. Again I commend it to the early and favorable considerationof the Congress. The interests of the Nation at large and of the Westin particular have suffered greatly because of the delay.I call the attention of the Congress again to the report andrecommendation of the Commission on the Public Lands forwarded by me tothe second session of the present Congress. The Commission hasprosecuted its investigations actively during the past season, and asecond report is now in an advanced stage of preparation.In connection with the work of the forest reserves I desire again tourge upon the Congress the importance of authorizing the President toset aside certain portions of these reserves or other public lands asgame refuges for the preservation of the bison, the wapiti, and otherlarge beasts once so abundant in our woods and mountains and on ourgreat plains, and now tending toward extinction. Every support shouldbe given to the authorities of the Yellowstone Park in their successfulefforts at preserving the large creatures therein; and at very littleexpense portions of the public domain in other regions which are whollyunsuited to agricultural settlement could be similarly utilized. We oweit to future generations to keep alive the noble and beautifulcreatures which by their presence add such distinctive character to theAmerican wilderness. The limits of the Yellowstone Park should beextended southwards. The Canyon of the Colorado should be made anational park; and the national park system should include the Yosemiteand as many as possible of the groves of giant trees in California.The veterans of the Civil War have a claim upon the Nation such as noother body of our citizens possess. The Pension Bureau has never in itshistory been managed in a more satisfactory manner than is now thecase.The progress of the Indians toward civilization, though not rapid, isperhaps all that could be hoped for in view of the circumstances.Within the past year many tribes have shown, in a degree greater thanever before, an appreciation of the necessity of work. This changedattitude is in part due to the policy recently pursued of reducing theamount of subsistence to the Indians, and thus forcing them, throughsheer necessity, to work for a livelihood. The policy, though severe,is a useful one, but it is to be exercised only with judgment and witha full understanding of the conditions which exist in each communityfor which it is intended. On or near the Indian reservations there isusually very little demand for labor, and if the Indians are to earntheir living and when work can not be furnished from outside (which isalways preferable), then it must be furnished by the Government.Practical instruction of this kind would in a few years result in theforming of habits of regular industry, which would render the Indian aproducer and would effect a great reduction in the cost of hismaintenance.It is commonly declared that the slow advance of the Indians is due tothe unsatisfactory character of the men appointed to take immediatecharge of them, and to some extent this is true. While the standard ofthe employees in the Indian Service shows great improvement over thatof bygone years, and while actual corruption or flagrant dishonesty isnow the rare exception, it is nevertheless the fact that the salariespaid Indian agents are not large enough to attract the best men to thatfield of work. To achieve satisfactory results the official in chargeof an Indian tribe should possess the high qualifications which arerequired in the manager of a large business, but only in exceptionalcases is it possible to secure men of such a type for these positions.Much better service, however, might be obtained from those now holdingthe places were it practicable to get out of them the best that is inthem, and this should be done by bringing them constantly into closertouch with their superior officers. An agent who has been content todraw his salary, giving in return the least possible equivalent ineffort and service, may, by proper treatment, by suggestion andencouragement, or persistent urging, be stimulated to greater effortand induced to take a more active personal interest in his work.Under existing conditions an Indian agent in the distant West may bewholly out of touch with the office of the Indian Bureau. He may verywell feel that no one takes a personal interest in him or his efforts.Certain routine duties in the way of reports and accounts are requiredof him, but there is no one with whom he may intelligently consult onmatters vital to his work, except after long delay. Such a man would begreatly encouraged and aided by personal contact with some one whoseinterest in Indian affairs and whose authority in the Indian Bureauwere greater than his own, and such contact would be certain to arouseand constantly increase the interest he takes in his work.The distance which separates the agents the workers in the field fromthe Indian Office in Washington is a chief obstacle to Indian progress.Whatever shall more closely unite these two branches of the IndianService, and shall enable them to co operate more heartily and moreeffectively, will be for the increased efficiency of the work and thebetterment of the race for whose improvement the Indian Bureau wasestablished. The appointment of a field assistant to the Commissionerof Indian Affairs would be certain to insure this good end. Such anofficial, if possessed of the requisite energy and deep interest in thework, would be a most efficient factor in bringing into closerrelationship and a more direct union of effort the Bureau in Washingtonand its agents in the field; and with the co operation of its branchesthus secured the Indian Bureau would, in measure fuller than everbefore, lift up the savage toward that self help and self reliancewhich constitute the man.In 1907 there will be held at Hampton Roads the tricentennialcelebration of the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, with which thehistory of what has now become the United States really begins. Icommend this to your favorable consideration. It is an event of primehistoric significance, in which all the people of the United Statesshould feel, and should show, great and general interest.In the Post Office Department the service has increased in efficiency,and conditions as to revenue and expenditure continue satisfactory. Theincrease of revenue during the year was $9,358,181.10, or 6.9 per cent,the total receipts amounting to $143,382,624.34. The expenditures were$152,362,116.70, an increase of about 9 per cent over the previousyear, being thus $8,979,492.36 in excess of the current revenue.Included in these expenditures was a total appropriation of$152,956,637.35 for the continuation and extension of the ruralfree delivery service, which was an increase of $4,902,237.35 over theamount expended for this purpose in the preceding fiscal year. Large asthis expenditure has been the beneficent results attained in extendingthe free distribution of mails to the residents of rural districts havejustified the wisdom of the outlay. Statistics brought down to the 1stof October, 1904, show that on that date there were 27,138 rural routesestablished, serving approximately 12,000,000 of people in ruraldistricts remote from post offices, and that there were pending at thattime 3,859 petitions for the establishment of new rural routes.Unquestionably some part of the general increase in receipts is due tothe increased postal facilities which the rural service has afforded.The revenues have also been aided greatly by amendments in theclassification of mail matter, and the curtailment of abuses of thesecond class mailing privilege. The average increase in the volume ofmail matter for the period beginning with 1902 and ending June, 1905(that portion for 1905 being estimated), is 40.47 per cent, as comparedwith 25.46 per cent for the period immediately preceding, and 15.92 forthe four year period immediately preceding that.Our consular system needs improvement. Salaries should be substitutedfor fees, and the proper classification, grading, and transfer ofconsular officers should be provided. I am not prepared to say that acompetitive system of examinations for appointment would work well; butby law it should be provided that consuls should be familiar, accordingto places for which they apply, with the French, German, or Spanishlanguages, and should possess acquaintance with the resources of theUnited States.The collection of objects of art contemplated in section 5586 of theRevised Statutes should be designated and established as a NationalGallery of Art; and the Smithsonian Institution should be authorized toaccept any additions to said collection that may be received by gift,bequest, or devise.It is desirable to enact a proper National quarantine law. It is mostundesirable that a State should on its own initiative enforcequarantine regulations which are in effect a restriction uponinterstate and international commerce. The question should properly beassumed by the Government alone. The Surgeon General of the NationalPublic Health and Marine Hospital Service has repeatedly andconvincingly set forth the need for such legislation.I call your attention to the great extravagance in printing and bindingGovernment publications, and especially to the fact that altogether toomany of these publications are printed. There is a constant tendency toincrease their number and their volume. It is an understatement to saythat no appreciable harm would be caused by, and substantial benefitwould accrue from, decreasing the amount of printing now done by atleast one half. Probably the great majority of the Government reportsand the like now printed are never read at all, and furthermore theprinting of much of the material contained in many of the remainingones serves no useful purpose whatever.The attention of the Congress should be especially given to thecurrency question, and that the standing committees on the matter inthe two Houses charged with the duty, take up the matter of ourcurrency and see whether it is not possible to secure an agreement inthe business world for bettering the system; the committees shouldconsider the question of the retirement of the greenbacks and theproblem of securing in our currency such elasticity as is consistentwith safety. Every silver dollar should be made by law redeemable ingold at the option of the holder.I especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement ofour merchant marine by appropriate legislation.The growing importance of the Orient as a field for American exportsdrew from my predecessor, President McKinley, an urgent request for itsspecial consideration by the Congress. In his message of 1898 hestated:"In this relation, as showing the peculiar volume and value of ourtrade with China and the peculiarly favorable conditions which existfor their expansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to thecommunication addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representativesby the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with itsaccompanying letter of the Secretary of State, recommending anappropriation for a commission to study the industrial and commercialconditions in the Chinese Empire and to report as to the opportunitiesfor and the obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for theraw products and manufactures of the United States. Action was nottaken thereon during the last session. I cordially urge that therecommendation receive at your hands the consideration which itsimportance and timeliness merit."In his annual message of 1889 he again called attention to thisrecommendation, quoting it, and stated further:"I now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject hassteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time shouldbe lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field forAmerican trade and enterprise."The importance of securing proper information and data with a view tothe enlargement of our trade with Asia is undiminished. Our consularrepresentatives in China have strongly urged a place for permanentdisplay of American products in some prominent trade center of thatEmpire, under Government control and management, as an effective meansof advancing our export trade therein. I call the attention of theCongress to the desirability of carrying out these suggestions.In dealing with the questions of immigration and naturalization it isindispensable to keep certain facts ever before the minds of those whoshare in enacting the laws. First and foremost, let us remember thatthe question of being a good American has nothing whatever to do with aman\'s birthplace any more than it has to do with his creed. In everygeneration from the time this Government was founded men of foreignbirth have stood in the very foremost rank of good citizenship, andthat not merely in one but in every field of American activity; whileto try to draw a distinction between the man whose parents came to thiscountry and the man whose ancestors came to it several generations backis a mere absurdity. Good Americanism is a matter of heart, ofconscience, of lofty aspiration, of sound common sense, but not ofbirthplace or of creed. The medal of honor, the highest prize to be wonby those who serve in the Army and the Navy of the United Statesdecorates men born here, and it also decorates men born in GreatBritain and Ireland, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in France, anddoubtless in other countries also. In the field of statesmanship, inthe field of business, in the field of philanthropic endeavor, it isequally true that among the men of whom we are most proud as Americansno distinction whatever can be drawn between those who themselves orwhose parents came over in sailing ship or steamer from across thewater and those whose ancestors stepped ashore into the woodedwilderness at Plymouth or at the mouth of the Hudson, the Delaware, orthe James nearly three centuries ago. No fellow citizen of ours isentitled to any peculiar regard because of the way in which he worshipshis Maker, or because of the birthplace of himself or his parents, norshould he be in any way discriminated against therefor. Each must standon his worth as a man and each is entitled to be judged solely thereby.There is no danger of having too many immigrants of the right kind. Itmakes no difference from what country they come. If they are sound inbody and in mind, and, above all, if they are of good character, sothat we can rest assured that their children and grandchildren will beworthy fellow citizens of our children and grandchildren, then weshould welcome them with cordial hospitality.But the citizenship of this country should not be debased. It is vitalthat we should keep high the standard of well being among ourwage workers, and therefore we should not admit masses of men whosestandards of living and whose personal customs and habits are such thatthey tend to lower the level of the American wage worker; and above allwe should not admit any man of an unworthy type, any man concerningwhom we can say that he will himself be a bad citizen, or that hischildren and grandchildren will detract from instead of adding to thesum of the good citizenship of the country. Similarly we should takethe greatest care about naturalization. Fraudulent naturalization, thenaturalization of improper persons, is a curse to our Government; andit is the affair of every honest voter, wherever born, to see that nofraudulent voting is allowed, that no fraud in connection withnaturalization is permitted.In the past year the cases of false, fraudulent, and impropernaturalization of aliens coming to the attention of the executivebranches of the Government have increased to an alarming degree.Extensive sales of forged certificates of naturalization have beendiscovered, as well as many cases of naturalization secured by perjuryand fraud; and in addition, instances have accumulated showing thatmany courts issue certificates of naturalization carelessly and uponinsufficient evidence.Under the Constitution it is in the power of the Congress "to establisha uniform rule of naturalization," and numerous laws have from time totime been enacted for that purpose, which have been supplemented in afew States by State laws having special application. The Federalstatutes permit naturalization by any court of record in the UnitedStates having common law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk, except thepolice court of the District of Columbia, and nearly all these courtsexercise this important function. It results that where so many courtsof such varying grades have jurisdiction, there is lack of uniformityin the rules applied in conferring naturalization. Some courts arestrict and others lax. An alien who may secure naturalization in oneplace might be denied it in another, and the intent of theconstitutional provision is in fact defeated. Furthermore, thecertificates of naturalization issued by the courts differ widely inwording and appearance, and when they are brought into use in foreigncountries, are frequently subject to suspicion.There should be a comprehensive revision of the naturalization laws.The courts having power to naturalize should be definitely named bynational authority; the testimony upon which naturalization may beconferred should be definitely prescribed; publication of impendingnaturalization applications should be required in advance of theirhearing in court; the form and wording of all certificates issuedshould be uniform throughout the country, and the courts should berequired to make returns to the Secretary of State at stated periods ofall naturalizations conferred.Not only are the laws relating to naturalization now defective, butthose relating to citizenship of the United States ought also to bemade the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable furtherlegislation. By what acts expatriation may be assumed to have beenaccomplished, how long an American citizen may reside abroad andreceive the protection of our passport, whether any degree ofprotection should be extended to one who has made the declaration ofintention to become a citizen of the United States but has not securednaturalization, are questions of serious import, involving personalrights and often producing friction between this Government and foreigngovernments. Yet upon these question our laws are silent. I recommendthat an examination be made into the subjects of citizenship,expatriation, and protection of Americans abroad, with a view toappropriate legislation.The power of the Government to protect the integrity of the electionsof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmedby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy offree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruptionof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it wouldseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicateit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery andcorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may besafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go asfar as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should includesevere penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended toinfluence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions for thepublication not only of the expenditures for nominations and electionsof all candidates but also of all contributions received andexpenditures made by political committees.No subject is better worthy the attention of the Congress than thatportion of the report of the Attorney General dealing with the longdelays and the great obstruction to justice experienced in the cases ofBeavers, Green and Gaynor, and Benson. Were these isolated and specialcases, I should not call your attention to them; but the difficultiesencountered as regards these men who have been indicted for criminalpractices are not exceptional; they are precisely similar in kind towhat occurs again and again in the case of criminals who havesufficient means to enable them to take advantage of a system ofprocedure which has grown up in the Federal courts and which amounts ineffect to making the law easy of enforcement against the man who has nomoney, and difficult of enforcement, even to the point of sometimessecuring immunity, as regards the man who has money. In criminal casesthe writ of the United States should run throughout its borders. Thewheels of justice should not be clogged, as they have been clogged inthe cases above mentioned, where it has proved absolutely impossible tobring the accused to the place appointed by the Constitution for histrial. Of recent years there has been grave and increasing complaint ofthe difficulty of bringing to justice those criminals whosecriminality, instead of being against one person in the Republic, isagainst all persons in the Republic, because it is against the Republicitself. Under any circumstance and from the very nature of the case itis often exceedingly difficult to secure proper punishment of those whohave been guilty of wrongdoing against the Government. By the time theoffender can be brought into court the popular wrath against him hasgenerally subsided; and there is in most instances very slight dangerindeed of any prejudice existing in the minds of the jury against him.At present the interests of the innocent man are amply safeguarded; butthe interests of the Government, that is, the interests of honestadministration, that is the interests of the people, are not recognizedas they should be. No subject better warrants the attention of theCongress. Indeed, no subject better warrants the attention of the benchand the bar throughout the United States.Alaska, like all our Territorial acquisitions, has proved resourcefulbeyond the expectations of those who made the purchase. It has becomethe home of many hardy, industrious, and thrifty American citizens.Towns of a permanent character have been built. The extent of itswealth in minerals, timber, fisheries, and agriculture, while great, isprobably not comprehended yet in any just measure by our people. We doknow, however, that from a very small beginning its products have grownuntil they are a steady and material contribution to the wealth of thenation. Owing to the immensity of Alaska and its location in the farnorth, it is a difficult matter to provide many things essential to itsgrowth and to the happiness and comfort of its people by privateenterprise alone. It should, therefore, receive reasonable aid from theGovernment. The Government has already done excellent work for Alaskain laying cables and building telegraph lines. This work has been donein the most economical and efficient way by the Signal Corps of theArmy.In some respects it has outgrown its present laws, while in othersthose laws have been found to be inadequate. In order to obtaininformation upon which I could rely I caused an official of theDepartment of Justice, in whose judgment I have confidence, to visitAlaska during the past summer for the purpose of ascertaining howgovernment is administered there and what legislation is actuallyneeded at present. A statement of the conditions found to exist,together with some recommendations and the reasons therefor, in which Istrongly concur, will be found in the annual report of theAttorney General. In some instances I feel that the legislationsuggested is so imperatively needed that I am moved briefly toemphasize the Attorney General\'s proposals.Under the Code of Alaska as it now stands many purely administrativepowers and duties, including by far the most important, devolve uponthe district judges or upon the clerks of the district court actingunder the direction of the judges, while the governor, upon whom thesepowers and duties should logically fall, has nothing specific to doexcept to make annual reports, issue Thanksgiving Day proclamations,and appoint Indian policemen and notaries public. I believe itessential to good government in Alaska, and therefore recommend, thatthe Congress divest the district judges and the clerks of their courtsof the administrative or executive functions that they now exercise andcast them upon the governor. This would not be an innovation; it wouldsimply conform the government of Alaska to fundamental principles,making the governorship a real instead of a merely nominal office, andleaving the judges free to give their entire attention to theirjudicial duties and at the same time removing them from a great deal ofthe strife that now embarrasses the judicial office in Alaska.I also recommend that the salaries of the district judges and districtattorneys in Alaska be increased so as to make them equal to thosereceived by corresponding officers in the United States after deductingthe difference in the cost of living; that the district attorneysshould be prohibited from engaging in private practice; that UnitedStates commissioners be appointed by the governor of the Territoryinstead of by the district judges, and that a fixed salary be providedfor them to take the place of the discredited "fee system," whichshould be abolished in all offices; that a mounted constabulary becreated to police the territory outside the limits of incorporatedtowns a vast section now wholly without police protection; and thatsome provision be made to at least lessen the oppressive delays andcosts that now attend the prosecution of appeals from the districtcourt of Alaska. There should be a division of the existing judicialdistricts, and an increase in the number of judges.Alaska should have a Delegate in the Congress. Where possible, theCongress should aid in the construction of needed wagon roads.Additional light houses should be provided. In my judgment, it isespecially important to aid in such manner as seems just and feasiblein the construction of a trunk line of railway to connect the Gulf ofAlaska with the Yukon River through American territory. This would bemost beneficial to the development of the resources of the Territory,and to the comfort and welfare of its people.Salmon hatcheries should be established in many different streams, soas to secure the preservation of this valuable food fish. Salmonfisheries and canneries should be prohibited on certain of the riverswhere the mass of those Indians dwell who live almost exclusively onfish.The Alaskan natives are kindly, intelligent, anxious to learn, andwilling to work. Those who have come under the influence ofcivilization, even for a limited period, have proved their capabilityof becoming self supporting, self respecting citizens, and ask only forthe just enforcement of law and intelligent instruction andsupervision. Others, living in more remote regions, primitive, simplehunters and fisher folk, who know only the life of the woods and thewaters, are daily being confronted with twentieth century civilizationwith all of its complexities. Their country is being overrun bystrangers, the game slaughtered and driven away, the streams depletedof fish, and hitherto unknown and fatal diseases brought to them, allof which combine to produce a state of abject poverty and want whichmust result in their extinction. Action in their interest is demandedby every consideration of justice and humanity.The needs of these people are:The abolition of the present fee system, whereby the native isdegraded, imposed upon, and taught the injustice of law.The establishment of hospitals at central points, so that contagiousdiseases that are brought to them continually by incoming whites may belocalized and not allowed to become epidemic, to spread death anddestitution over great areas.The development of the educational system in the form of practicaltraining in such industries as will assure the Indians self supportunder the changed conditions in which they will have to live.The duties of the office of the governor should be extended to includethe supervision of Indian affairs, with necessary assistants indifferent districts. He should be provided with the means and the powerto protect and advise the native people, to furnish medical treatmentin time of epidemics, and to extend material relief in periods offamine and extreme destitution.The Alaskan natives should be given the right to acquire, hold, anddispose of property upon the same conditions as given otherinhabitants; and the privilege of citizenship should be given to suchas may be able to meet certain definite requirements. In HawaiiCongress should give the governor power to remove all the officialsappointed under him. The harbor of Honolulu should be dredged. TheMarine Hospital Service should be empowered to study leprosy in theislands. I ask special consideration for the report and recommendationof the governor of Porto Rico.In treating of our foreign policy and of the attitude that this greatNation should assume in the world at large, it is absolutely necessaryto consider the Army and the Navy, and the Congress, through which thethought of the Nation finds its expression, should keep ever vividly inmind the fundamental fact that it is impossible to treat our foreignpolicy, whether this policy takes shape in the effort to secure justicefor others or justice for ourselves, save as conditioned upon theattitude we are willing to take toward our Army, and especially towardour Navy. It is not merely unwise, it is contemptible, for a nation, asfor an individual, to use high sounding language to proclaim itspurposes, or to take positions which are ridiculous if unsupported bypotential force, and then to refuse to provide this force. If there isno intention of providing and of keeping the force necessary to back upa strong attitude, then it is far better not to assume such anattitude.The steady aim of this Nation, as of all enlightened nations, should beto strive to bring ever nearer the day when there shall prevailthroughout the world the peace of justice. There are kinds of peacewhich are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructiveas any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wildernessand called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid orshortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled byfalse teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty thatwas stern and that needed self sacrifice, and have sought to hide fromtheir own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by callingthem love of peace. The peace of tyrannous terror, the peace of cravenweakness, the peace of injustice, all these should be shunned as weshun unrighteous war. The goal to set before us as a nation, the goalwhich should be set before all mankind, is the attainment of the peaceof justice, of the peace which comes when each nation is not merelysafe guarded in its own rights, but scrupulously recognizes andperforms its duty toward others. Generally peace tells forrighteousness; but if there is conflict between the two, then ourfealty is due first to the cause of righteousness. Unrighteous wars arecommon, and unrighteous peace is rare; but both should be shunned. Theright of freedom and the responsibility for the exercise of that rightcan not be divorced. One of our great poets has well and finely saidthat freedom is not a gift that tarries long in the hands of cowards.Neither does it tarry long in the hands of those too slothful, toodishonest, or too unintelligent to exercise it. The eternal vigilancewhich is the price of liberty must be exercised, sometimes to guardagainst outside foes; although of course far more often to guardagainst our own selfish or thoughtless shortcomings.If these self evident truths are kept before us, and only if they areso kept before us, we shall have a clear idea of what our foreignpolicy in its larger aspects should be. It is our duty to remember thata nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong orweak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual;that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But wemust also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guardits own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of theindividual so to do. Within the Nation the individual has now delegatedthis right to the State, that is, to the representative of all theindividuals, and it is a maxim of the law that for every wrong there isa remedy. But in international law we have not advanced by any means asfar as we have advanced in municipal law. There is as yet no judicialway of enforcing a right in international law. When one nation wrongsanother or wrongs many others, there is no tribunal before which thewrongdoer can be brought. Either it is necessary supinely to acquiescein the wrong, and thus put a premium upon brutality and aggression, orelse it is necessary for the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand up forits rights. Until some method is devised by which there shall be adegree of international control over offending nations, it would be awicked thing for the most civilized powers, for those with most senseof international obligations and with keenest and most generousappreciation of the difference between right and wrong, to disarm. Ifthe great civilized nations of the present day should completelydisarm, the result would mean an immediate recrudescence of barbarismin one form or another. Under any circumstances a sufficient armamentwould have to be kept up to serve the purposes of international police;and until international cohesion and the sense of international dutiesand rights are far more advanced than at present, a nation desirousboth of securing respect for itself and of doing good to others musthave a force adequate for the work which it feels is allotted to it asits part of the general world duty. Therefore it follows that aself respecting, just, and far seeing nation should on the one handendeavor by every means to aid in the development of the variousmovements which tend to provide substitutes for war, which tend torender nations in their actions toward one another, and indeed towardtheir own peoples, more responsive to the general sentiment of humaneand civilized mankind; and on the other hand that it should keepprepared, while scrupulously avoiding wrongdoing itself, to repel anywrong, and in exceptional cases to take action which in a more advancedstage of international relations would come under the head of theexercise of the international police. A great free people owes it toitself and to all mankind not to sink into helplessness before thepowers of evil.We are in every way endeavoring to help on, with cordial good will,every movement which will tend to bring us into more friendly relationswith the rest of mankind. In pursuance of this policy I shall shortlylay before the Senate treaties of arbitration with all powers which arewilling to enter into these treaties with us. It is not possible atthis period of the world\'s development to agree to arbitrate allmatters, but there are many matters of possible difference between usand other nations which can be thus arbitrated. Furthermore, at therequest of the Interparliamentary Union, an eminent body composed ofpractical statesmen from all countries, I have asked the Powers to joinwith this Government in a second Hague conference, at which it is hopedthat the work already so happily begun at The Hague may be carried somesteps further toward completion. This carries out the desire expressedby the first Hague conference itself.It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger orentertains any projects as regards the other nations of the WesternHemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this countrydesires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, andprosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can countupon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to actwith reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters,if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear nointerference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or animpotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilizedsociety, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require interventionby some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherenceof the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the UnitedStates, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing orimpotence, to the exercise of an international police power. If everycountry washed by the Caribbean Sea would show the progress in stableand just civilization which with the aid of the Platt amendment Cubahas shown since our troops left the island, and which so many of therepublics in both Americas are constantly and brilliantly showing, allquestion of interference by this Nation with their affairs would be atan end. Our interests and those of our southern neighbors are inreality identical. They have great natural riches, and if within theirborders the reign of law and justice obtains, prosperity is sure tocome to them. While they thus obey the primary laws of civilizedsociety they may rest assured that they will be treated by us in aspirit of cordial and helpful sympathy. We would interfere with themonly in the last resort, and then only if it became evident that theirinability or unwillingness to do justice at home and abroad hadviolated the rights of the United States or had invited foreignaggression to the detriment of the entire body of American nations. Itis a mere truism to say that every nation, whether in America oranywhere else, which desires to maintain its freedom, its independence,must ultimately realize that the right of such independence can not beseparated from the responsibility of making good use of it.In asserting the Monroe Doctrine, in taking such steps as we have takenin regard to Cuba, Venezuela, and Panama, and in endeavoring tocircumscribe the theater of war in the Far East, and to secure the opendoor in China, we have acted in our own interest as well as in theinterest of humanity at large. There are, however, cases in which,while our own interests are not greatly involved, strong appeal is madeto our sympathies. Ordinarily it is very much wiser and more useful forus to concern ourselves with striving for our own moral and materialbetterment here at home than to concern ourselves with trying to betterthe condition of things in other nations. We have plenty of sins of ourown to war against, and under ordinary circumstances we can do more forthe general uplifting of humanity by striving with heart and soul toput a stop to civic corruption, to brutal lawlessness and violent raceprejudices here at home than by passing resolutions about wrongdoingelsewhere. Nevertheless there are occasional crimes committed on sovast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt whether itis not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapprovalof the deed and our sympathy with those who have suffered by it. Thecases must be extreme in which such a course is justifiable. There mustbe no effort made to remove the mote from our brother\'s eye if werefuse to remove the beam from our own. But in extreme cases action maybe justifiable and proper. What form the action shall take must dependupon the circumstances of the case; that is, upon the degree of theatrocity and upon our power to remedy it. The cases in which we couldinterfere by force of arms as we interfered to put a stop tointolerable conditions in Cuba are necessarily very few. Yet it is notto be expected that a people like ours, which in spite of certain veryobvious shortcomings, nevertheless as a whole shows by its consistentpractice its belief in the principles of civil and religious libertyand of orderly freedom, a people among whom even the worst crime, likethe crime of lynching, is never more than sporadic, so that individualsand not classes are molested in their fundamental rights it isinevitable that such a nation should desire eagerly to give expressionto its horror on an occasion like that of the massacre of the Jews inKishenef, or when it witnesses such systematic and long extendedcruelty and oppression as the cruelty and oppression of which theArmenians have been the victims, and which have won for them theindignant pity of the civilized world.Even where it is not possible to secure in other nations the observanceof the principles which we accept as axiomatic, it is necessary for usfirmly to insist upon the rights of our own citizens without regard totheir creed or race; without regard to whether they were born here orborn abroad. It has proved very difficult to secure from Russia theright for our Jewish fellow citizens to receive passports and travelthrough Russian territory. Such conduct is not only unjust andirritating toward us, but it is difficult to see its wisdom fromRussia\'s standpoint. No conceivable good is accomplished by it. If anAmerican Jew or an American Christian misbehaves himself in Russia hecan at once be driven out; but the ordinary American Jew, like theordinary American Christian, would behave just about as he behaveshere, that is, behave as any good citizen ought to behave; and wherethis is the case it is a wrong against which we are entitled to protestto refuse him his passport without regard to his conduct and character,merely on racial and religious grounds. In Turkey our difficultiesarise less from the way in which our citizens are sometimes treatedthan from the indignation inevitably excited in seeing such fearfulmisrule as has been witnessed both in Armenia and Macedonia.The strong arm of the Government in enforcing respect for its justrights in international matters is the Navy of the United States. Imost earnestly recommend that there be no halt in the work ofupbuilding the American Navy. There is no more patriotic duty before usa people than to keep the Navy adequate to the needs of this country\'sposition. We have undertaken to build the Isthmian Canal. We haveundertaken to secure for ourselves our just share in the trade of theOrient. We have undertaken to protect our citizens from propertreatment in foreign lands. We continue steadily to insist on theapplication of the Monroe Doctrine to the Western Hemisphere. Unlessour attitude in these and all similar matters is to be a mere boastfulsham we can not afford to abandon our naval programme. Our voice is nowpotent for peace, and is so potent because we are not afraid of war.But our protestations upon behalf of peace would neither receive nordeserve the slightest attention if we were impotent to make them good.The war which now unfortunately rages in the far East has emphasized instriking fashion the new possibilities of naval warfare. The lessonstaught are both strategic and tactical, and are political as well asmilitary. The experiences of the war have shown in conclusive fashionthat while sea going and sea keeping torpedo destroyers areindispensable, and fast lightly armed and armored cruisers very useful,yet that the main reliance, the main standby, in any navy worthy thename must be the great battle ships, heavily armored and heavilygunned. Not a Russian or Japanese battle ship has been sunk by atorpedo boat, or by gunfire, while among the less protected ships,cruiser after cruiser has been destroyed whenever the hostile squadronshave gotten within range of one another\'s weapons. There will always bea large field of usefulness for cruisers, especially of the moreformidable type. We need to increase the number of torpedo boatdestroyers, paying less heed to their having a knot or two extra speedthan to their capacity to keep the seas for weeks, and, if necessary,for months at a time. It is wise to build submarine torpedo boats, asunder certain circumstances they might be very useful. But most of allwe need to continue building our fleet of battle ships, or ships sopowerfully armed that they can inflict the maximum of damage upon ouropponents, and so well protected that they can suffer a severehammering in return without fatal impairment of their ability to fightand maneuver. Of course ample means must be provided for enabling thepersonnel of the Navy to be brought to the highest point of efficiency.Our great fighting ships and torpedo boats must be ceaselessly trainedand maneuvered in squadrons. The officers and men can only learn theirtrade thoroughly by ceaseless practice on the high seas. In the eventof war it would be far better to have no ships at all than to haveships of a poor and ineffective type, or ships which, however good,were yet manned by untrained and unskillful crews. The best officersand men in a poor ship could do nothing against fairly good opponents;and on the other hand a modern war ship is useless unless the officersand men aboard her have become adepts in their duties. The marksmanshipin our Navy has improved in an extraordinary degree during the lastthree years, and on the whole the types of our battleships areimproving; but much remains to be done. Sooner or later we shall haveto provide for some method by which there will be promotions for meritas well as for seniority, or else retirement all those who after acertain age have not advanced beyond a certain grade; while no effortmust be spared to make the service attractive to the enlisted men inorder that they may be kept as long as possible in it. Reservationpublic schools should be provided wherever there are navy yards.Within the last three years the United States has set an example indisarmament where disarmament was proper. By law our Army is fixed at amaximum of one hundred thousand and a minimum of sixty thousand men.When there was insurrection in the Philippines we kept the Army at themaximum. Peace came in the Philippines, and now our Army has beenreduced to the minimum at which it is possible to keep it with dueregard to its efficiency. The guns now mounted require twenty eightthousand men, if the coast fortifications are to be adequately manned.Relatively to the Nation, it is not now so large as the police force ofNew York or Chicago relatively to the population of either city. Weneed more officers; there are not enough to perform the regular armywork. It is very important that the officers of the Army should beaccustomed to handle their men in masses, as it is also important thatthe National Guard of the several States should be accustomed to actualfield maneuvering, especially in connection with the regulars. For thisreason we are to be congratulated upon the success of the fieldmaneuvers at Manassas last fall, maneuvers in which a larger number ofRegulars and National Guard took part than was ever before assembledtogether in time of peace. No other civilized nation has, relatively toits population, such a diminutive Army as ours; and while the Army isso small we are not to be excused if we fail to keep it at a very highgrade of proficiency. It must be incessantly practiced; the standardfor the enlisted men should be kept very high, while at the same timethe service should be made as attractive as possible; and the standardfor the officers should be kept even higher which, as regards theupper ranks, can best be done by introducing some system of selectionand rejection into the promotions. We should be able, in the event ofsome sudden emergency, to put into the field one first class armycorps, which should be, as a whole, at least the equal of any body oftroops of like number belonging to any other nation.Great progress has been made in protecting our coasts by adequatefortifications with sufficient guns. We should, however, pay much moreheed than at present to the development of an extensive system offloating mines for use in all our more important harbors. These mineshave been proved to be a most formidable safeguard against hostilefleets.I earnestly call the attention of the Congress to the need of amendingthe existing law relating to the award of Congressional medals of honorin the Navy so as to provide that they may be awarded to commissionedofficers and warrant officers as well as to enlisted men. These justlyprized medals are given in the Army alike to the officers and theenlisted men, and it is most unjust that the commissioned officers andwarrant officers of the Navy should not in this respect have the samerights as their brethren in the Army and as the enlisted men of theNavy.In the Philippine Islands there has been during the past year acontinuation of the steady progress which has obtained ever since ourtroops definitely got the upper hand of the insurgents. The Philippinepeople, or, to speak more accurately, the many tribes, and even races,sundered from one another more or less sharply, who go to make up thepeople of the Philippine Islands, contain many elements of good, andsome elements which we have a right to hope stand for progress. Atpresent they are utterly incapable of existing in independence at allor of building up a civilization of their own. I firmly believe that wecan help them to rise higher and higher in the scale of civilizationand of capacity for self government, and I most earnestly hope that inthe end they will be able to stand, if not entirely alone, yet in somesuch relation to the United States as Cuba now stands. This end is notyet in sight, and it may be indefinitely postponed if our people arefoolish enough to turn the attention of the Filipinos away from theproblems of achieving moral and material prosperity, of working for astable, orderly, and just government, and toward foolish and dangerousintrigues for a complete independence for which they are as yet totallyunfit.On the other hand our people must keep steadily before their minds thefact that the justification for our stay in the Philippines mustultimately rest chiefly upon the good we are able to do in the islands.I do not overlook the fact that in the development of our interests inthe Pacific Ocean and along its coasts, the Philippines have played andwill play an important part; and that our interests have been served inmore than one way by the possession of the islands. But our chiefreason for continuing to hold them must be that we ought in good faithto try to do our share of the world\'s work, and this particular pieceof work has been imposed upon us by the results of the war with Spain.The problem presented to us in the Philippine Islands is akin to, butnot exactly like, the problems presented to the other great civilizedpowers which have possessions in the Orient. There are points ofresemblance in our work to the work which is being done by the Britishin India and Egypt, by the French in Algiers, by the Dutch in Java, bythe Russians in Turkestan, by the Japanese in Formosa; but moredistinctly than any of these powers we are endeavoring to develop thenatives themselves so that they shall take an ever increasing share intheir own government, and as far as is prudent we are already admittingtheir representatives to a governmental equality with our own. Thereare commissioners, judges, and governors in the islands who areFilipinos and who have exactly the same share in the government of theislands as have their colleagues who are Americans, while in the lowerranks, of course, the great majority of the public servants areFilipinos. Within two years we shall be trying the experiment of anelective lower house in the Philippine legislature. It may be that theFilipinos will misuse this legislature, and they certainly will misuseit if they are misled by foolish persons here at home into starting anagitation for their own independence or into any factious or improperaction. In such case they will do themselves no good and will stop forthe time being all further effort to advance them and give them agreater share in their own government. But if they act with wisdom andself restraint, if they show that they are capable of electing alegislature which in its turn is capable of taking a sane and efficientpart in the actual work of government, they can rest assured that afull and increasing measure of recognition will be given them. Aboveall they should remember that their prime needs are moral andindustrial, not political. It is a good thing to try the experiment ofgiving them a legislature; but it is a far better thing to give themschools, good roads, railroads which will enable them to get theirproducts to market, honest courts, an honest and efficientconstabulary, and all that tends to produce order, peace, fair dealingas between man and man, and habits of intelligent industry and thrift.If they are safeguarded against oppression, and if their real wants,material and spiritual, are studied intelligently and in a spirit offriendly sympathy, much more good will be done them than by any effortto give them political power, though this effort may in its own propertime and place be proper enough.Meanwhile our own people should remember that there is need for thehighest standard of conduct among the Americans sent to the PhilippineIslands, not only among the public servants but among the privateindividuals who go to them. It is because I feel this so deeply that inthe administration of these islands I have positively refused to permitany discrimination whatsoever for political reasons and have insistedthat in choosing the public servants consideration should be paidsolely to the worth of the men chosen and to the needs of the islands.There is no higher body of men in our public service than we have inthe Philippine Islands under Governor Wright and his associates. So faras possible these men should be given a free hand, and theirsuggestions should receive the hearty backing both of the Executive andof the Congress. There is need of a vigilant and disinterested supportof our public servants in the Philippines by good citizens here in theUnited States. Unfortunately hitherto those of our people here at homewho have specially claimed to be the champions of the Filipinos have inreality been their worst enemies. This will continue to be the case aslong as they strive to make the Filipinos independent, and stop allindustrial development of the islands by crying out against the lawswhich would bring it on the ground that capitalists must not "exploit"the islands. Such proceedings are not only unwise, but are most harmfulto the Filipinos, who do not need independence at all, but who do needgood laws, good public servants, and the industrial development thatcan only come if the investment, of American and foreign capital in theislands is favored in all legitimate ways.Every measure taken concerning the islands should be taken primarilywith a view to their advantage. We should certainly give them lowertariff rates on their exports to the United States; if this is not doneit will be a wrong to extend our shipping laws to them. I earnestlyhope for the immediate enactment into law of the legislation nowpending to encourage American capital to seek investment in the islandsin railroads, in factories, in plantations, and in lumbering andmining.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity.Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebband flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community,both by the deserving and the undeserving. Against the wrath of theLord the wisdom of man cannot avail; in time of flood or drought humaningenuity can but partially repair the disaster. A general failure ofcrops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars the generalwell being, then those who are innocent of the folly will have to paypart of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. Apanic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the businesscommunity would hurt the whole business community. But such stoppage ofwelfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the longrun the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country isthe high individual character of the average American worker, theaverage American citizen, no matter whether his work be mental ormanual, whether he be farmer or wage worker, business man orprofessional man.In our industrial and social system the interests of all men are soclosely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases astraight dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity andindustry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the manof great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor ofmany other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they couldproduce without his guidance; and both he and they share in thebenefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial factthat the sharing may be unequal must never blind us to the underlyingfact that there is this sharing, and that the benefit comes in somedegree to each man concerned. Normally the wage worker, the man ofsmall means, and the average consumer, as well as the average producer,are all alike helped by making conditions such that the man ofexceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for hisability. Something can be done by legislation to help the generalprosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character canbe given to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of apolicy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious andefficient people who act decently; and this is only another way ofsaying that any benefit which comes to the less able and less fortunatemust of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate.If, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his morefortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they haveboth, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be thatwhile danger may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an evenheavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we must allgo up or down together.Yet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is alsotrue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision someof the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for thecommon good, but in ways which tell against this common good. Thefortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, andvest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter ofnecessity to give to the sovereign that is, to the Government, whichrepresents the people as a whole some effective power of supervisionover their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy social andindustrial life, every big corporation should be held responsible by,and be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control itsconduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age ofcombination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not onlyuseless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law whichthe failure to enforce law inevitably produces. We should, moreover,recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected bycorporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth ofintellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and thereforenormally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors.The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come tostay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored solong as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it actsagainst law and justice.So long as the finances of the Nation are kept upon an honest basis noother question of internal economy with which the Congress has thepower to deal begins to approach in importance the matter ofendeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which theindividuals and especially the great corporations doing an interstatebusiness are to act. The makers of our National Constitution providedespecially that the regulation of interstate commerce should comewithin the sphere of the General Government. The arguments in favor oftheir taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are farstronger today, in view of the enormous development of great businessagencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusivelythat it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation andsupervision of these great corporations by State action. Suchregulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by asovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work ofthe corporations that is, by the National Government. I believe thatthis regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of lawby the Congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly benecessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon theNational Government by a proper amendment of the Constitution. It wouldobviously be unwise to endeavor to secure such an amendment until it iscertain that the result cannot be obtained under the Constitution as itnow is. The laws of the Congress and of the several States hitherto, aspassed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in showing that theStates have no power in the matter than that the National Governmenthas power; so that there at present exists a very unfortunate conditionof things, under which these great corporations doing an interstatebusiness occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neitherany State Government nor the National Government having effectivecontrol over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiouslyand carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert thesovereignty of the National Government by affirmative action.This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely arestoration; for from the earliest time such regulation of industrialactivities has been recognized in the action of the lawmaking bodies;and all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manneras will prevent the Commonwealth abdicating the power it has alwayspossessed not only in this country, but also in England before andsince this country became a separate Nation.It has been a misfortune that the National laws on this subject havehitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmativekind, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit whatcould not be effectively prohibited, and have in part in theirprohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not beallowed. It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint oncompetition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; andwhere it is not useless it is generally hurtful. Events have shown thatit is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law ofthis kind by incessant appeal to the courts. The Department of Justicehas for the last four years devoted more attention to the enforcementof the anti trust legislation than to anything else. Much has beenaccomplished, particularly marked has been the moral effect of theprosecutions; but it is increasingly evident that there will be a veryinsufficient beneficial result in the way of economic change. Thesuccessful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediatelydevelops another device to accomplish the same purpose. What is neededis not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, whichmay tend to restrict competition, but such adequate supervision andregulation as will prevent any restriction of competition from being tothe detriment of the public as well as such supervision and regulationas will prevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction ofcompetition. Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no meansthe only one, is overcapitalization generally itself the result ofdishonest promotion because of the myriad evils it brings in itstrain; for such overcapitalization often means an inflation thatinvites business panic; it always conceals the true relation of theprofit earned to the capital actually invested, and it creates a burdenof interest payments which is a fertile cause of improper reduction inor limitation of wages; it damages the small investor, discouragesthrift, and encourages gambling and speculation; while perhaps worst ofall is the trickiness and dishonesty which it implies for harm tomorals is worse than any possible harm to material interests, and thedebauchery of politics and business by great dishonest corporations isfar worse than any actual material evil they do the public. Until theNational Government obtains, in some manner which the wisdom of theCongress may suggest, proper control over the big corporations engagedin interstate commerce that is, over the great majority of the bigcorporations it will be impossible to deal adequately with theseevils.I am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that I amsuggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action insecuring it. I should emphatically protest against improperly radicalor hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the greatcorporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As Isaid in my message of December 6 last, the immediate and most pressingneed, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law ofsome scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervisionand regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the countryengaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectivelyprevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must includeputting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This powerto regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world,should be exercised with moderation, caution, and self restraint; butit should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised when the needarises.The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should beaffirmative and should be given to some administrative body created bythe Congress. If given to the present Interstate Commerce Commission,or to a reorganized Interstate Commerce Commission, such commissionshould be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe in theGovernment interfering with private business more than is necessary. Ido not believe in the Government undertaking any work which can withpropriety be left in private hands. But neither do I believe in theGovernment flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evidentthat abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there is governmentalsupervision. It is not my province to indicate the exact terms of thelaw which should be enacted; but I call the attention of the Congressto certain existing conditions with which it is desirable to deal, Inmy judgment the most important provision which such law should containis that conferring upon some competent administrative body the power todecide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rateprescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found tobe unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of thecomplaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not belawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonlycalled this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and toobtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. Itsometimes happens at present not that a rate is too high but that afavored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commissionwould have the right to fix this already established minimum rate asthe maximum; and it would need only one or two such decisions by thecommission to cure railroad companies of the practice of givingimproper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that myproposal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originaterates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated bythe roads, upon complaint and after investigation. A heavy penaltyshould be exacted from any corporation which fails to respect an orderof the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate asbeing essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railwayregulation. The first necessity is to secure it; and unless it isgranted to the commission there is little use in touching the subjectat all.Illegal transactions often occur under the forms of law. It has oftenoccurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy alarge quantity of some commodity and then after it has been bought anopen reduction is made in the rate to take effect immediately, thearrangement resulting to the profit of one shipper and the one railroadand to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not beforgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as anyrailroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so thatnobody can fail to understand that any kind of commission paid onfreight shipments, whether in this form or in the form of fictitiousdamages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, orpayment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whetherit would not be wise to confer on the Government the right of civilaction against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the valueof the rebate; this would help stop what is really blackmail. Elevatorallowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extentthat they are demoralizing and are used as rebates.The best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be thatregulation secured by an honest agreement among the railroadsthemselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, forinstance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper orbig railroad to discriminate against or secure advantages over somerival; and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agentsfor enforcing the law. The power vested in the Government to put a stopto agreements to the detriment of the public should, in my judgment, beaccompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and carefulsupervision, agreements clearly in the interest of the public. But, inmy judgment, the necessity for giving this further power is by no meansas great as the necessity for giving the commission or administrativebody the other powers I have enumerated above; and it may well beinadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power in the commissionor other administrative body until it already possesses and isexercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the powersI recommend as indeed the vitally important power that to fix a givenmaximum rate, which rate, after the lapse of a reasonable time, goesinto full effect, subject to review by the courts.All private car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and thelike should be expressly put under the supervision of the InterstateCommerce Commission or some similar body so far as rates, andagreements practically affecting rates, are concerned. The private carowners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fairand reasonable compensation on their investment, but neither privatecars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized asdevices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, orin mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges isjust as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate shouldapply on goods imported than actually obtains on domestic goods fromthe American seaboard to destination except in cases where watercompetition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity ofthe accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged ininterstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than thosereported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memorandashould be open to the inspection of the Government. Only in this waycan violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system ofexamination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that nowconducted into the National banks by the bank examiners; a fewfirst class railroad accountants, if they had proper direction andproper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much inpreventing willful violations of the law. It would not be necessary forthem to examine into the accounts of any railroad unless for goodreasons they were directed to do so by the Interstate CommerceCommission. It is greatly to be desired that some way might be found bywhich an agreement as to transportation within a State intended tooperate as a fraud upon the Federal interstate commerce laws could bebrought under the jurisdiction of the Federal authorities. At presentit occurs that large shipments of interstate traffic are controlled byconcessions on purely State business, which of course amounts to anevasion of the law. The commission should have power to enforce fairtreatment by the great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines.I urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious actionby the Interstate Commerce Commission in all these matters, whether inregulating rates for transportation or for storing or for handlingproperty or commodities in transit. The history of the cases litigatedunder the present commerce act shows that its efficacy has been to agreat degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the mostformidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violatethe law.Let me most earnestly say that these recommendations are not made inany spirit of hostility to the railroads. On ethical grounds, ongrounds of right, such hostility would be intolerable; and on groundsof mere National self interest we must remember that such hostilitywould tell against the welfare not merely of some few rich men, but ofa multitude of small investors, a multitude of railway employes, wageworkers, and most severely against the interest of the public as awhole. I believe that on the whole our railroads have done well and notill; but the railroad men who wish to do well should not be exposed tocompetition with those who have no such desire, and the only way tosecure this end is to give to some Government tribunal the power to seethat justice is done by the unwilling exactly as it is gladly done bythe willing. Moreover, if some Government body is given increased powerthe effect will be to furnish authoritative answer on behalf of therailroad whenever irrational clamor against it is raised, or whenevercharges made against it are disproved. I ask this legislation not onlyin the interest of the public but in the interest of the honestrailroad man and the honest shipper alike, for it is they who arechiefly jeoparded by the practices of their dishonest competitors. Thislegislation should be enacted in a spirit as remote as possible fromhysteria and rancor. If we of the American body politic are true to thetraditions we have inherited we shall always scorn any effort to makeus hate any man because he is rich, just as much as we should scorn anyeffort to make us look down upon or treat contemptuously any manbecause he is poor. We judge a man by his conduct that is, by hischaracter and not by his wealth or intellect. If he makes his fortunehonestly, there is no just cause of quarrel with him. Indeed, we havenothing but the kindliest feelings of admiration for the successfulbusiness man who behaves decently, whether he has made his success bybuilding or managing a railroad or by shipping goods over thatrailroad. The big railroad men and big shippers are simply Americans ofthe ordinary type who have developed to an extraordinary degree certaingreat business qualities. They are neither better nor worse than theirfellow citizens of smaller means. They are merely more able in certainlines and therefore exposed to certain peculiarly strong temptations.These temptations have not sprung newly into being; the exceptionallysuccessful among mankind have always been exposed to them; but theyhave grown amazingly in power as a result of the extraordinarydevelopment of industrialism along new lines, and under these newconditions, which the law makers of old could not foresee and thereforecould not provide against, they have become so serious and menacing asto demand entirely new remedies. It is in the interest of the best typeof railroad man and the best type of shipper no less than of the publicthat there should be Governmental supervision and regulation of thesegreat business operations, for the same reason that it is in theinterest of the corporation which wishes to treat its employes arightthat there should be an effective Employers\' Liability act, or aneffective system of factory laws to prevent the abuse of women andchildren. All such legislation frees the corporation that wishes to dowell from being driven into doing ill, in order to compete with itsrival, which prefers to do ill. We desire to set up a moral standard.There can be no delusion more fatal to the Nation than the delusionthat the standard of profits, of business prosperity, is sufficient injudging any business or political question from rate legislation tomunicipal government. Business success, whether for the individual orfor the Nation, is a good thing only so far as it is accompanied by anddevelops a high standard of conduct honor, integrity, civic courage.The kind of business prosperity that blunts the standard of honor, thatputs an inordinate value on mere wealth, that makes a man ruthless andconscienceless in trade, and weak and cowardly in citizenship, is not agood thing at all, but a very bad thing for the Nation. This Governmentstands for manhood first and for business only as an adjunct ofmanhood.The question of transportation lies at the root of all industrialsuccess, and the revolution in transportation which has taken placeduring the last half century has been the most important factor in thegrowth of the new industrial conditions. Most emphatically we do notwish to see the man of great talents refused the reward for histalents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized but we do desire tosee the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strongman shall be given no advantage over the weak man. We wish to insure asfair treatment for the small town as for the big city; for the smallshipper as for the big shipper. In the old days the highway ofcommerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; itbelonged to the public and the traffic along it was free. At presentthe railway is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it iskept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a verydifficult and complex thing to manage, and it is far better that itshould be managed by private individuals than by the Government. But itcan only be so managed on condition that justice is done the public. Itis because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads is highlyundesirable and would probably in this country entail far reachingdisaster, but I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them inthe interest of the public as will make it evident that there is noneed for public ownership. The opponents of Government regulation dwellupon the difficulties to be encountered and the intricate and involvednature of the problem. Their contention is true. It is a complicatedand delicate problem, and all kinds of difficulties are sure to arisein connection with any plan of solution, while no plan will bring allthe benefits hoped for by its more optimistic adherents. Moreover,under any healthy plan, the benefits will develop gradually and notrapidly. Finally, we must clearly understand that the public servantswho are to do this peculiarly responsible and delicate work mustthemselves be of the highest type both as regards integrity andefficiency. They must be well paid, for otherwise able men cannot inthe long run be secured; and they must possess a lofty probity whichwill revolt as quickly at the thought of pandering to any gust ofpopular prejudice against rich men as at the thought of anything evenremotely resembling subserviency to rich men. But while I fully admitthe difficulties in the way, I do not for a moment admit that thesedifficulties warrant us in stopping in our effort to secure a wise andjust system. They should have no other effect than to spur us on to theexercise of the resolution, the even handed justice, and the fertilityof resource, which we like to think of as typically American, and whichwill in the end achieve good results in this as in other fields ofactivity. The task is a great one and underlies the task of dealingwith the whole industrial problem. But the fact that it is a greatproblem does not warrant us in shrinking from the attempt to solve it.At present we face such utter lack of supervision, such freedom fromthe restraints of law, that excellent men have often been literallyforced into doing what they deplored because otherwise they were leftat the mercy of unscrupulous competitors. To rail at and assail the menwho have done as they best could under such conditions accomplisheslittle. What we need to do is to develop an orderly system, and such asystem can only come through the gradually increased exercise of theright of efficient Government control.In my annual message to the Fifty eighth Congress, at its thirdsession, I called attention to the necessity for legislation requiringthe use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce.The number of serious collisions upon unblocked roads that haveoccurred within the past year adds force to the recommendation thenmade. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legislation, for theintroduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged in interstatecommerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of increasedsafety to the traveling public.Through decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and thelower Federal courts in cases brought before them for adjudication thesafety appliance law has been materially strengthened, and theGovernment has been enabled to secure its effective enforcement inalmost all cases, with the result that the condition of railroadequipment throughout the country is much improved and railroad employesperform their duties under safer conditions than heretofore. TheGovernment\'s most effective aid in arriving at this result has been itsinspection service, and that these improved conditions are not moregeneral is due to the insufficient number of inspectors employed. Theinspection service has fully demonstrated its usefulness, and inappropriating for its maintenance the Congress should make provisionfor an increase in the number of inspectors.The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employes in trainservice are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may wellengage the serious attention of the Congress. The strain, both mentaland physical, upon those who are engaged in the movement and operationof railroad trains under modern conditions is perhaps greater than thatwhich exists in any other industry, and if there are any reasons forlimiting by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainlyapply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whosevigilance and alertness in the performance of their duties the safetyof all who travel by rail depends.In my annual message to the Fifty seventh Congress, at its secondsession, I recommended the passage of an employers\' liability law forthe District of Columbia and in our navy yards. I renewed thatrecommendation in my message to the Fifty eighth Congress, at itssecond session, and further suggested the appointment of a commissionto make a comprehensive study of employers\' liability, with a view tothe enactment of a wise and Constitutional law covering the subject,applicable to all industries within the scope of the Federal power. Ihope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speedily aspossible.The National Government has, as a rule, but little occasion to dealwith the formidable group of problems connected more or less directlywith what is known as the labor question, for in the great majority ofcases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipalauthorities, and not by the National Government. The NationalGovernment has control of the District of Columbia, however, and itshould see to it that the City of Washington is made a model city inall respects, both as regards parks, public playgrounds, properregulation of the system of housing, so as to do away with the evils ofalley tenements, a proper system of education, a proper system ofdealing with truancy and juvenile offenders, a proper handling of thecharitable work of the District. Moreover, there should be properfactory laws to prevent all abuses in the employment of women andchildren in the District. These will be useful chiefly as objectlessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of realNational value.There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issueinjunctions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of the equitypowers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judgeshave misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of thepower any more than an improper exercise of the power to call a strikeby a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. Theremedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give duenotice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing tobe ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and placeordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case; itshould not be used as a pretext to permit violation of law or thejeopardizing of life or property. Of course, this would not authorizethe issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in whichit is not already authorized by existing law.I renew the recommendation I made in my last annual message for aninvestigation by the Department of Commerce and Labor of general laborconditions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of childlabor and child labor legislation in the several States. Such aninvestigation should take into account the various problems with whichthe question of child labor is connected. It is true that theseproblems can be actually met in most cases only by the Statesthemselves, but it would be well for the Nation to endeavor to secureand publish comprehensive information as to the conditions of the laborof children in the different States, so as to spur up those that arebehindhand and to secure approximately uniform legislation of a highcharacter among the several States. In such a Republic as ours the onething that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem of turning outdecent citizens. The future of the Nation depends upon the citizenshipof the generations to come; the children of today are those whotomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford toneglect them. The Legislature of Colorado has recommended that theNational Government provide some general measure for the protectionfrom abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. Ilay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorableconsideration.The Department of Commerce and Labor should also make a thoroughinvestigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over five millionAmerican women are now engaged in gainful occupations; yet there is analmost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthyconclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast andcomplicated. There is need of full knowledge on which to base actionlooking toward State and municipal legislation for the protection ofworking women. The introduction of women into industry is workingchange and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the Nation.The decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has beencoincident with it. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustmentof factory conditions must be made, but surely it can be made with lessfriction and less harmful effects on family life than is now the case.This whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociologicalphenomena of our time; it is a social question of the first importance,of far greater importance than any merely political or economicquestion can be, and to solve it we need ample data, gathered in a saneand scientific spirit in the course of an exhaustive investigation.In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employeinterested, but a third party the general public. Every considerablelabor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should beinvestigated by the Government and the facts officially reported to thepublic.The question of securing a healthy, self respecting, and mutuallysympathetic attitude as between employer and employe, capitalist andwage worker, is a difficult one. All phases of the labor problem provedifficult when approached. But the underlying principles, the rootprinciples, in accordance with which the problem must be solved areentirely simple. We can get justice and right dealing only if we put asof paramount importance the principle of treating a man on his worth asa man rather than with reference to his social position, his occupationor the class to which he belongs. There are selfish and brutal men inall ranks of life. If they are capitalists their selfishness andbrutality may take the form of hard indifference to suffering, greedydisregard of every moral restraint which interferes with theaccumulation of wealth, and cold blooded exploitation of the weak; or,if they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of the morefortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of murderous violence.Such conduct is just as reprehensible in one case as in the other, andall honest and farseeing men should join in warring against it whereverit becomes manifest. Individual capitalist and individual wage worker,corporation and union, are alike entitled to the protection of the law,and must alike obey the law. Moreover, in addition to mere obedience tothe law, each man, if he be really a good citizen, must show broadsympathy for his neighbor and genuine desire to look at any questionarising between them from the standpoint of that neighbor no less thanfrom his own, and to this end it is essential that capitalist andwage worker should consult freely one with the other, should eachstrive to bring closer the day when both shall realize that they areproperly partners and not enemies. To approach the questions whichinevitably arise between them solely from the standpoint which treatseach side in the mass as the enemy of the other side in the mass isboth wicked and foolish. In the past the most direful among theinfluences which have brought about the downfall of republics has everbeen the growth of the class spirit, the growth of the spirit whichtends to make a man subordinate the welfare of the public as a whole tothe welfare of the particular class to which he belongs, thesubstitution of loyalty to a class for loyalty to the Nation. Thisinevitably brings about a tendency to treat each man not on his meritsas an individual, but on his position as belonging to a certain classin the community. If such a spirit grows up in this Republic it willultimately prove fatal to us, as in the past it has proved fatal toevery community in which it has become dominant. Unless we continue tokeep a quick and lively sense of the great fundamental truth that ourconcern is with the individual worth of the individual man, thisGovernment cannot permanently hold the place which it has achievedamong the nations. The vital lines of cleavage among our people do notcorrespond, and indeed run at right angles to, the lines of cleavagewhich divide occupation from occupation, which divide wage workers fromcapitalists, farmers from bankers, men of small means from men of largemeans, men who live in the towns from men who live in the country; forthe vital line of cleavage is the line which divides the honest man whotries to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest man who does ill byhis neighbor. In other words, the standard we should establish is thestandard of conduct, not the standard of occupation, of means, or ofsocial position. It is the man\'s moral quality, his attitude toward thegreat questions which concern all humanity, his cleanliness of life,his power to do his duty toward himself and toward others, which reallycount; and if we substitute for the standard of personal judgment whichtreats each man according to his merits, another standard in accordancewith which all men of one class are favored and all men of anotherclass discriminated against, we shall do irreparable damage to the bodypolitic. I believe that our people are too sane, too self respecting,too fit for self government, ever to adopt such an attitude. ThisGovernment is not and never shall be government by a plutocracy. ThisGovernment is not and never shall be government by a mob. It shallcontinue to be in the future what it has been in the past, a Governmentbased on the theory that each man, rich or poor, is to be treatedsimply and solely on his worth as a man, that all his personal andproperty rights are to be safeguarded, and that he is neither to wrongothers nor to suffer wrong from others.The noblest of all forms of government is self government; but it isalso the most difficult. We who possess this priceless boon, and whodesire to hand it on to our children and our children\'s children,should ever bear in mind the thought so finely expressed by Burke: "Menare qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to theirdisposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportionas they are disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good inpreference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist unless acontrolling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and theless of it there be within the more there must be without. It isordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperateminds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters."The great insurance companies afford striking examples of corporationswhose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of theStates which created them as to preclude strict enforcement ofsupervision and regulation by the parent States. In my last annualmessage I recommended "that the Congress carefully consider whether thepower of the Bureau of Corporations cannot constitutionally be extendedto cover interstate transactions in insurance."Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustiveconsideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible tofurnish better safeguards than the several States have been able tofurnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed.It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the headof these large corporations take but small note of the ethicaldistinction between honesty and dishonesty; they draw the line onlythis side of what may be called law honesty, the kind of honestynecessary in order to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Ofcourse the only complete remedy for this condition must be found in anaroused public conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in thecommunity at large, and especially among business men and in the greatprofession of the law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns alldishonesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes theshape of bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislationwhich is not only drastic but practical. There is need of a farstricter and more uniform regulation of the vast insurance interests ofthis country. The United States should in this respect follow thepolicy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision ofcommercial interests which are clearly national in character. Mypredecessors have repeatedly recognized that the foreign business ofthese companies is an important part of our foreign commercialrelations. During the administrations of Presidents Cleveland,Harrison, and McKinley the State Department exercised its influence,through diplomatic channels, to prevent unjust discrimination byforeign countries against American insurance companies. Thesenegotiations illustrated the propriety of the Congress recognizing theNational character of insurance, for in the absence of Federallegislation the State Department could only give expression to thewishes of the authorities of the several States, whose policy wasineffective through want of uniformity.I repeat my previous recommendation that the Congress should alsoconsider whether the Federal Government has any power or owes any dutywith respect to domestic transactions in insurance of an interstatecharacter. That State supervision has proved inadequate is generallyconceded. The burden upon insurance companies, and therefore theirpolicy holders, of conflicting regulations of many States, isunquestioned, while but little effective check is imposed upon any ableand unscrupulous man who desires to exploit the company in his owninterest at the expense of the policy holders and of the public. Theinability of a State to regulate effectively insurance corporationscreated under the laws of other States and transacting the larger partof their business elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for this evil ofconflicting, ineffective, and yet burdensome regulations there has beenfor many years a widespread demand for Federal supervision. TheCongress has already recognized that interstate insurance may be aproper subject for Federal legislation, for in creating the Bureau ofCorporations it authorized it to publish and supply useful informationconcerning interstate corporations, "including corporations engaged ininsurance." It is obvious that if the compilation of statistics be thelimit of the Federal power it is wholly ineffective to regulate thisform of commercial intercourse between the States, and as the insurancebusiness has outgrown in magnitude the possibility of adequate Statesupervision, the Congress should carefully consider whether furtherlegislation can be bad. What is said above applies with equal force tofraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for lifeinsurance.There is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an idealperfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the shock and strainto the business world certain to attend any serious change in thesemethods render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It isnot possible to lay down any general rule by which to determine themoment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such achange. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires,of the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not necessarilyidentical. Of course, no change can be made on lines beneficial to, ordesired by, one section or one State only. There must be something likea general agreement among the citizens of the several States, asrepresented in the Congress, that the change is needed and desired inthe interest of the people, as a whole; and there should then be asincere, intelligent, and disinterested effort to make it in such shapeas will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the peopleat large with the minimum of necessary disregard for the specialinterests of localities or classes. But in time of peace the revenuemust on the average, taking a series of years together, equal theexpenditures or else the revenues must be increased. Last year therewas a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenuesthen our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is as yet too early toattempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for itis as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It shouldbe considered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws shouldprovide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximumand minimum tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure acertain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves.Having in view even larger considerations of policy than those of apurely economic nature, it would, in my judgment, be well to endeavorto bring about closer commercial connections with the other peoples ofthis continent. I am happy to be able to announce to you that Russianow treats us on the most favored nation basis.I earnestly recommend to Congress the need of economy and to this endof a rigid scrutiny of appropriations. As examples merely, I call yourattention to one or two specific matters. All unnecessary officesshould be abolished. The Commissioner of the General Land Officerecommends the abolishment of the office of Receiver of Public Moneysfor the United States Land Office. This will effect a saving of about aquarter of a million dollars a year. As the business of the Nationgrows, it is inevitable that there should be from time to time alegitimate increase in the number of officials, and this fact rendersit all the more important that when offices become unnecessary theyshould be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving ofpublic money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency topublish masses of unimportant information. It is probably not unfair tosay that many tens of thousands of volumes are published at which nohuman being ever looks and for which there is no real demand whatever.Yet, in speaking of economy, I must in no wise be understood asadvocating the false economy which is in the end the worstextravagance. To cut down on the navy, for instance, would be a crimeagainst the Nation. To fail to push forward all work on the PanamaCanal would be as great a folly.In my message of December 2, 1902, to the Congress I said:"Interest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in orderthat these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs of theseasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent therecurrence of financial stringencies, which injuriously affectlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element ofelasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants ofcommerce, and, upon them should be placed, as far as practicable, theburden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to supplythe needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic and foreigncommerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated that asufficient supply should be always available for the business interestsof the country."Every consideration of prudence demands the addition of the element ofelasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist in aninadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, whichdoes not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities andof seasons. Inflation must be avoided; but some provision should bemade that will insure a larger volume of money during the Fall andWinter months than in the less active seasons of the year; so that thecurrency will contract against speculation, and will expand for theneeds of legitimate business. At present the Treasury Department is atirregularly recurring intervals obliged, in the interest of thebusiness world that is, in the interests of the American public totry to avert financial crises by providing a remedy which should beprovided by Congressional action.At various times I have instituted investigations into the organizationand conduct of the business of the executive departments. While none ofthese inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant finalconclusions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the generalimpression that the organization of the departments is often faulty inprinciple and wasteful in results, while many of their business methodsare antiquated and inefficient. There is every reason why our executivegovernmental machinery should be at least as well planned, economical,and efficient as the best machinery of the great businessorganizations, which at present is not the case. To make it so is atask of complex detail and essentially executive in its nature;probably no legislative body, no matter how wise and able, couldundertake it with reasonable prospect of success. I recommend that theCongress consider this subject with a view to provide by legislationfor the transfer, distribution, consolidation, and assignment of dutiesand executive organizations or parts of organizations, and for thechanges in business methods, within or between the several departments,that will best promote the economy, efficiency, and high character ofthe Government work.In my last annual message I said:"The power of the Government to protect the integrity of the electionsof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmedby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy offree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruptionof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it wouldseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicateit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery andcorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may besafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go asfar as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should includesevere penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended toinfluence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions for thepublication not only of the expenditures for nominations and electionsof all candidates, but also of all contributions received andexpenditures made by political committees."I desire to repeat this recommendation. In political campaigns in acountry as large and populous as ours it is inevitable that thereshould be much expense of an entirely legitimate kind. This, of course,means that many contributions, and some of them of large size, must bemade, and, as a matter of fact, in any big political contest suchcontributions are always made to both sides. It is entirely proper bothto give and receive them, unless there is an improper motive connectedwith either gift or reception. If they are extorted by any kind ofpressure or promise, express or implied, direct or indirect, in the wayof favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes not onlyimproper but criminal. It will undoubtedly be difficult, as a matter ofpractical detail, to shape an act which shall guard with reasonablecertainty against such misconduct; but if it is possible to secure bylaw the full and verified publication in detail of all the sumscontributed to and expended by the candidates or committees of anypolitical parties, the result cannot but be wholesome. Allcontributions by corporations to any political committee or for anypolitical purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not bepermitted to use stockholders\' money for such purposes; and, moreover,a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effectivemethod of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Notonly should both the National and the several State Legislatures forbidany officer of a corporation from using the money of the corporation inor about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money inconnection with any legislation save by the employment of counsel inpublic manner for distinctly legal services.The first conference of nations held at The Hague in 1899, being unableto dispose of all the business before it, recommended the considerationand settlement of a number of important questions by another conferenceto be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions werethe following: (1) The rights and duties of neutrals; (2) thelimitation of the armed forces on land and sea, and of militarybudgets; (3) the use of new types and calibres of military and navalguns; (4) the inviolability of private property at sea in times of war;(5) the bombardment of ports, cities, and villages by naval forces. InOctober, 1904, at the instance of the Interparliamentary Union, which,at a conference held in the United States, and attended by thelawmakers of fifteen different nations, had reiterated the demand for asecond conference of nations, I issued invitations to all the powerssignatory to The Hague Convention to send delegates to such aconference, and suggested that it be again held at The Hague. In itsnote of December 16, 1904, the United States Government communicated tothe representatives of foreign governments its belief that theconference could be best arranged under the provisions of the presentHague treaty.From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled in some cases withthe condition that we should wait until the end of the war then wagingbetween Russia and Japan. The Emperor of Russia, immediately after thetreaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a notepresented to the President on September 13, through Ambassador Rosen,took the initiative in recommending that the conference be now called.The United States Government in response expressed its cordialacquiescence, and stated that it would, as a matter of course, takepart in the new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assumethat all civilized governments will support the movement, and that theconference is now an assured fact. This Government will do everythingin its power to secure the success of the conference, to the end thatsubstantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace,justice, and good will.This renders it proper at this time to say something as to the generalattitude of this Government toward peace. More and more war is comingto be looked upon as in itself a lamentable and evil thing. A wanton oruseless war, or a war of mere aggression in short, any war begun orcarried on in a conscienceless spirit, is to be condemned as apeculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity. We can, however, donothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever clearly inmind the ethical element which lies at the root of the problem. Our aimis righteousness. Peace is normally the hand maiden of rightousness;but when peace and righteousness conflict then a great and uprightpeople can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path which leadstoward righteousness, even though that path also leads to war. Thereare persons who advocate peace at any price; there are others who,following a false analogy, think that because it is no longer necessaryin civilized countries for individuals to protect their rights with astrong hand, it is therefore unnecessary for nations to be ready todefend their rights. These persons would do irreparable harm to anynation that adopted their principles, and even as it is they seriouslyhamper the cause which they advocate by tending to render it absurd inthe eyes of sensible and patriotic men. There can be no worse foe ofmankind in general, and of his own country in particular, than thedemagogue of war, the man who in mere folly or to serve his own selfishends continually rails at and abuses other nations, who seeks to excitehis countrymen against foreigners on insufficient pretexts, who excitesand inflames a perverse and aggressive national vanity, and who may onoccasions wantonly bring on conflict between his nation and some othernation. But there are demagogues of peace just as there are demagoguesof war, and in any such movement as this for The Hague conference it isessential not to be misled by one set of extremists any more than bythe other. Whenever it is possible for a nation or an individual towork for real peace, assuredly it is failure of duty not so to strive,but if war is necessary and righteous then either the man or the nationshrinking from it forfeits all title to self respect. We have scantsympathy with the sentimentalist who dreads oppression less thanphysical suffering, who would prefer a shameful peace to the pain andtoil sometimes lamentably necessary in order to secure a righteouspeace. As yet there is only a partial and imperfect analogy betweeninternational law and internal or municipal law, because there is nosanction of force for executing the former while there is in the caseof the latter. The private citizen is protected in his rights by thelaw, because the law rests in the last resort upon force exercisedthrough the forms of law. A man does not have to defend his rights withhis own hand, because he can call upon the police, upon the sheriff\'sposse, upon the militia, or in certain extreme cases upon the army, todefend him. But there is no such sanction of force for internationallaw. At present there could be no greater calamity than for the freepeoples, the enlightened, independent, and peace loving peoples, todisarm while yet leaving it open to any barbarism or despotism toremain armed. So long as the world is as unorganized as now the armiesand navies of those peoples who on the whole stand for justice, offernot only the best, but the only possible, security for a just peace.For instance, if the United States alone, or in company only with theother nations that on the whole tend to act justly, disarmed, we mightsometimes avoid bloodshed, but we would cease to be of weight insecuring the peace of justice the real peace for which the mostlaw abiding and high minded men must at times be willing to fight. Asthe world is now, only that nation is equipped for peace that knows howto fight, and that will not shrink from fighting if ever the conditionsbecome such that war is demanded in the name of the highest morality.So much it is emphatically necessary to say in order both that theposition of the United States may not be misunderstood, and that agenuine effort to bring nearer the day of the peace of justice amongthe nations may not be hampered by a folly which, in striving toachieve the impossible, would render it hopeless to attempt theachievement of the practical. But, while recognizing most clearly allabove set forth, it remains our clear duty to strive in everypracticable way to bring nearer the time when the sword shall not bethe arbiter among nations. At present the practical thing to do is totry to minimize the number of cases in which it must be the arbiter,and to offer, at least to all civilized powers, some substitute for warwhich will be available in at least a considerable number of instances.Very much can be done through another Hague conference in thisdirection, and I most earnestly urge that this Nation do all in itspower to try to further the movement and to make the result of thedecisions of The Hague conference effective. I earnestly hope that theconference may be able to devise some way to make arbitration betweennations the customary way of settling international disputes in allsave a few classes of cases, which should themselves be as sharplydefined and rigidly limited as the present governmental and socialdevelopment of the world will permit. If possible, there should be ageneral arbitration treaty negotiated among all the nations representedat the conference. Neutral rights and property should be protected atsea as they are protected on land. There should be an internationalagreement to this purpose and a similar agreement defining contrabandof war.During the last century there has been a distinct diminution in thenumber of wars between the most civilized nations. Internationalrelations have become closer and the development of The Hague tribunalis not only a symptom of this growing closeness of relationship, but isa means by which the growth can be furthered. Our aim should be fromtime to time to take such steps as may be possible toward creatingsomething like an organization of the civilized nations, because as theworld becomes more highly organized the need for navies and armies willdiminish. It is not possible to secure anything like an immediatedisarmament, because it would first be necessary to settle what peoplesare on the whole a menace to the rest of mankind, and to provideagainst the disarmament of the rest being turned into a movement whichwould really chiefly benefit these obnoxious peoples; but it may bepossible to exercise some check upon the tendency to swell indefinitelythe budgets for military expenditure. Of course such an effort couldsucceed only if it did not attempt to do too much; and if it wereundertaken in a spirit of sanity as far removed as possible from amerely hysterical pseudo philanthropy. It is worth while pointing outthat since the end of the insurrection in the Philippines this Nationhas shown its practical faith in the policy of disarmament by reducingits little army one third. But disarmament can never be of primeimportance; there is more need to get rid of the causes of war than ofthe implements of war.I have dwelt much on the dangers to be avoided by steering clear of anymere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace is so genuine andearnest; because I have a real and great desire that this second Hagueconference may mark a long stride forward in the direction of securingthe peace of justice throughout the world. No object is better worthythe attention of enlightened statesmanship than the establishment of asurer method than now exists of securing justice as between nations,both for the protection of the little nations and for the prevention ofwar between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only toavert bloodshed, but, above all, effectively to strengthen the forcesof right. The Golden Rule should be, and as the world grows in moralityit will be, the guiding rule of conduct among nations as amongindividuals; though the Golden Rule must not be construed, in fantasticmanner, as forbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty andfree Republic should ever deal with all other States, great or small,on a basis of high honor, respecting their rights as jealously as itsafeguards its own.One of the most effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrineas it has been and is being gradually developed by this Nation andaccepted by other nations. No other policy could have been as efficientin promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to eachnation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. If we hadrefused to apply the doctrine to changing conditions it would now becompletely outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day,and, indeed, would probably by this time have sunk into completeoblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroadbecause we have adapted our application of it to meet the growing andchanging needs of the hemisphere. When we announce a policy such as theMonroe Doctrine we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of thepolicy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out ofthe question to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for itsexercise. Not only we, but all American republics who are benefited bythe existence of the doctrine, must recognize the obligations eachnation is under as regards foreign peoples no less than its duty toinsist upon its own rights.That our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenanceof the doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This isespecially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As amere matter of self defense we must exercise a close watch over theapproaches to this canal; and this means that we must be thoroughlyalive to our interests in the Caribbean Sea.There are certain essential points which must never be forgotten asregards the Monroe Doctrine. In the first place we must as a Nationmake it evident that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or wayas an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the expense of therepublics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in some SouthAmerican countries there has been much suspicion lest we shouldinterpret the Monroe Doctrine as in some way inimical to theirinterests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of thiscontinent once and for all that no just and orderly Government hasanything to fear from us. There are certain republics to the south ofus which have already reached such a point of stability, order, andprosperity that they themselves, though as yet hardly consciously, areamong the guarantors of this doctrine. These republics we now meet notonly on a basis of entire equality, but in a spirit of frank andrespectful friendship, which we hope is mutual. If all of the republicsto the south of us will only grow as those to which I allude havealready grown, all need for us to be the especial champions of thedoctrine will disappear, for no stable and growing American Republicwishes to see some great non American military power acquire territoryin its neighborhood. All that this country desires is that the otherrepublics on this continent shall be happy and prosperous; and theycannot be happy and prosperous unless they maintain order within theirboundaries and behave with a just regard for their obligations towardoutsiders. It must be understood that under no circumstances will theUnited States use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorialaggression. We desire peace with all the world, but perhaps most of allwith the other peoples of the American Continent. There are, of course,limits to the wrongs which any self respecting nation can endure. It isalways possible that wrong actions toward this Nation, or towardcitizens of this Nation, in some State unable to keep order among itsown people, unable to secure justice from outsiders, and unwilling todo justice to those outsiders who treat it well, may result in ourhaving to take action to protect our rights; but such action will notbe taken with a view to territorial aggression, and it will be taken atall only with extreme reluctance and when it has become evident thatevery other resource has been exhausted.Moreover, we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit theMonroe Doctrine to be used by any nation on this Continent as a shieldto protect it from the consequences of its own misdeeds against foreignnations. If a republic to the south of us commits a tort against aforeign nation, such as an outrage against a citizen of that nation,then the Monroe Doctrine does not force us to interfere to preventpunishment of the tort, save to see that the punishment does not assumethe form of territorial occupation in any shape. The case is moredifficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. Our ownGovernment has always refused to enforce such contractual obligationson behalf, of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is much to bewished that all foreign governments would take the same view. But theydo not; and in consequence we are liable at any time to be brought faceto face with disagreeable alternatives. On the one hand, this countrywould certainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign governmentfrom collecting a just debt; on the other hand, it is very inadvisableto permit any foreign power to take possession, even temporarily, ofthe custom houses of an American Republic in order to enforce thepayment of its obligations; for such temporary occupation might turninto a permanent occupation. The only escape from these alternativesmay at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about somearrangement by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall bepaid. It is far better that this country should put through such anarrangement, rather than allow any foreign country to undertake it. Todo so insures the defaulting republic from having to pay debt of animproper character under duress, while it also insures honest creditorsof the republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest orgrasping creditors. Moreover, for the United States to take such aposition offers the only possible way of insuring us against a clashwith some foreign power. The position is, therefore, in the interest ofpeace as well as in the interest of justice. It is of benefit to ourpeople; it is of benefit to foreign peoples; and most of all it isreally of benefit to the people of the country concerned.This brings me to what should be one of the fundamental objects of theMonroe Doctrine. We must ourselves in good faith try to help upwardtoward peace and order those of our sister republics which need suchhelp. Just as there has been a gradual growth of the ethical element inthe relations of one individual to another, so we are, even thoughslowly, more and more coming to recognize the duty of bearing oneanother\'s burdens, not only as among individuals, but also as amongnations.Santo Domingo, in her turn, has now made an appeal to us to help her,and not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinctwithin us bids us respond to the appeal. It is not of the slightestconsequence whether we grant the aid needed by Santo Domingo as anincident to the wise development of the Monroe Doctrine or because weregard the case of Santo Domingo as standing wholly by itself, and tobe treated as such, and not on general principles or with any referenceto the Monroe Doctrine. The important point is to give the needed aid,and the case is certainly sufficiently peculiar to deserve to be judgedpurely on its own merits. The conditions in Santo Domingo have for anumber of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all societywas on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately, just at this time a rulersprang up in Santo Domingo, who, with his colleagues, saw the dangersthreatening their country and appealed to the friendship of the onlygreat and powerful neighbor who possessed the power, and as they hopedalso the will to help them. There was imminent danger of foreignintervention. The previous rulers of Santo Domingo had recklesslyincurred debts, and owing to her internal disorders she had ceased tobe able to provide means of paying the debts. The patience of herforeign creditors had become exhausted, and at least two foreignnations were on the point of intervention, and were only prevented fromintervening by the unofficial assurance of this Government that itwould itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. In thecase of one of these nations, only the actual opening of negotiationsto this end by our Government prevented the seizure of territory inSanto Domingo by a European power. Of the debts incurred some werejust, while some were not of a character which really renders itobligatory on or proper for Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But shecould not pay any of them unless some stability was assured herGovernment and people.Accordingly, the Executive Department of our Government negotiated atreaty under which we are to try to help the Dominican people tostraighten out their finances. This treaty is pending before theSenate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made whichwill last until the Senate has had time to take action upon the treaty.Under this arrangement the Dominican Government has appointed Americansto all the important positions in the customs service and they areseeing to the honest collection of the revenues, turning over 45 percent. to the Government for running expenses and putting the other 55per cent. into a safe depository for equitable division in case thetreaty shall be ratified, among the various creditors, whether Europeanor American.The Custom Houses offer well nigh the only sources of revenue in SantoDomingo, and the different revolutions usually have as their real aimthe obtaining of these Custom Houses. The mere fact that the Collectorsof Customs are Americans, that they are performing their duties withefficiency and honesty, and that the treaty is pending in the Senategives a certain moral power to the Government of Santo Domingo which ithas not had before. This has completely discouraged all revolutionarymovement, while it has already produced such an increase in therevenues that the Government is actually getting more from the 45 percent. that the American Collectors turn over to it than it got formerlywhen it took the entire revenue. It is enabling the poor, harassedpeople of Santo Domingo once more to turn their attention to industryand to be free from the cure of interminable revolutionary disturbance.It offers to all bona fide creditors, American and European, the onlyreally good chance to obtain that to which they are justly entitled,while it in return gives to Santo Domingo the only opportunity ofdefense against claims which it ought not to pay, for now if it meetsthe views of the Senate we shall ourselves thoroughly examine all theseclaims, whether American or foreign, and see that none that areimproper are paid. There is, of course, opposition to the treaty fromdishonest creditors, foreign and American, and from the professionalrevolutionists of the island itself. We have already reason to believethat some of the creditors who do not dare expose their claims tohonest scrutiny are endeavoring to stir up sedition in the island andopposition to the treaty. In the meantime, I have exercised theauthority vested in me by the joint resolution of the Congress toprevent the introduction of arms into the island for revolutionarypurposes.Under the course taken, stability and order and all the benefits ofpeace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, danger of foreignintervention has been suspended, and there is at last a prospect thatall creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the arrangementis terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow; and ifchaos follows, sooner or later this Government may be involved inserious difficulties with foreign Governments over the island, or elsemay be forced itself to intervene in the island in some unpleasantfashion. Under the proposed treaty the independence of the island isscrupulously respected, the danger of violation of the Monroe Doctrineby the intervention of foreign powers vanishes, and the interference ofour Government is minimized, so that we shall only act in conjunctionwith the Santo Domingo authorities to secure the proper administrationof the customs, and therefore to secure the payment of just debts andto secure the Dominican Government against demands for unjust debts.The proposed method will give the people of Santo Domingo the samechance to move onward and upward which we have already given to thepeople of Cuba. It will be doubly to our discredit as a Nation if wefail to take advantage of this chance; for it will be of damage toourselves, and it will be of incalculable damage to Santo Domingo.Every consideration of wise policy, and, above all, every considerationof large generosity, bids us meet the request of Santo Domingo as weare now trying to meet it.We cannot consider the question of our foreign policy without at thesame time treating of the Army and the Navy. We now have a very smallarmy indeed, one well nigh infinitesimal when compared With the army ofany other large nation. Of course the army we do have should be asnearly perfect of its kind and for its size as is possible. I do notbelieve that any army in the world has a better average of enlisted menor a better type of junior officer; but the army should be trained toact effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficientappropriations for manoeuvers of a practical kind, so that the troopsmay learn how to take care of themselves under actual serviceconditions; every march, for instance, being made with the soldierloaded exactly as he would be in active campaign. The Generals andColonels would thereby have opportunity of handling regiments,brigades, and divisions, and the commissary and medical departmentswould be tested in the field. Provision should be made for the exerciseat least of a brigade and by preference of a division in marching andembarking at some point on our coast and disembarking at some otherpoint and continuing its march. The number of posts in which the armyis kept in time of peace should be materially diminished and the poststhat are left made correspondingly larger. No local interests should beallowed to stand in the way of assembling the greater part of thetroops which would at need form our field armies in stations of suchsize as will permit the best training to be given to the personnel ofall grades, including the high officers and staff officers. Toaccomplish this end we must have not company or regimental garrisons,but brigade and division garrisons. Promotion by mere seniority cannever result in a thoroughly efficient corps of officers in the higherranks unless there accompanies it a vigorous weeding out process. Sucha weeding out process that is, such a process of selection is a chieffeature of the four years\' course of the young officer at West Point.There is no good reason why it should stop immediately upon hisgraduation. While at West Point he is dropped unless he comes up to acertain standard of excellence, and when he graduates he takes rank inthe army according to his rank of graduation. The results are good atWest Point; and there should be in the army itself something that willachieve the same end. After a certain age has been reached the averageofficer is unfit to do good work below a certain grade. Provisionshould be made for the promotion of exceptionally meritorious men overthe heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who havereached a given age without getting beyond a given rank; this age ofretirement of course changing from rank to rank. In both the army andthe navy there should be some principle of selection, that is, ofpromotion for merit, and there should be a resolute effort to eliminatethe aged officers of reputable character who possess no specialefficiency.There should be an increase in the coast artillery force, so that ourcoast fortifications can be in some degree adequately manned. There isspecial need for an increase and reorganization of the MedicalDepartment of the army. In both the army and navy there must be thesame thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fightingline. Only by such training in advance can we be sure that in actualwar field operations and those at sea will be carried on successfully.The importance of this was shown conclusively in the Spanish Americanand the Russo Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments in theJapanese army and navy is especially worthy of study. I renew myrecommendation of January 9, 1905, as to the Medical Department of thearmy and call attention to the equal importance of the needs of thestaff corps of the navy. In the Medical Department of the navy thefirst in importance is the reorganization of the Hospital Corps, on thelines of the Gallinger bill, (S. 3,984, February 1, 1904), and thereapportionment of the different grades of the medical officers to meetservice requirements. It seems advisable also that medical officers ofthe army and navy should have similar rank and pay in their respectivegrades, so that their duties can be carried on without friction whenthey are brought together. The base hospitals of the navy should be putin condition to meet modern requirements and hospital ships beprovided. Unless we now provide with ample forethought for the medicalneeds of the army and navy appalling suffering of a preventable kind issure to occur if ever the country goes to war. It is not reasonable toexpect successful administration in time of war of a department whichlacks a third of the number of officers necessary to perform themedical service in time of peace. We need men who are not merelydoctors; they must be trained in the administration of military medicalservice.Our navy must, relatively to the navies of other nations, always be ofgreater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a numberof years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly highstandard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only bemaintained, but increased. It does not seem to be necessary, however,that the navy should at least in the immediate future be increasedbeyond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary is tosubstitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become wornout or as it becomes apparent that they are useless. Probably theresult would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy eachyear, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up asthey are thus replaced. The four single turret monitors builtimmediately after the close of the Spanish war, for instance, arevessels which would be of but little use in the event of war. The moneyspent upon them could have been more usefully spent in other ways. Thusit would have been far better never to have built a single one of thesemonitors and to have put the money into an ample supply of reserveguns. Most of the smaller cruisers and gunboats, though they serve auseful purpose so far as they are needed for international police work,would not add to the strength of our navy in a conflict with a seriousfoe. There is urgent need of providing a large increase in the numberof officers, and especially in the number of enlisted men.Recent naval history has emphasized certain lessons which ought not to,but which do, need emphasis. Seagoing torpedo boats or destroyers areindispensable, not only for making night attacks by surprise upon anenemy, but even in battle for finishing already crippled ships. Underexceptional circumstances submarine boats would doubtless be of use.Fast scouts are needed. The main strength of the navy, however, lies,and can only lie, in the great battleships, the heavily armored,heavily gunned vessels which decide the mastery of the seas.Heavy armed cruisers also play a most useful part, and unarmedcruisers, if swift enough, are very useful as scouts. Betweenantagonists of approximately equal prowess the comparative perfectionof the instruments of war will ordinarily determine the fight. But itis, of course, true that the man behind the gun, the man in the engineroom, and the man in the conning tower, considered not onlyindividually, but especially with regard to the way in which they worktogether, are even more important than the weapons with which theywork. The most formidable battleship is, of course, helpless againsteven a light cruiser if the men aboard it are unable to hit anythingwith their guns, and thoroughly well handled cruisers may countseriously in an engagement with much superior vessels, if the menaboard the latter are ineffective, whether from lack of training orfrom any other cause. Modern warships are most formidable mechanismswhen well handled, but they are utterly useless when not well handled,and they cannot be handled at all without long and careful training.This training can under no circumstance be given when once war hasbroken out. No fighting ship of the first class should ever be laid upsave for necessary repairs, and her crew should be kept constantlyexercised on the high seas, so that she may stand at the highest pointof perfection. To put a new and untrained crew upon the most powerfulbattleship and send it out to meet a formidable enemy is not only toinvite, but to insure, disaster and disgrace. To improvise crews at theoutbreak of a war, so far as the serious fighting craft are concerned,is absolutely hopeless. If the officers and men are not thoroughlyskilled in, and have not been thoroughly trained to, their duties, itwould be far better to keep the ships in port during hostilities thanto send them against a formidable opponent, for the result could onlybe that they would be either sunk or captured. The marksmanship of ournavy is now on the whole in a gratifying condition, and there has beena great improvement in fleet practice. We need additional seamen; weneed a large store of reserve guns; we need sufficient money for ampletarget practice, ample practice of every kind at sea. We shouldsubstitute for comparatively inefficient types the old third classbattleship Texas, the single turreted monitors above mentioned, and,indeed, all the monitors and some of the old cruisers efficient,modern seagoing vessels. Seagoing torpedo boat destroyers should besubstituted for some of the smaller torpedo boats. During the presentCongress there need be no additions to the aggregate number of units ofthe navy. Our navy, though very small relatively to the navies of othernations, is for the present sufficient in point of numbers for ourneeds, and while we must constantly strive to make its efficiencyhigher, there need be no additions to the total of ships now built andbuilding, save in the way of substitution as above outlined. Irecommend the report of the Secretary of the Navy to the carefulconsideration of the Congress, especially with a view to thelegislation therein advocated.During the past year evidence has accumulated to confirm theexpressions contained in my last two annual messages as to theimportance of revising by appropriate legislation our system ofnaturalizing aliens. I appointed last March a commission to make acareful examination of our naturalization laws, and to suggestappropriate measures to avoid the notorious abuses resulting from theimprovident of unlawful granting of citizenship. This commission,composed of an officer of the Department of State, of the Department ofJustice, and of the Department of Commerce and Labor, has dischargedthe duty imposed upon it, and has submitted a report, which will betransmitted to the Congress for its consideration, and, I hope, for itsfavor, able action.The distinguishing recommendations of the commission are:First A Federal Bureau of Naturalization, to be established in theDepartment of Commerce and Labor, to supervise the administration ofthe naturalization laws and to receive returns of naturalizationspending and accomplished.Second Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged,and procedure.Third More exacting qualifications for citizenship.Fourth The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and noalien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing ofhis petition.Fifth Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to UnitedStates district courts and to such State courts as have jurisdiction incivil actions in which the amount in controversy is unlimited; incities of over 100,000 inhabitants the United States district courts tohave exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alienresidents of such cities.In my last message I asked the attention of the Congress to the urgentneed of action to make our criminal law more effective; and I mostearnestly request that you pay heed to the report of the AttorneyGeneral on this subject. Centuries ago it was especially needful tothrow every safeguard round the accused. The danger then was lest heshould be wronged by the State. The danger is now exactly the reverse.Our laws and customs tell immensely in favor of the criminal andagainst the interests of the public he has wronged. Some antiquated andoutworn rules which once safeguarded the threatened rights of privatecitizens, now merely work harm to the general body politic. Thecriminal law of the United States stands in urgent need of revision.The criminal process of any court of the United States should runthroughout the entire territorial extent of our country. The delays ofthe criminal law, no less than of the civil, now amount to a very greatevil.There seems to be no statute of the United States which provides forthe punishment of a United States Attorney or other officer of theGovernment who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrainfrom doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement isother than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied byappropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to coverexplicitly, unequivocally, and beyond question breach of trust in theshape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer oremploye of the United States, and to provide a suitable penaltytherefor. Such officer or employe owes the duty to the United States toguard carefully and not to divulge or in any manner use, prematurely,information which is accessible to the officer or employe by reason ofhis official position. Most breaches of public trust are alreadycovered by the law, and this one should be. It is impossible, no matterhow much care is used, to prevent the occasional appointment to thepublic service of a man who when tempted proves unfaithful; but everymeans should be provided to detect and every effort made to punish thewrongdoer. So far as in my power see each and every such wrongdoershall be relentlessly hunted down; in no instance in the past has hebeen spared; in no instance in the future shall he be spared. His crimeis a crime against every honest man in the Nation, for it is a crimeagainst the whole body politic. Yet in dwelling on such misdeeds it isunjust not to add that they are altogether exceptional, and that on thewhole the employes of the Government render upright and faithfulservice to the people. There are exceptions, notably in one or twobranches of the service, but at no time in the Nation\'s history has thepublic service of the Nation taken as a whole stood on a higher planethan now, alike as regards honesty and as regards efficiency.Once again I call your attention to the condition of the public landlaws. Recent developments have given new urgency to the need for suchchanges as will fit these laws to actual present conditions. The honestdisposal and right use of the remaining public lands is of fundamentalimportance. The iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of thepublic lands is being brought about under the present laws are becomingmore generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effectiveremedies. The recommendations of the Public Lands Commission upon thissubject are wise and should be given effect.The creation of small irrigated farms under the Reclamation act is apowerful offset to the tendency of certain other laws to foster orpermit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of greatirrigation works has been proceeding rapidly and successfully, thelands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the prospect that the policyof National irrigation will accomplish all that was expected of it isbright. The act should be extended to include the State of Texas.The Reclamation act derives much of its value from the fact that ittends to secure the greatest possible number of homes on the land, andto create communities of freeholders, in part by settlement on publiclands, in part by forcing the subdivision of large private holdingsbefore they can get water from Government irrigation works. The lawrequires that no right to the use of water for land in privateownership shall be sold for a tract exceeding 160 acres to any one landowner. This provision has excited active and powerful hostility, butthe success of the law itself depends on the wise and firm enforcementof it. We cannot afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on thepublic domain.The greater part of the remaining public lands can not be irrigated.They are at present and will probably always be of greater value forgrazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazinghomestead of 640 acres in Nebraska and to the proposed extension of itto other States. It is argued that a family can not be supported on 160acres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true, but neither can afamily be supported on 640 acres of much of the land to which it isproposed to apply the grazing homestead. To establish universally anysuch arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time. It wouldprobably result on the one hand in enlarging the holdings of some ofthe great land owners, and on the other in needless suffering andfailure on the part of a very considerable proportion of the bona fidesettlers who give faith to the implied assurance of the Government thatsuch an area is sufficient. The best use of the public grazing landsrequires the careful examination and classification of these lands inorder to give each settler land enough to support his family and nomore. While this work is being done, and until the lands are settled,the Government should take control of the open range, under reasonableregulations suited to local needs, following the general policy alreadyin successful operation on the forest reserves. It is probable that thepresent grazing value of the open public range is scarcely more thanhalf what it once was or what it might easily be again under carefulregulation.The forest policy of the Administration appears to enjoy the unbrokensupport of the people. The great users of timber are themselvesforwarding the movement for forest preservation. All organizedopposition to the forest preserves in the West has disappeared. Sincethe consolidation of all Government forest work in the National ForestService there has been a rapid and notable gain in the usefulness ofthe forest reserves to the people and in public appreciation of theirvalue. The National parks within or adjacent to forest reserves shouldbe transferred to the charge of the Forest Service also.The National Government already does something in connection with theconstruction and maintenance of the great system of levees along thelower course of the Mississippi; in my judgment it should do much more.To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in wara great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should haveships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutralmarkets, and in case of need to reinforce our battle line. It cannotbut be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines ofcommunication with our sister republics of South America should bechiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that Americanmerchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and lettersto South America via Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even onthe Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on theAtlantic, our merchant flag is now threatened through the liberal aidbestowed by other Governments on their own steam lines. I ask yourearnest consideration of the report with which the Merchant MarineCommission has followed its long and careful inquiry.I again heartily commend to your favorable consideration thetercentennial celebration at Jamestown, Va. Appreciating thedesirability of this commemoration, the Congress passed an act, March3, 1905, authorizing in the year 1907, on and near the waters ofHampton Roads, in the State of Virginia, an international naval,marine, and military celebration in honor of this event. By theauthority vested in me by this act, I have made proclamation of saidcelebration, and have issued, in conformity with its instructions,invitations to all the nations of the earth to participate, by sendingtheir naval vessels and such military organizations as may bepracticable. This celebration would fail of its full purpose unless itwere enduring in its results and commensurate with the importance ofthe event to be celebrated, the event from which our Nation dates itsbirth. I earnestly hope that this celebration, already indorsed by theCongress of the United States, and by the Legislatures of sixteenStates since the action of the Congress, will receive such additionalaid at your hands as will make it worthy of the great event it isintended to celebrate, and thereby enable the Government of the UnitedStates to make provision for the exhibition of its own resources, andlikewise enable our people who have undertaken the work of such acelebration to provide suitable and proper entertainment andinstruction in the historic events of our country for all who may visitthe exposition and to whom we have tendered our hospitality.It is a matter of unmixed satisfaction once more to call attention tothe excellent work of the Pension Bureau; for the veterans of the civilwar have a greater claim upon us than any other class of our citizens.To them, first of all among our people, honor is due.Seven years ago my lamented predecessor, President McKinley, statedthat the time had come for the Nation to care for the graves of theConfederate dead. I recommend that the Congress take action toward thisend. The first need is to take charge of the graves of the Confederatedead who died in Northern prisons.The question of immigration is of vital interest to this country. Inthe year ending June 30, 1905, there came to the United States1,026,000 alien immigrants. In other words, in the single year that hasjust elapsed there came to this country a greater number of people thancame here during the one hundred and sixty nine years of our Coloniallife which intervened between the first landing at Jamestown and theDeclaration of Independence. It is clearly shown in the report of theCommissioner General of Immigration that while much of this enormousimmigration is undoubtedly healthy and natural, a considerableproportion is undesirable from one reason or another; moreover, aconsiderable proportion of it, probably a very large proportion,including most of the undesirable class, does not come here of its owninitiative, but because of the activity of the agents of the greattransportation companies. These agents are distributed throughoutEurope, and by the offer of all kinds of inducements they wheedle andcajole many immigrants, often against their best interest, to comehere. The most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort tosecure a proper regulation of the immigration to these shores arisesfrom the determined opposition of the foreign steamship lines who haveno interest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns ontheir capital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steeragequarters of their ships.As I said in my last message to the Congress, we cannot have too muchimmigration of the right sort and we should have none whatever of thewrong sort. Of course, it is desirable that even the right kind ofimmigration should be properly distributed in this country. We needmore of such immigration for the South; and special effort should bemade to secure it. Perhaps it would be possible to limit the number ofimmigrants allowed to come in any one year to New York and otherNorthern cities, while leaving unlimited the number allowed to come tothe South; always provided, however, that a stricter effort is made tosee that only immigrants of the right kind come to our countryanywhere. In actual practice it has proved so difficult to enforce themigration laws where long stretches of frontier marked by an imaginaryline alone intervene between us and our neighbors that I recommend thatno immigrants be allowed to come in from Canada and Mexico save nativesof the two countries themselves. As much as possible should be done todistribute the immigrants upon the land and keep them away from thecontested tenement house districts of the great cities. Butdistribution is a palliative, not a cure. The prime need is to keep outall immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws nowexisting for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants should bestrengthened. Adequate means should be adopted, enforced by sufficientpenalties, to compel steamship companies engaged in the passengerbusiness to observe in good faith the law which forbids them toencourage or solicit immigration to the United States. Moreover, thereshould be a sharp limitation imposed upon all vessels coming to ourports as to the number of immigrants in ratio to the tonnage which eachvessel can carry. This ratio should be high enough to insure the cominghither of as good a class of aliens as possible. Provision should bemade for the surer punishment of those who induce aliens to come tothis country under promise or assurance of employment. It should bemade possible to inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any employerviolating this law to deter him from taking the risk. It seems to mewise that there should be an international conference held to deal withthis question of immigration, which has more than a merely Nationalsignificance; such a conference could, among other things, enter atlength into the method for securing a thorough inspection of would beimmigrants at the ports from which they desire to embark beforepermitting them to embark.In dealing with this question it is unwise to depart from the oldAmerican tradition and to discriminate for or against any man whodesires to come here and become a citizen, save on the ground of thatman\'s fitness for citizenship. It is our right and duty to consider hismoral and social quality. His standard of living should be such that hewill not, by pressure of competition, lower the standard of living ofour own wage workers; for it must ever be a prime object of ourlegislation to keep high their standard of living. If the man who seeksto come here is from the moral and social standpoint of such acharacter as to bid fair to add value to the community he should beheartily welcomed. We cannot afford to pay heed to whether he is of onecreed or another, of one nation, or another. We cannot afford toconsider whether he is Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whetherhe is Englishman or Irishman, Frenchman or German, Japanese, Italian,Scandinavian, Slav, or Magyar. What we should desire to find out is theindividual quality of the individual man. In my judgment, with this endin view, we shall have to prepare through our own agents a far morerigid inspection in the countries from which the immigrants come. Itwill be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants, but all of theright kind, than a great number of immigrants, many of whom arenecessarily of the wrong kind. As far as possible we wish to limit theimmigration to this country to persons who propose to become citizensof this country, and we can well afford to insist upon adequatescrutiny of the character of those who are thus proposed for futurecitizenship. There should be an increase in the stringency of the lawsto keep out insane, idiotic, epileptic, and pauper immigrants. But thisis by no means enough. Not merely the Anarchist, but every man ofAnarchistic tendencies, all violent and disorderly people, all peopleof bad character, the incompetent, the lazy, the vicious, thephysically unfit, defective, or degenerate should be kept out. Thestocks out of which American citizenship is to be built should bestrong and healthy, sound in body, mind, and character. If it beobjected that the Government agents would not always select well, theanswer is that they would certainly select better than do the agentsand brokers of foreign steamship companies, the people who now dowhatever selection is done.The questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand bythemselves. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinesecoolie class, that is, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled andunskilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrantsto this country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which theywork, and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the interestof this country to keep them out, but the Chinese authorities do notdesire that they should be admitted. At present their entrance isprohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. Theselaws have been, are being, and will be, thoroughly enforced. Theviolations of them are so few in number as to be infinitesimal and canbe entirely disregarded. This is no serious proposal to alter theimmigration law as regards the Chinese laborer, skilled or unskilled,and there is no excuse for any man feeling or affecting to feel theslightest alarm on the subject.But in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chineselaborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done bythis Nation to the people of China, and therefore ultimately to thisNation itself. Chinese students, business and professional men of allkinds not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers,professors, travelers, and the like should be encouraged to come here,and treated on precisely the same footing that we treat students,business men, travelers, and the like of other nations. Our laws andtreaties should be framed, not so as to put these people in theexcepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, exceptChinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled laborers.There would not be the least danger that any such provision wouldresult in any relaxation of the law about laborers. These will, underall conditions, be kept out absolutely. But it will be more easy to seethat both justice and courtesy are shown, as they ought to be shown, toother Chinese, if the law or treaty is framed as above suggested.Examinations should be completed at the port of departure from China.For this purpose there should be provided a more adequate ConsularService in China than we now have. The appropriations both for theoffices of the Consuls and for the office forces in the consulatesshould be increased.As a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and weexpect, and quite rightly intend to insist upon, justice being shown usby the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we doequity. We cannot ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling todo to them. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring menif our laboring men threatened to come into their country in suchnumbers as to jeopardize the well being of the Chinese population; andas, mutatis mutandis, these were the conditions with which Chineseimmigration actually brought this people face to face, we had and havea perfect right, which the Chinese Government in no way contests, toact as we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration.That this right exists for each country was explicitly acknowledged inthe last treaty between the two countries. But we must treat theChinese student, traveler, and business man in a spirit of the broadestjustice and courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accorded toour own people of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has comeduring the past Summer from the organized boycott against Americangoods which has been started in China. The main factor in producingthis boycott has been the resentment felt by the students and businesspeople of China, by all the Chinese leaders, against the harshness ofour law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and businessclasses.  This Government has the friendliest feeling for China anddesires China\'s well being. We cordially sympathize with the announcedpurpose of Japan to stand for the integrity of China. Such an attitudetends to the peace of the world.The civil service law has been on the statute books for twenty twoyears. Every President and a vast majority of heads of departments whohave been in office during that period have favored a gradual extensionof the merit system. The more thoroughly its principles have beenunderstood, the greater has been the favor with which the law has beenregarded by administration officers. Any attempt to carry on the greatexecutive departments of the Government without this law wouldinevitably result in chaos. The Civil Service Commissioners are doingexcellent work, and their compensation is inadequate considering theservice they perform.The statement that the examinations are not practical in character isbased on a misapprehension of the practice of the Commission. Thedepartments are invariably consulted as to the requirements desired andas to the character of questions that shall be asked. Generalinvitations are frequently sent out to all heads of departments askingwhether any changes in the scope or character of examinations arerequired. In other words, the departments prescribe the requirementsand qualifications desired, and the Civil Service Commissionco operates with them in securing persons with these qualifications andinsuring open and impartial competition. In a large number ofexaminations (as, for example, those for trades positions), there areno educational requirements whatever, and a person who can neither readnor write may pass with a high average. Vacancies in the service arefilled with reasonable expedition, and the machinery of the Commission,which reaches every part of the country, is the best agency that hasyet been devised for finding people with the most suitablequalifications for the various offices to be filled. Writtencompetitive examinations do not make an ideal method for fillingpositions, but they do represent an immeasurable advance upon the"spoils" method, under which outside politicians really make theappointments nominally made by the executive officers, the appointeesbeing chosen by the politicians in question, in the great majority ofcases, for reasons totally unconnected with the needs of the service orof the public.Statistics gathered by the Census Bureau show that the tenure of officein the Government service does not differ materially from that enjoyedby employes of large business corporations. Heads of executivedepartments and members of the Commission have called my attention tothe fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days\'notice before an employe could be separated from the service forinefficiency has served no good purpose whatever, because that is not amatter upon which a hearing of the employe found to be inefficient canbe of any value, and in practice the rule providing for such notice andhearing has merely resulted in keeping in a certain number ofincompetents, because of the reluctance of the heads of departments andbureau chiefs to go through the required procedure. Experience hasshown that this rule is wholly ineffective to save any man, if asuperior for improper reasons wishes to remove him, and is mischievousbecause it sometimes serves to keep in the service incompetent men notguilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts in view the rule hasbeen amended by providing that where the inefficiency or incapacitycomes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department theremoval may be made without notice, the reasons therefor being filedand made a record of the department. The absolute right of the removalrests where it always has rested, with the head of a department; anylimitation of this absolute right results in grave injury to the publicservice. The change is merely one of procedure; it was much needed, andit is producing good results.The civil service law is being energetically and impartially enforced,and in the large majority of cases complaints of violations of eitherthe law or rules are discovered to be unfounded. In this respect thislaw compares very favorably with any other Federal statute. Thequestion of politics in the appointment and retention of the menengaged in merely ministerial work has been practically eliminated inalmost the entire field of Government employment covered by the civilservice law. The action of the Congress in providing the commissionwith its own force instead of requiring it to rely on detailed clerkshas been justified by the increased work done at a smaller cost to theGovernment. I urge upon the Congress a careful consideration of therecommendations contained in the annual report of the commission.Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect indefinition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omitprovision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processesare entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyrightproprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of thepublic; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossiblefor the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.Attempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent, no less thantwelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the RevisedStatutes. To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable. Acomplete revision of them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modernconditions, has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden, andother foreign countries, and bills embodying it are pending in Englandand the Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals fora commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been pressed uponthe Congress. The inconveniences of the present conditions being sogreat, an attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by theCopyright Office, which has called conferences of the various interestsespecially and practically concerned with the operation of thecopyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to the changesnecessary; it has added from its own experience and investigations, andit has drafted a bill which embodies such of these changes andadditions as, after full discussion and expert criticism, appeared tobe sound and safe. In form this bill would replace the existinginsufficient and inconsistent laws by one general copyright statute. Itwill be presented to the Congress at the coming session. It deservesprompt consideration.I recommend that a law be enacted to regulate inter State commerce inmisbranded and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. Such law wouldprotect legitimate manufacture and commerce, and would tend to securethe health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic in food stuffswhich have been debased or adulterated so as to injure health or todeceive purchasers should be forbidden.The law forbidding the emission of dense black or gray smoke in thecity of Washington has been sustained by the courts. Something has beenaccomplished under it, but much remains to be done if we would preservethe capital city from defacement by the smoke nuisance. Repeatedprosecutions under the law have not had the desired effect. I recommendthat it be made more stringent by increasing both the minimum andmaximum fine; by providing for imprisonment in cases of repeatedviolation, and by affording the remedy of injunction against thecontinuation of the operation of plants which are persistent offenders.I recommend, also, an increase in the number of inspectors, whose dutyit shall be to detect violations of the act.I call your attention to the generous act of the State of California inconferring upon the United States Government the ownership of theYosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. There should be nodelay in accepting the gift, and appropriations should be made for theincluding thereof in the Yosemite National Park, and for the care andpolicing of the park. California has acted most wisely, as well as withgreat magnanimity, in the matter. There are certain mighty naturalfeatures of our land which should be preserved in perpetuity for ourchildren and our children\'s children. In my judgment, the Grand Canyonof the Colorado should be made into a National park. It is greatly tobe wished that the State of New York should copy as regards Niagarawhat the State of California has done as regards the Yosemite. Nothingshould be allowed to interfere with the preservation of Niagara Fallsin all their beauty and majesty. If the State cannot see to this, thenit is earnestly to be wished that she should be willing to turn it overto the National Government, which should in such case (if possible, inconjunction with the Canadian Government) assume the burden andresponsibility of preserving unharmed Niagara Falls; just as it shouldgladly assume a similar burden and responsibility for the YosemiteNational Park, and as it has already assumed them for the YellowstoneNational Park. Adequate provision should be made by the Congress forthe proper care and supervision of all these National parks. Theboundaries of the Yellowstone National Park should be extended to thesouth and east, to take in such portions of the abutting forestreservations as will enable the Government to protect the elk on theirWinter range.The most characteristic animal of the Western plains was the great,shaggy maned wild ox, the bison, commonly known as buffalo. Smallfragments of herds exist in a domesticated state here and there, a fewof them in the Yellowstone Park. Such a herd as that on the Flat headReservation should not be allowed to go out of existence. Either onsome reservation or on some forest reserve like the Wichita reserve andgame refuge provision should be made for the preservation of such aherd. I believe that the scheme would be of economic advantage, for therobe of the buffalo is of high market value, and the same is true ofthe robe of the crossbred animals.I call your especial attention to the desirability of giving to themembers of the Life Saving Service pensions such as are given tofiremen and policemen in all our great cities. The men in the LifeSaving Service continually and in the most matter of fact way do deedssuch as make Americans proud of their country. They have no politicalinfluence, and they live in such remote places that the really heroicservices they continually render receive the scantiest recognition fromthe public. It is unjust for a great nation like this to permit thesemen to become totally disabled or to meet death in the performance oftheir hazardous duty and yet to give them no sort of reward. If one ofthem serves thirty years of his life in such a position he shouldsurely be entitled to retire on half pay, as a fireman or policemandoes, and if he becomes totally incapacitated through accident orsickness, or loses his health in the discharge of his duty, he or hisfamily should receive a pension just as any soldier should. I call yourattention with especial earnestness to this matter because it appealsnot only to our judgment but to our sympathy; for the people on whosebehalf I ask it are comparatively few in number, render incalculableservice of a particularly dangerous kind, and have no one to speak forthem.During the year just past, the phase of the Indian question which hasbeen most sharply brought to public attention is the larger legalsignificance of the Indian\'s induction into citizenship. This has madeitself manifest not only in a great access of litigation in which thecitizen Indian figures as a party defendant and in a more widespreaddisposition to levy local taxation upon his personalty, but in adecision of the United States Supreme Court which struck away the mainprop on which has hitherto rested the Government\'s benevolent effort toprotect him against the evils of intemperance. The court holds, ineffect, that when an Indian becomes, by virtue of an allotment of landto him, a citizen of the State in which his land is situated, he passesfrom under Federal control in such matters as this, and the acts of theCongress prohibiting the sale or gift to him of intoxicants becomesubstantially inoperative. It is gratifying to note that the States andmunicipalities of the West which have most at stake in the welfare ofthe Indians are taking up this subject and are trying to supply, in ameasure at least, the abdication of its trusteeship forced upon theFederal Government. Nevertheless, I would urgently press upon theattention of the Congress the question whether some amendment of theinternal revenue laws might not be of aid in prosecuting thosemalefactors, known in the Indian country as "bootleggers," who areengaged at once in defrauding the United States Treasury of taxes and,what is far more important, in debauching the Indians by carryingliquors illicitly into territory still completely under Federaljurisdiction.Among the crying present needs of the Indians are more day schoolssituated in the midst of their settlements, more effective instructionin the industries pursued on their own farms, and a more liberaltension of the field matron service, which means the education of theIndian women in the arts of home making. Until the mothers are wellstarted in the right direction we cannot reasonably expect much fromthe children who are soon to form an integral part of our Americancitizenship. Moreover the excuse continually advanced by male adultIndians for refusing offers of remunerative employment at a distancefrom their homes is that they dare not leave their families too longout of their sight. One effectual remedy for this state of things is toemploy the minds and strengthen the moral fibre of the Indianwomen the end to which the work of the field matron is especiallydirected. I trust that the Congress will make its appropriations forIndian day schools and field matrons as generous as may consist withthe other pressing demands upon its providence.During the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recoveringfrom the series of disasters which, since American occupation, havegreatly reduced the amount of agricultural products below what wasproduced in Spanish times. The war, the rinderpest, the locusts, thedrought, and the cholera have been united as causes to prevent a returnof the prosperity much needed in the islands. The most serious is thedestruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draughtcattle, because it will take several years of breeding to restore thenecessary number of these indispensable aids to agriculture. Thecommission attempted to supply by purchase from adjoining countries theneeded cattle, but the experiments made were unsuccessful. Most of thecattle imported were unable to withstand the change of climate and therigors of the voyage and died from other diseases than rinderpest.The income of the Philippine Government has necessarily been reduced byreason of the business and agricultural depression in the islands, andthe Government has been obliged to exercise great economy to cut downits expenses, to reduce salaries, and in every way to avoid a deficit.It has adopted an internal revenue law, imposing taxes on cigars,cigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old Spanishindustrial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was hoped,and although its principle is undoubtedly correct, it may needamendments for the purpose of reconciling the people to its provisions.The income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction incustoms revenue.There has been a marked increase in the number of Filipinos employed inthe civil service, and a corresponding decrease in the number ofAmericans. The Government in every one of its departments has beenrendered more efficient by elimination of undesirable material and thepromotion of deserving public servants.Improvements of harbors, roads, and bridges continue, although thecutting down of the revenue forbids the expenditure of any great amountfrom current income for these purposes. Steps are being taken, byadvertisement for competitive bids, to secure the construction andmaintenance of 1,000 miles of railway by private corporations under therecent enabling legislation of the Congress. The transfer of the friarlands, in accordance with the contract made some two years ago, hasbeen completely effected, and the purchase money paid. Provision hasjust been made by statute for the speedy settlement in a specialproceeding in the Supreme Court of controversies over the possessionand title of church buildings and rectories arising between the RomanCatholic Church and schismatics claiming under ancient municipalities.Negotiations and hearings for the settlement of the amount due to theRoman Catholic Church for rent and occupation of churches and rectoriesby the army of the United States are in progress, and it is hoped asatisfactory conclusion may be submitted to the Congress before the endof the session.Tranquillity has existed during the past year throughout theArchipelago, except in the Province of Cavite, the Province of Batangasand the Province of Samar, and in the Island of Jolo among the Moros.The Jolo disturbance was put an end to by several sharp and shortengagements, and now peace prevails in the Moro Province, Cavite, themother of ladrones in the Spanish times, is so permeated with thetraditional sympathy of the people for ladronism as to make itdifficult to stamp out the disease. Batangas was only disturbed byreason of the fugitive ladrones from Cavite, Samar was thrown intodisturbance by the uneducated and partly savage peoples living in themountains, who, having been given by the municipal code more power thanthey were able to exercise discreetly, elected municipal officers whoabused their trusts, compelled the people raising hemp to sell it at amuch less price than it was worth, and by their abuses drove theirpeople into resistance to constituted authority. Cavite and Samar areinstances of reposing too much confidence in the self governing powerof a people. The disturbances have all now been suppressed, and it ishoped that with these lessons local governments can be formed whichwill secure quiet and peace to the deserving inhabitants. The incidentis another proof of the fact that if there has been any error asregards giving self government in the Philippines it has been in thedirection of giving it too quickly, not too slowly. A year from nextApril the first legislative assembly for the islands will be held. Onthe sanity and self restraint of this body much will depend so far asthe future self government of the islands is concerned.The most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the verygreat interest taken by the common people in education and the greatincrease in the number of enrolled students in the public schools. Theincrease was from 300,000 to half a million pupils. The averageattendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number ofpupils seems to be the capacity of the government to furnish teachersand school houses.The agricultural conditions of the islands enforce more strongly thanever the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products ofthe Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestlyrecommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon theproducts of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except thetariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 percent of the present rates under the Dingley act; that after July 1,1909, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the PhilippineIslands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the islandsand the United States in the products of each country then be providedfor by law.A statute in force, enacted April 15, 1904, suspends the operation ofthe coastwise laws of the United States upon the trade between thePhilippine Islands and the United States until July 1, 1906. Iearnestly recommend that this suspension be postponed until July 1,1909. I think it of doubtful utility to apply the coastwise laws to thetrade between the United States and the Philippines under anycircumstances, because I am convinced that it will do no good whateverto American bottoms, and will only interfere and be an obstacle to thetrade between the Philippines and the United States, but if thecoastwise law must be thus applied, certainly it ought not to haveeffect until free trade is enjoyed between the people of the UnitedStates and the people of the Philippine Islands in their respectiveproducts.I do not anticipate that free trade between the islands and the UnitedStates will produce a revolution in the sugar and tobacco production ofthe Philippine Islands. So primitive are the methods of agriculture inthe Philippine Islands, so slow is capital in going to the islands, somany difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in theislands, that it will be many, many years before the products of thoseislands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the UnitedStates. The problem of labor is also a formidable one with the sugarand tobacco producers in the islands. The best friends of the Filipinopeople and the people themselves are utterly opposed to the admissionof Chinese coolie labor. Hence the only solution is the training ofFilipino labor, and this will take a long time. The enactment of a lawby the Congress of the United States making provision for free tradebetween the islands and the United States, however, will be of greatimportance from a political and sentimental standpoint; and, while itsactual benefit has doubtless been exaggerated by the people of theislands, they will accept this measure of justice as an indication thatthe people of the United States are anxious to aid the people of thePhilippine Islands in every way, and especially in the agriculturaldevelopment of their archipelago. It will aid the Filipinos withoutinjuring interests in America.In my judgment immediate steps should be taken for the fortification ofHawaii. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify inorder to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard tooverstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed.Laws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Hawaii asa special fund to be expended in the islands for educational and publicbuildings, and for harbor improvements and military and naval defenses.It cannot be too often repeated that our aim must be to develop theterritory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That territory hasserious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but nomeasure of relief can be considered which looks to legislationadmitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to field labor anddomestic service. The status of servility can never again be toleratedon American soil. We cannot concede that the proper solution of itsproblems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a class of laborersdenied admission to the other States and Territories. There areobstacles, and great obstacles, in the way of building up arepresentative American community in the Hawaiian Islands; but it isnot in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty.Many an American Commonwealth has been built up against odds equal tothose that now confront Hawaii.No merely half hearted effort to meet its problems as other Americancommunities have met theirs can be accepted as final. Hawaii shallnever become a territory in which a governing class of rich plantersexists by means of coolie labor. Even if the rate of growth of theTerritory is thereby rendered slower, the growth must only take placeby the admission of immigrants fit in the end to assume the duties andburdens of full American citizenship. Our aim must be to develop theTerritory on the same basis of stable citizenship as exists on thiscontinent.I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitlyconfer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. There is, inmy judgment, no excuse for failure to do this. The harbor of San Juanshould be dredged and improved. The expenses of the Federal Court ofPorto Rico should be met from the Federal Treasury and not from thePorto Rican treasury. The elections in Porto Rico should take placeevery four years, and the Legislature should meet in session every twoyears. The present form of government in Porto Rico, which provides forthe appointment by the President of the members of the ExecutiveCouncil or upper house of the Legislature, has proved satisfactory andhas inspired confidence in property owners and investors. I do not deemit advisable at the present time to change this form in any materialfeature. The problems and needs of the island are industrial andcommercial rather than political.I wish to call the attention of the Congress to one question whichaffects our insular possessions generally; namely, the need of anincreased liberality in the treatment of the whole franchise questionin these islands. In the proper desire to prevent the islands beingexploited by speculators and to have them develop in the interests oftheir own people an error has been made in refusing to grantsufficiently liberal terms to induce the investment of American capitalin the Philippines and in Porto Rico. Elsewhere in this message I havespoken strongly against the jealousy of mere wealth, and especially ofcorporate wealth as such. But it is particularly regrettable to allowany such jealousy to be developed when we are dealing either with ourinsular or with foreign affairs. The big corporation has achieved itspresent position in the business world simply because it is the mosteffective instrument in business competition. In foreign affairs wecannot afford to put our people at a disadvantage with theircompetitors by in any way discriminating against the efficiency of ourbusiness organizations. In the same way we cannot afford to allow ourinsular possessions to lag behind in industrial development from anytwisted jealousy of business success. It is, of course, a mere truismto say that the business interests of the islands will only bedeveloped if it becomes the financial interest of somebody to developthem. Yet this development is one of the things most earnestly to bewished for in the interest of the islands themselves. We have beenpaying all possible heed to the political and educational interests ofthe islands, but, important though these objects are, it is not lessimportant that we should favor their industrial development. TheGovernment can in certain ways help this directly, as by building goodroads; but the fundamental and vital help must be given through thedevelopment of the industries of the islands, and a most efficientmeans to this end is to encourage big American corporations to startindustries in them, and this means to make it advantageous for them todo so. To limit the ownership of mining claims, as has been done in thePhilippines, is absurd. In both the Philippines and Porto Rico thelimit of holdings of land should be largely raised.I earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. Some personshould be chosen who can speak with authority of the needs of theTerritory. The Government should aid in the construction of a railroadfrom the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon River, in American territory. Inmy last two messages I advocated certain additional action on behalf ofAlaska. I shall not now repeat those recommendations, but I shall layall my stress upon the one recommendation of giving to Alaska some oneauthorized to speak for it. I should prefer that the delegate was madeelective, but if this is not deemed wise, then make him appointive. Atany rate, give Alaska some person whose business it shall be to speakwith authority on her behalf to the Congress. The natural resources ofAlaska are great. Some of the chief needs of the peculiarly energetic,self reliant, and typically American white population of Alaska wereset forth in my last message. I also earnestly ask your attention tothe needs of the Alaskan Indians. All Indians who are competent shouldreceive the full rights of American citizenship. It is, for instance, agross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hard working,decent living Indians as the Metlakahtlas the right to obtain licensesas captains, pilots, and engineers; the right to enter mining claims,and to profit by the homestead law. These particular Indians arecivilized and are competent and entitled to be put on the same basiswith the white men round about them.I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one Stateand that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one State. There is noobligation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are mattersof convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission toStatehood. Nothing has taken up more time in the Congress during thepast few years than the question as to the Statehood to be granted tothe four Territories above mentioned, and after careful considerationof all that has been developed in the discussions of the question, Irecommend that they be immediately admitted as two States. There is nojustification for further delay; and the advisability of making thefour Territories into two States has been clearly established.In some of the Territories the legislative assemblies issue licensesfor gambling. The Congress should by law forbid this practice, theharmful results of which are obvious at a glance.The treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama, underwhich the construction of the Panama Canal was made possible, went intoeffect with its ratification by the United States Senate on February23, 1904. The canal properties of the French Canal Company weretransferred to the United States on April 23, 1904, on payment of$40,000,000 to that company. On April 1, 1905, the Commission wasreorganized, and it now consists of Theodore P. Shonts, Chairman;Charles E. Magoon, Benjamin M. Harrod, Rear Admiral Mordecai T.Endicott, Brig. Gen. Peter C. Hains, and Col. Oswald H. Ernst. John F.Stevens was appointed Chief Engineer on July 1 last. Active work incanal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in progress for lessthan a year and a half. During that period two points about the canalhave ceased to be open to debate: First, the question of route; thecanal will be built on the Isthmus of Panama. Second, the question offeasibility; there are no physical obstacles on this route thatAmerican engineering skill will not be able to overcome without seriousdifficulty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within areasonable time and at a reasonable cost. This is virtually theunanimous testimony of the engineers who have investigated the matterfor the Government.The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether thecanal shall be one of several locks above sea level, or at sea levelwith a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before theCongress at an early day the findings of the Advisory Board of Americanand European Engineers, that at my invitation have been considering thesubject, together with the report of the Commission thereon, and suchcomments thereon or recommendations in reference thereto as may seemnecessary.The American people is pledged to the speediest possible constructionof a canal adequate to meet the demands which the commerce of the worldwill make upon it, and I appeal most earnestly to the Congress to aidin the fulfillment of the pledge. Gratifying progress has been madeduring the past year, and especially during the past four months. Thegreater part of the necessary preliminary work has been done. Actualwork of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till theCanal Zone was made a healthful place to live in and to work in. TheIsthmus had to be sanitated first. This task has been so thoroughlyaccomplished that yellow fever has been virtually extirpated from theIsthmus and general health conditions vastly improved. The same methodswhich converted the island of Cuba from a pest hole, which menaced thehealth of the world, into a healthful place of abode, have been appliedon the Isthmus with satisfactory results. There is no reason to doubtthat when the plans for water supply, paving, and sewerage of Panamaand Colon and the large labor camps have been fully carried out, theIsthmus will be, for the tropics, an unusually healthy place of abode.The work is so far advanced now that the health of all those employedin canal work is as well guarded as it is on similar work in thiscountry and elsewhere.In addition to sanitating the Isthmus, satisfactory quarters are beingprovided for employes and an adequate system of supplying them withwholesome food at reasonable prices has been created. Hospitals havebeen established and equipped that are without their superiors of theirkind anywhere. The country has thus been made fit to work in, andprovision has been made for the welfare and comfort of those who are todo the work. During the past year a large portion of the plant withwhich the work is to be done has been ordered. It is confidentlybelieved that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficientproportion of this plant will have been installed to enable us toresume the work of excavation on a large scale.What is needed now and without delay is an appropriation by theCongress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission.The first appropriation of $10,000,000, out of the $135,000,000authorized by the Spooner act, was made three years ago. It is nearlyexhausted. There is barely enough of it remaining to carry thecommission to the end of the year. Unless the Congress shallappropriate before that time all work must cease. To arrest progressfor any length of time now, when matters are advancing sosatisfactorily, would be deplorable. There will be no money with whichto meet pay roll obligations and none with which to meet bills comingdue for materials and supplies; and there will be demoralization of theforces, here and on the Isthmus, now working so harmoniously andeffectively, if there is delay in granting an emergency appropriation.Estimates of the amount necessary will be found in the accompanyingreports of the Secretary of War and the commission.I recommend more adequate provision than has been made heretofore forthe work of the Department of State. Within a few years there has beena very great increase in the amount and importance of the work to bedone by that department, both in Washington and abroad. This has beencaused by the great increase of our foreign trade, the increase ofwealth among our people, which enables them to travel more generallythan heretofore, the increase of American capital which is seekinginvestment in foreign countries, and the growth of our power and weightin the councils of the civilized world. There has been no correspondingincrease of facilities for doing the work afforded to the departmenthaving charge of our foreign relations.Neither at home nor abroad is there a sufficient working force to dothe business properly. In many respects the system which was adequateto the work of twenty five years or even ten years ago, is inadequatenow, and should be changed. Our Consular force should be classified,and appointments should be made to the several classes, with authorityto the Executive to assign the members of each class to duty at suchposts as the interests of the service require, instead of theappointments being made as at present to specified posts. There shouldbe an adequate inspection service, so that the department may be ableto inform itself how the business of each Consulate is being done,instead of depending upon casual private information or rumor. The feesystem should be entirely abolished, and a due equivalent made insalary to the officers who now eke out their subsistence by means offees. Sufficient provision should be made for a clerical force in everyConsulate composed entirely of Americans, instead of the insufficientprovision now made, which compels the employment of great numbers ofcitizens of foreign countries whose services can be obtained for lessmoney. At a large part of our Consulates the office quarters and theclerical force are inadequate to the performance of the onerous dutiesimposed by the recent provisions of our immigration laws as well as byour increasing trade. In many parts of the world the lack of suitablequarters for our embassies, legations, and Consulates detracts from therespect in which our officers ought to be held, and seriously impairstheir weight and influence.Suitable provision should be made for the expense of keeping ourdiplomatic officers more fully informed of what is being done from dayto day in the progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries.The lack of such information, caused by insufficient appropriationsavailable for cable tolls and for clerical and messenger service,frequently puts our officers at a great disadvantage and detracts fromtheir usefulness. The salary list should be readjusted. It does not nowcorrespond either to the importance of the service to be rendered andthe degrees of ability and experience required in the differentpositions, or to the differences in the cost of living. In many casesthe salaries are quite inadequate.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:As a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedentedprosperity; and it is probable that only reckless speculation anddisregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the businessworld can materially mar this prosperity.No Congress in our time has done more good work of importance than thepresent Congress. There were several matters left unfinished at yourlast session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will completebefore your adjournment.I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributingto the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past oneHouse of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but letus prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from makingcontributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly.Another bill which has just past one House of the Congress and which itis urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferringupon the Government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questionsof law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in theDistrict of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course notproposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the meritsshould be set aside. Recently in one district where the Government hadindicted certain persons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, thecourt sustained the defendant\'s demurrer; while in another jurisdictionan indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained bythe court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentencedto imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflictwith each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be anapparent conflict. At present there is no way by which the Governmentcan cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal toa higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any realdecision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage ofthe bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seriouslyhampering the Government in its effort to obtain justice, especiallyagainst wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may alsoprevent the Government from obtaining justice for wage workers who arenot themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment ofan inferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view arecent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees withoutremedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems anabsurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be thejudgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench,to declare a law solemnly enacted by the Congress to be"unconstitutional," and then to deny to the Government the right tohave the Supreme Court definitely decide the question.It is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law oftendepends not upon the passage of acts as to which there is great publicexcitement, but upon the passage of acts of this nature as to whichthere is not much public excitement, because there is little publicunderstanding of their importance, while the interested parties arekeenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance ofenacting into law the particular bill in question is further increasedby the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy ofresorting to the criminal law in those trust and interstate commercecases where such a course offers a reasonable chance of success. Atfirst, as was proper, every effort was made to enforce these laws bycivil proceedings; but it has become increasingly evident that theaction of the Government in finally deciding, in certain cases, toundertake criminal proceedings was justifiable; and though there havebeen some conspicuous failures in these cases, we have had manysuccesses, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect uponevil doers, whether the penalty inflicted was in the shape of fine orimprisonment and penalties of both kinds have already been inflictedby the courts. Of course, where the judge can see his way to inflictthe penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect of the punishment onother offenders is increased; but sufficiently heavy fines accomplishmuch. Judge Holt, of the New York district court, in a recent decisionadmirably stated the need for treating with just severity offenders ofthis kind. His opinion runs in part as follows:\'The Government\'s evidence to establish the defendant\'s guilt wasclear, conclusive, and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. Thetransactions which took place under this illegal contract were verylarge; the amounts of rebates returned were considerable; and theamount of the rebate itself was large, amounting to more than one fifthof the entire tariff charge for the transportation of merchandise fromthis city to Detroit. It is not too much to say, in my opinion, that ifthis business was carried on for a considerable time on thatbasis that is, if this discrimination in favor of this particularshipper was made with an 18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the tariffrate was maintained as against their competitors the result might beand not improbably would be that their competitors would be driven outof business. This crime is one which in its nature is deliberate andpremeditated. I think over a fortnight elapsed between the date ofPalmer\'s letter requesting the reduced rate and the answer of therailroad company deciding to grant it, and then for months afterwardsthis business was carried on and these claims for rebates submittedmonth after month and checks in payment of them drawn month aftermonth. Such a violation of the law, in my opinion, in its essentialnature, is a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common,vulgar crimes which come before criminal courts constantly forpunishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation. Thiscrime in this case was committed by men of education and of largebusiness experience, whose standing in the community was such that theymight have been expected to set an example of obedience to law upon themaintenance of which alone in this country the security of theirproperty depends. It was committed on behalf of a great railroadcorporation, which, like other railroad corporations, has receivedgratuitously from the State large and valuable privileges for thepublic\'s convenience and its own, which performs quasi public functionsand which is charged with the highest obligation in the transaction ofits business to treat the citizens of this country alike, and not tocarry on its business with unjust discriminations between differentcitizens or different classes of citizens. This crime in its nature isone usually done with secrecy, and proof of which it is very difficultto obtain. The interstate commerce act was past in 1887, nearly twentyyears ago. Ever since that time complaints of the granting of rebatesby railroads have been common, urgent, and insistent, and although theCongress has repeatedly past legislation endeavoring to put a stop tothis evil, the difficulty of obtaining proof upon which to bringprosecution in these cases is so great that this is the first case thathas ever been brought in this court, and, as I am formed, this case andone recently brought in Philadelphia are the only cases that have everbeen brought in the eastern part of this country. In fact, but fewcases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, East orWest. Now, under these circumstances, I am forced to the conclusion, ina case in which the proof is so clear and the facts are so flagrant, itis the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some degree becommensurate with the gravity of the offense. As between the twodefendants, in my opinion, the principal penalty should be imposed onthe corporation. The traffic manager in this case, presumably, actedwithout any advantage to himself and without any interest in thetransaction, either by the direct authority or in accordance with whathe understood to be the policy or the wishes of his employer."The sentence of this court in this case is, that the defendantPomeroy, for each of the six offenses upon which he has been convicted,be fined the sum of $1,000, making six fines, amounting in all to thesum of $6,000; and the defendant, The New York Central and Hudson RiverRailroad Company, for each of the six crimes of which it has beenconvicted, be fined the sum of $18,000, making six fines amounting inthe aggregate to the sum of $108,000, and judgment to that effect willbe entered in this case."In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to thevery unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large partfrom the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts ontechnicalities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, andwhere there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure ofsubstantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providingsomething to the effect that:No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civilor criminal, on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the improperadmission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter ofpleading or procedure unless, in the opinion of the court to which theapplication is made, after an examination of the entire cause, it shallaffirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in amiscarriage of justice.In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connectionwith the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawnto the matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions inlabor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whethera law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases wouldstand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislationwould be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogetherto prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathyfor criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seekto destroy life or property by mob violence there should be noimpairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the mostsummary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse ofthe power should be provided against by some such law as I advocatedlast year.In this matter of injunctions there is lodged in the hands of thejudiciary a necessary power which is nevertheless subject to thepossibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised withextreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all men,and condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails touse it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly oroppressively. Of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his officewill enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially byconspiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rights of theoriginal quarrel. There must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder.But there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power as isimplied in forbidding laboring men to strive for their own bettermentin peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely toaid some big corporation in carrying out schemes for its ownaggrandizement. It must be remembered that a preliminary injunction ina labor case, if granted without adequate proof (even when authoritycan be found to support the conclusions of law on which it is founded),may often settle the dispute between the parties; and therefore ifimproperly granted may do irreparable wrong. Yet there are many judgeswho assume a matter of course granting of a preliminary injunction tobe the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such cases; andthere have undoubtedly been flagrant wrongs committed by judges inconnection with labor disputes even within the last few years, althoughI think much less often than in former years. Such judges by theirunwise action immensely strengthen the hands of those who are strivingentirely to do away with the power of injunction; and therefore suchcareless use of the injunctive process tends to threaten its veryexistence, for if the American people ever become convinced that thisprocess is habitually abused, whether in matters affecting labor or inmatters affecting corporations, it will be well nigh impossible toprevent its abolition.It may be the highest duty of a judge at any given moment to disregard,not merely the wishes of individuals of great political or financialpower, but the overwhelming tide of public sentiment; and the judge whodoes thus disregard public sentiment when it is wrong, who brushesaside the plea of any special interest when the pleading is not roundedon righteousness, performs the highest service to the country. Such ajudge is deserving of all honor; and all honor can not be paid to thiswise and fearless judge if we permit the growth of an absurd conventionwhich would forbid any criticism of the judge of another type, whoshows himself timid in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who oninsufficient grounds grants an injunction that does grave injustice, orwho in his capacity as a construer, and therefore in part a maker, ofthe law, in flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of decent government.The judge has a power over which no review can be exercised; he himselfsits in review upon the acts of both the executive and legislativebranches of the Government; save in the most extraordinary cases he isamenable only at the bar of public opinion; and it is unwise tomaintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such powershall neither be exprest nor led.The best judges have ever been foremost to disclaim any immunity fromcriticism. This has been true since the days of the great English LordChancellor Parker, who said: "Let all people be at liberty to know whatI found my judgment upon; that, so when I have given it in any cause,others may be at liberty to judge of me." The proprieties of the casewere set forth with singular clearness and good temper by Judge W. H.Taft, when a United States circuit judge, eleven years ago, in 1895:"The opportunity freely and publicly to criticize judicial action is ofvastly more importance to the body politic than the immunity of courtsand judges from unjust aspersions and attack. Nothing tends more torender judges careful in their decisions and anxiously solicitous to doexact justice than the consciousness that every act of theirs is to besubjected to the intelligent scrutiny and candid criticism of theirfellow men. Such criticism is beneficial in proportion as it is fair,dispassionate, discriminating, and based on a knowledge of sound legalprinciples. The comments made by learned text writers and by the acuteeditors of the various law reviews upon judicial decisions aretherefore highly useful. Such critics constitute more or less impartialtribunals of professional opinion before which each judgment is made tostand or fall on its merits, and thus exert a strong influence tosecure uniformity of decision. But non professional criticism also isby no means without its uses, even if accompanied, as it often is, by adirect attack upon the judicial fairness and motives of the occupantsof the bench; for if the law is but the essence of common sense, theprotest of many average men may evidence a defect in a judicialconclusion, though based on the nicest legal reasoning and profoundestlearning. The two important elements of moral character in a judge arean earnest desire to reach a just conclusion and courage to enforce it.In so far as fear of public comment does not affect the courage of ajudge, but only spurs him on to search his conscience and to reach theresult which approves itself to his inmost heart such comment serves auseful purpose. There are few men, whether they are judges for life orfor a shorter term, who do not prefer to earn and hold the respect ofall, and who can not be reached and made to pause and deliberate byhostile public criticism. In the case of judges having a life tenure,indeed their very independence makes the right freely to comment ontheir decisions of greater importance, because it is the only practicaland available instrument in the hands of a free people to keep suchjudges alive to the reasonable demands of those they serve."On the other hand, the danger of destroying the proper influence ofjudicial decisions by creating unfounded prejudices against the courtsjustifies and requires that unjust attacks shall be met and answered.Courts must ultimately rest their defense upon the inherent strength ofthe opinions they deliver as the ground for their conclusions and musttrust to the calm and deliberate judgment of all the people as theirbest vindication."There is one consideration which should be taken into account by thegood people who carry a sound proposition to an excess in objecting toany criticism of a judge\'s decision. The instinct of the Americanpeople as a whole is sound in this matter. They will not subscribe tothe doctrine that any public servant is to be above all criticism. Ifthe best citizens, those most competent to express their judgment insuch matters, and above all those belonging to the great and honorableprofession of the bar, so profoundly influential in American life, takethe position that there shall be no criticism of a judge under anycircumstances, their view will not be accepted by the American peopleas a whole. In such event the people will turn to, and tend to acceptas justifiable, the intemperate and improper criticism uttered byunworthy agitators. Surely it is a misfortune to leave to such criticsa function, right, in itself, which they are certain to abuse. Just andtemperate criticism, when necessary, is a safeguard against theacceptance by the people as a whole of that intemperate antagonismtowards the judiciary which must be combated by every right thinkingman, and which, if it became widespread among the people at large,would constitute a dire menace to the Republic.In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and theattention of the Nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and aboveall to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, nowin one part of our country, now in another. Each section, North, South,East, or West, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend itstime jeering at the faults of another section; it should be busy tryingto amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption Itis necessary to have an awakened public conscience, and to supplementthis by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in theexecution of the law. When we deal with lynching even mote isnecessary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime ispeculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existingcause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of thehideous crime of rape the most abominable in all the category ofcrimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commissionof this crime by themselves torturing to death the man committing it;thus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial deed, and reducingthemselves to a level with the criminal.Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon; and when mobs begin to lynchfor rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynchfor many other kinds of crimes, so that two thirds of the lynchings arenot for rape at all; while a considerable proportion of the individualslynched are innocent of all crime. Governor Candler, of Georgia, statedon one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a verity that I have,within the last month, saved the lives of half a dozen innocent Negroeswho were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court oflaw in which they were acquitted." As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi,has finely said: "When the rule of a mob obtains, that whichdistinguishes a high civilization is surrendered. The mob which lynchesa negro charged with rape will in a little while lynch a white mansuspected of crime. Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift uphis voice in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that isthreatening the integrity of this Republic." Governor Jelks, ofAlabama, has recently spoken as follows: "The lynching of any personfor whatever crime is inexcusable anywhere it is a defiance of orderlygovernment; but the killing of innocent people under any provocation isinfinitely more horrible; and yet innocent people are likely to diewhen a mob\'s terrible lust is once aroused. The lesson is this: No goodcitizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matterwhat the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is myobservation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people ofthe South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even thebetter elements lend no assistance whatever in ferreting out criminalsof their own color. The respectable colored people must learn not toharbor their criminals, but to assist the officers in bringing them tojustice. This is the larger crime, and it provokes such atrociousoffenses as the one at Atlanta. The two races can never get on untilthere is an understanding on the part of both to make common cause withthe law abiding against criminals of any color."Moreover, where any crime committed by a member of one race against amember of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as ifnot the individual criminal, but the whole race, is attacked, theresult is to exasperate to the highest degree race feeling. There isbut one safe rule in dealing with black men as with white men; it isthe same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poormen; that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed, or hissocial position, with even handed justice on his real worth as a man.White people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the colored raceto treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deservessuch treatment; for it is surely the highest wisdom to encourage in thecolored race all those individuals who are honest, industrious,law abiding, and who therefore make good and safe neighbors andcitizens. Reward or punish the individual on his merits as anindividual. Evil will surely come in the end to both races if wesubstitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members ofthe race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of "socialequality" or "negro domination" involved; only the question ofrelentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man theright to his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as hisown qualities of heart, head, and hand enable him to achieve it.Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race isthe negro criminal, and above all the negro criminal who commits thedreadful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degreean offense against the whole country, and against the colored race inparticular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the lawin hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every suchinfamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape shouldalways be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault withintent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in thediscretion of the court; and provision should be made by which thepunishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; whilethe trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonlyshamed while giving testimony, and that the least possible publicityshall be given to the details.The members of the white race on the other hand should understand thatevery lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands ofcivilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws intoprominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwelltherein. No man can take part in the torture of a human being withouthaving his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching meansjust so much moral deterioration in all the children who have anyknowledge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for thenext generation of Americans.Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under thelaw, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob.There is another matter which has a direct bearing upon this matter oflynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes calls it forth and atother times merely furnishes the excuse for its existence. It is out ofthe question for our people as a whole permanently to rise by treadingdown any of their own number. Even those who themselves for the momentprofit by such maltreatment of their fellows will in the long run alsosuffer. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than, in thefancied interest of one class, to prevent the education of anotherclass. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get agood elementary education, lies at the foundation of our wholepolitical situation. In every community the poorest citizens, those whoneed the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only receivedschool facilities proportioned to the taxes they paid. This is as trueof one portion of our country as of another. It is as true for thenegro as for the white man. The white man, if he is wise, will declineto allow the Negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood withouteducation. Unquestionably education such as is obtained in our publicschools does not do everything towards making a man a good citizen; butit does much. The lowest and most brutal criminals, those for instancewho commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority men who havehad either no education or very little; just as they are almostinvariably men who own no property; for the man who puts money by outof his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually liftedabove mere brutal criminality. Of course the best type of education forthe colored man, taken as a whole, is such education as is conferred inschools like Hampton and Tuskegee; where the boys and girls, the youngmen and young women, are trained industrially as well as in theordinary public school branches. The graduates of these schools turnout well in the great majority of cases, and hardly any of them becomecriminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the formof that brutal violence which invites lynch law. Every graduate ofthese schools and for the matter of that every other colored man orwoman who leads a life so useful and honorable as to win the good willand respect of those whites whose neighbor he or she is, thereby helpsthe whole colored race as it can be helped in no other way; for next tothe negro himself, the man who can do most to help the negro is hiswhite neighbor who lives near him; and our steady effort should be tobetter the relations between the two. Great though the benefit of theseschools has been to their colored pupils and to the colored people, itmay well be questioned whether the benefit, has not been at least asgreat to the white people among whom these colored pupils live afterthey graduate.Be it remembered, furthermore, that the individuals who, whether fromfolly, from evil temper, from greed for office, or in a spirit of merebase demagogy, indulge in the inflammatory and incendiary speeches andwritings which tend to arouse mobs and to bring about lynching, notonly thus excite the mob, but also tend by what criminologists call"suggestion," greatly to increase the likelihood of a repetition of thevery crime against which they are inveighing. When the mob is composedof the people of one race and the man lynched is of another race, themen who in their speeches and writings either excite or justify theaction tend, of course, to excite a bitter race feeling and to causethe people of the opposite race to lose sight of the abominable act ofthe criminal himself; and in addition, by the prominence they give tothe hideous deed they undoubtedly tend to excite in other brutal anddepraved natures thoughts of committing it. Swift, relentless, andorderly punishment under the law is the only way by which criminalityof this type can permanently be supprest.In dealing with both labor and capital, with the questions affectingboth corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more importantto remember than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done bypreachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite aviolent class hatred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wiseand proper movements for the better control of corporations and fordoing away with the abuses connected with wealth, into a campaign ofhysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame tomadness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs andfoolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaignof destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with thoseworking for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, andsometimes masquerade as such reformers. In reality they are the worstenemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors ofsensational slander in newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies ofall men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad inour social and governmental conditions. To preach hatred of the richman as such, to carry on a campaign of slander and invective againsthim, to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest men whose livesare hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permitthem to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached all this is tocommit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthyprinciple and tradition of American national life. Moreover, while suchpreaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certainnotoriety to some of those who take part in it, and may result in thetemporary political success of others, in the long run every suchmovement will either fail or else will provoke a violent reaction,which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought bythe demagog and the agitator, but also in undoing the good that thehonest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully andlaboriously achieved. Corruption is never so rife as in communitieswhere the demagog and the agitator bear full sway, because in suchcommunities all moral bands become loosened, and hysteria andsensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing asbetween man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thusproduced men are sure in the end to turn toward any leader who canrestore order, and then their relief at being free from the intolerableburdens of class hatred, violence, and demagogy is such that they cannot for some time be aroused to indignation against misdeeds by men ofwealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which werein part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for successfor our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane andcool headed, advance along the path marked out last year by this veryCongress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into followingeither that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowestinstincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans againsttheir fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, whoin a spirit of greed, or to accumulate or add to an already hugefortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregardto their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others inorder to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruptionwith the man who debauches others for financial profit; and when hatredis sown the crop which springs up can only be evil.The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, workerswith head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, wholove their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe itto themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be givenpopular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on aplatform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised inthis country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in suchcase democracy is itself on trial, popular self government underrepublican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just asevil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped onedanger avails nothing whatever if we succumb to the other. In the endthe honest man, whether rich or poor, who earns his own living andtries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from theinsincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing,or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob toplunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who, for his ownends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the verywealthy. If we ever let this Government fall into the hands of men ofeither of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America\'spast. Moreover, the demagog and the corruptionist often work hand inhand. There are at this moment wealthy reactionaries of such obtusemorality that they regard the public servant who prosecutes them whenthey violate the law, or who seeks to make them bear their proper shareof the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than theviolent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There isnothing to choose between such a reactionary and such an agitator;fundamentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rightsof others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to anymovement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even justice toall.I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting thenumber of hours of employment of railroad employees. The measure is avery moderate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it.Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily toreduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the generalintroduction of an eight hour day. There are industries in which it isnot possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just as thereare communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be fortheir good, or, if in the Tropics, so situated that there is no analogybetween their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama,for instance, the conditions are in every way so different from whatthey are here that an eight hour day would be absurd; just as it isabsurd, so far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor can notbe employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done byalien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of theUnited States are of so high a grade that alike from the merelyindustrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be ourobject to do what we can in the direction of securing the generalobservance of an eight hour day. Until recently the eight hour law onour Federal statute books has been very scantily observed. Now,however, largely through the instrumentality of the Bureau of Labor, itis being rigidly enforced, and I shall speedily be able to say whetheror not there is need of further legislation in reference thereto; .forour purpose is to see it obeyed in spirit no less than in letter. Halfholidays during summer should be established for Government employees;it is as desirable for wageworkers who toil with their hands as forsalaried officials whose labor is mental that there should be areasonable amount of holiday.The Congress at its last session wisely provided for a truant court forthe District of Columbia; a marked step in advance on the path ofproperly caring for the children. Let me again urge that the Congressprovide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child laborand of the labor of women in the United States. More and more ourpeople are growing to recognize the fact that the questions which arenot merely of industrial but of social importance outweigh all others;and these two questions most emphatically come in the category of thosewhich affect in the most far reaching way the home life of the Nation.The horrors incident to the employment of young children in factoriesor at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. It is true thateach. State must ultimately settle the question in its own way; but athorough official investigation of the matter, with the resultspublished broadcast, would greatly help toward arousing the publicconscience and securing unity of State action in the matter. There is,however, one law on the subject which should be enacted immediately,because there is no need for an investigation in reference thereto, andthe failure to enact it is discreditable to the National Government. Adrastic and thoroughgoing child labor law should be enacted for theDistrict of Columbia and the Territories.Among the excellent laws which the Congress past at the last sessionwas an employers\' liability law. It was a marked step in advance to getthe recognition of employers\' liability on the statute books; but thelaw did not go far enough. In spite of all precautions exercised byemployers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths involved innearly every line of business connected with the mechanic arts. Thisinevitable sacrifice of life may be reduced to a minimum, but it cannot be completely eliminated. It is a great social injustice to compelthe employee, or rather the family of the killed or disabled victim, tobear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words,society shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereasthe injury comes from what may be called the legitimate risks of thetrade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of industryto the actual conditions under which that industry is carried on,should be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit ofwhich the industry is carried on that is, by those who profit by theindustry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the employer he willpromptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production andassess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It istherefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "riskof a trade" upon the employer. Neither the Federal law, nor, as far asI am informed, the State laws dealing with the question of employers\'liability are sufficiently thoroughgoing. The Federal law should ofcourse include employees in navy yards, arsenals, and the like.The commission appointed by the President October 16, 1902, at therequest of both the anthracite coal operators and miners, to inquireinto, consider, and pass upon the questions in controversy inconnection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvaniaand the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report,findings, and award exprest the belief "that the State and Federalgovernments should provide the machinery for what may be called thecompulsory investigation of controversies between employers andemployees when they arise." This expression of belief is deserving ofthe favorable consideration of the Congress and the enactment of itsprovisions into law. A bill has already been introduced to this end.Records show that during the twenty years from January 1, 1881, to,December 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117,509 establishments,and 6,105,694 employees were thrown out of employment. During the sameperiod there were 1,005 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000establishments, throwing over one million people out of employment.These strikes and lockouts involved an estimated loss to employees of$307,000,000 and to employers of $143,000,000, a total of $450,000,000.The public suffered directly and indirectly probably as greatadditional loss. But the money loss, great as it was, did not measurethe anguish and suffering endured by the wives and children ofemployees whose pay stopt when their work stopt, or the disastrouseffect of the strike or lockout upon the business of employers, or theincrease in the cost of products and the inconvenience and loss to thepublic.Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had theparties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudicedbody representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons fortheir contention. In most instances the dispute would doubtless befound to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other\'s rights,aggravated by an unwillingness of either party to accept as true thestatements of the other as to the justice or injustice of the mattersin dispute. The exercise of a judicial spirit by a disinterested bodyrepresenting the Federal Government, such as would be provided by acommission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create anatmosphere of friendliness and conciliation between contending parties;and the giving each side an equal opportunity to present fully its casein the presence of the other would prevent many disputes fromdeveloping into serious strikes or lockouts, and, in other cases, wouldenable the commission to persuade the opposing parties to come toterms.In this age of great corporate and labor combinations, neitheremployers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of thestronger party to a dispute, regardless of the righteousness of theirrespective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line ofsecuring recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public hasitself an interest which can not wisely be disregarded; an interest notmerely of general convenience, for the question of a just and properpublic policy must also be considered. In all legislation of this kindit is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actualresults; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for thedecisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legalfashion, and yet would give a chance for public opinion to crystallizeand thus to exert its full force for the right.It is not wise that the Nation should alienate its remaining coallands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands whichthe Geological Survey has indicated as containing, or in allprobability containing, coal. The question, however, can be properlysettled only by legislation, which in my judgment should provide forthe withdrawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certainespecial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the UnitedStates, which should not, however, attempt to work them, but permitthem to be worked by private individuals under a royalty system, theGovernment keeping such control as to permit it to see that noexcessive price was charged consumers. It would, of course, be asnecessary to supervise the rates charged by the common carriers totransport the product as the rates charged by those who mine it; andthe supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carriers, sothat they shall in no way favor one competitor at the expense ofanother. The withdrawal of these coal lands would constitute a policyanalogous to that which has been followed in withdrawing the forestlands from ordinary settlement. The coal, like the forests, should betreated as the property of the public and its disposal should be underconditions which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole.The present Congress has taken long strides in the direction ofsecuring proper supervision and control by the National Government overcorporations engaged in interstate business and the enormous majorityof corporations of any size are engaged in interstate business. Thepassage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passageof the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and renderingmore effective national control over the beef packing industry, mark animportant advance in the proper direction. In the short session it willperhaps be difficult to do much further along this line; and it may bebest to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number ofmonths before endeavoring to increase their scope, because onlyoperation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomingsand thus give opportunity to define what further remedial legislationis needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable inconnection with the packing house inspection law to provide for puttinga date on the label and for charging the cost of inspection to thepackers. All these laws have already justified their enactment. Theinterstate commerce law, for instance, has rather amusingly falsifiedthe predictions, both of those who asserted that it would ruin therailroads and of those who asserted that it did not go far enough andwould accomplish nothing. During the last five months the railroadshave shown increased earnings and some of them unusual dividends; whileduring the same period the mere taking effect of the law has producedan unprecedented, a hitherto unheard of, number of voluntary reductionsin freights and fares by the railroads. Since the founding of theCommission there has never been a time of equal length in whichanything like so many reduced tariffs have been put into effect. OnAugust 27, for instance, two days before the new law went into effect,the Commission received notices of over five thousand separate tariffswhich represented reductions from previous rates.It must not be supposed, however, that with the passage of these lawsit will be possible to stop progress along the line of increasing thepower of the National Government over the use of capital interstatecommerce. For example, there will ultimately be need of enlarging thepowers of the Interstate Commerce Commission along several differentlines, so as to give it a larger and more efficient control over therailroads.It can not too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shownthe impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundreddifferent State legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the wayof dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusivelywithin the limits of any one State. In some method, whether by anational license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that atan early date, a far more complete control than at present over thesegreat corporations a control that will among other things prevent theevils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel thedisclosure by each big corporation of its stockholders and of itsproperties and business, whether owned directly or through subsidiaryor affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to thesecuring of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expensewhether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers.Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, butso to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm tothe people. The reactionary or ultraconservative apologists for themisuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a steptoward socialism. As a matter of fact it is these reactionaries andultraconservatives who are themselves most potent in increasingsocialistic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting theconsequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent wrong, isto remedy the 20 per cent of evil as to which the agitation is wellrounded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for thegovernment ownership of railways is to secure by the Government onbehalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation ofthe great interstate common carriers as will do away with the evilswhich give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidoteto the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as suchis to secure by proper legislation and executive action the abolitionof the grave abuses which actually do obtain in connection with thebusiness use of wealth under our present system or rather nosystem of failure to exercise any adequate control at all. Somepersons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would doaway with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf individualeffort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fail toput a premium upon individual initiative, individual capacity andeffort; upon the energy, character, and foresight which it is soimportant to encourage in the individual. But as a matter of fact thedeadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of itsextreme form communism, and the destruction of individual characterwhich they would bring about, are in part achieved by the whollyunregulated competition which results in a single individual orcorporation rising at the expense of all others until his or its riseeffectually checks all competition and reduces former competitors to aposition of utter inferiority and subordination.In enacting and enforcing such legislation as this Congress already hasto its credit, we are working on a coherent plan, with the steadyendeavor to secure the needed reform by the joint action of themoderate men, the plain men who do not wish anything hysterical ordangerous, but who do intend to deal in resolute common sense fashionwith the real and great evils of the present system. The reactionariesand the violent extremists show symptoms of joining hands against us.Both assert, for instance, that, if logical, we should go to governmentownership of railroads and the like; the reactionaries, because on suchan issue they think the people would stand with them, while theextremists care rather to preach discontent and agitation than toachieve solid results. As a matter of fact, our position is as remotefrom that of the Bourbon reactionary as from that of the impracticableor sinister visionary. We hold that the Government should not conductthe business of the nation, but that it should exercise suchsupervision as will insure its being conducted in the interest of thenation. Our aim is, so far as may be, to secure, for all decent, hardworking men, equality of opportunity and equality of burden.The actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to prohibitall combination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective.Combination of capital like combination of labor is a necessary elementof our present industrial system. It is not possible completely toprevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention would dodamage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try toprevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequatecontrol and supervision of the combinations as to prevent theirinjuring the public, or existing in such form as inevitably to threateninjury for the mere fact that a combination has secured practicallycomplete control of a necessary of life would under any circumstancesshow that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to thepublic interest. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbidall combinations, instead of sharply discriminating between thosecombinations which do good and those combinations which do evil.Rebates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers(as was shown in the investigation of the Standard Oil Company and ashas been shown since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugartrusts) as to the initiative of big railroads. Often railroads wouldlike to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper frommaintaining improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and ofthe general public. Such a combination, instead of being forbidden bylaw, should be favored. In other words, it should be permitted torailroads to make agreements, provided these agreements were sanctionedby the Interstate Commerce Commission and were published. With thesetwo conditions complied with it is impossible to see what harm such acombination could do to the public at large. It is a public evil tohave on the statute books a law incapable of full enforcement becauseboth judges and juries realize that its full enforcement would destroythe business of the country; for the result is to make decent railroadmen violators of the law against their will, and to put a premium onthe behavior of the wilful wrongdoers. Such a result in turn tends tothrow the decent man and the wilful wrongdoer into close association,and in the end to drag down the former to the latter\'s level; for theman who becomes a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tends to lose allrespect for law and to be willing to break it in many ways. No morescathing condemnation could be visited upon a law than is contained inthe words of the Interstate Commerce Commission when, in commentingupon the fact that the numerous joint traffic associations dotechnically violate the law, they say: "The decision of the UnitedStates Supreme Court in the Trans Missouri case and the Joint TrafficAssociation case has produced no practical effect upon the railwayoperations of the country. Such associations, in fact, exist now asthey did before these decisions, and with the same general effect. Injustice to all parties, we ought probably to add that it is difficultto see how our interstate railways could be operated with due regard tothe interest of the shipper and the railway without concerted action ofthe kind afforded through these associations."This means that the law as construed by the Supreme Court is such thatthe business of the country can not be conducted without breaking it. Irecommend that you give careful and early consideration to thissubject, and if you find the opinion of the Interstate CommerceCommission justified, that you amend the law so as to obviate the evildisclosed.The question of taxation is difficult in any country, but it isespecially difficult in ours with its Federal system of government.Some taxes should on every ground be levied in a small district for usein that district. Thus the taxation of real estate is peculiarly onefor the immediate locality in which the real estate is found. Again,there is no more legitimate tax for any State than a tax on thefranchises conferred by that State upon street railroads and similarcorporations which operate wholly within the State boundaries,sometimes in one and sometimes in several municipalities or other minordivisions of the State. But there are many kinds of taxes which canonly be levied by the General Government so as to produce the bestresults, because, among other reasons, the attempt to impose them inone particular State too often results merely in driving thecorporation or individual affected to some other locality or otherState. The National Government has long derived its chief revenue froma tariff on imports and from an internal or excise tax. In addition tothese there is every reason why, when next our system of taxation isrevised, the National Government should impose a graduated inheritancetax, and, if possible, a graduated income tax. The man of great wealthowes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives specialadvantages from the mere existence of government. Not only should herecognize this obligation in the way he leads his daily life and in theway he earns and spends his money, but it should also be recognized bythe way in which he pays for the protection the State gives him. On theone hand, it is desirable that he should assume his full and propershare of the burden of taxation; on the other hand, it is quite asnecessary that in this kind of taxation, where the men who vote the taxpay but little of it, there should be clear recognition of the dangerof inaugurating any such system save in a spirit of entire justice andmoderation. Whenever we, as a people, undertake to remodel our taxationsystem along the lines suggested, we must make it clear beyondperadventure that our aim is to distribute the burden of supporting theGovernment more equitably than at present; that we intend to treat richman and poor man on a basis of absolute equality, and that we regard itas equally fatal to true democracy to do or permit injustice to the oneas to do or permit injustice to the other.I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and carefulstudy in order that the people may become familiar with what isproposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding withwisdom and self restraint, and may make up their minds just how farthey are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislatorscan work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that in thenear future our national legislators should enact a law providing for agraduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of dutyshould be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift,bequest, or devise to any individual or corporation. It may be well tomake the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefited is remoteof kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax shouldincrease very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any oneindividual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirableto encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift andambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave hischildren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax verysmall on moderate amounts of property left; because the prime objectshould be to put a constantly increasing burden on the inheritance ofthose swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to thiscountry to perpetuate.There can be no question of the ethical propriety of the Governmentthus determining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritanceshould be received. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as anincident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise orgift of the enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary atpresent to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction shouldbe gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while itmight be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need notapproximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase bygraduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be.This species of tax has again and again been imposed, although onlytemporarily, by the National Government. It was first imposed by theact of July 6, 1797, when the makers of the Constitution were alive andat the head of affairs. It was a graduated tax; though small in amount,the rate was increased with the amount left to any individual,exceptions being made in the case of certain close kin. A similar taxwas again imposed by the act of July 1, 1862; a minimum sum of onethousand dollars in personal property being excepted from taxation, thetax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness of kin. Thewar revenue act of June 13, 1898, provided for an inheritance tax onany sum exceeding the value of ten thousand dollars, the rate of thetax increasing both in accordance with the amounts left and inaccordance with the legatee\'s remoteness of kin. The Supreme Court hasheld that the succession tax imposed at the time of the Civil War wasnot a direct tax but an impost or excise which was both constitutionaland valid. More recently the Court, in an opinion delivered by Mr.Justice White, which contained an exceedingly able and elaboratediscussion of the powers of the Congress to impose death duties,sustained the constitutionality of the inheritance tax feature of thewar revenue act of 1898.In its incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue,an income tax stands on an entirely different footing from aninheritance tax; because it involves no question of the perpetuation offortunes swollen to an unhealthy size. The question is in its essence aquestion of the proper adjustment of burdens to benefits. As the lawnow stands it is undoubtedly difficult to devise a national income taxwhich shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossibleis another question; and if possible it is most certainly desirable.The first purely income tax law was past by the Congress in 1861, butthe most important law dealing with the subject was that of 1894. Thisthe court held to be unconstitutional.The question is undoubtedly very intricate, delicate, and troublesome.The decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is thelaw of the land, and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyedby all good citizens. Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt bythe court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when consideredtogether with the previous decisions on the subject, may perhapsindicate the possibility of devising a constitutional income tax lawwhich shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. Thedifficulty of amending the Constitution is so great that only realnecessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made indealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control bythe National Government over the use of corporate wealth in interstatebusiness, to devise legislation which without such action shall attainthe desired end; but if this fails, there will ultimately be noalternative to a constitutional amendment.It would be impossible to overstate (though it is of course difficultquantitatively to measure) the effect upon a nation\'s growth togreatness of what may be called organized patriotism, which necessarilyincludes the substitution of a national feeling for mere local pride;with as a resultant a high ambition for the whole country. No countrycan develop its full strength so long as the parts which make up thewhole each put a feeling of loyalty to the part above the feeling ofloyalty to the whole. This is true of sections and it is just as trueof classes. The industrial and agricultural classes must work together,capitalists and wageworkers must work together, if the best work ofwhich the country is capable is to be done. It is probable that athoroughly efficient system of education comes next to the influence ofpatriotism in bringing about national success of this kind. Our federalform of government, so fruitful of advantage to our people in certainways, in other ways undoubtedly limits our national effectiveness. Itis not possible, for instance, for the National Government to take thelead in technical industrial education, to see that the public schoolsystem of this country develops on all its technical, industrial,scientific, and commercial sides. This must be left primarily to theseveral States. Nevertheless, the National Government has control ofthe schools of the District of Columbia, and it should see that theseschools promote and encourage the fullest development of the scholarsin both commercial and industrial training. The commercial trainingshould in one of its branches deal with foreign trade. The industrialtraining is even more important. It should be one of our prime objectsas a Nation, so far as feasible, constantly to work toward putting themechanic, the wageworker who works with his hands, on a higher plane ofefficiency and reward, so as to increase his effectiveness in theeconomic world, and the dignity, the remuneration, and the power of hisposition in the social world. Unfortunately, at present the effect ofsome of the work in the public schools is in the exactly oppositedirection. If boys and girls are trained merely in literaryaccomplishments, to the total exclusion of industrial, manual, andtechnical training, the tendency is to unfit them for industrial workand to make them reluctant to go into it, or unfitted to do well ifthey do go into it. This is a tendency which should be strenuouslycombated. Our industrial development depends largely upon technicaleducation, including in this term all industrial education, from thatwhich fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter, orblacksmith, to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineeringfeat. The skilled mechanic, the skilled workman, can best become suchby technical industrial education. The far reaching usefulness ofinstitutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering is nowuniversally acknowledged, and no less far reaching is the effect of agood building or mechanical trades school, a textile, or watch making,or engraving school. All such training must develop not only manualdexterity but industrial intelligence. In international rivalry thiscountry does not have to fear the competition of pauper labor as muchas it has to fear the educated labor of specially trained competitors;and we should have the education of the hand, eye, and brain which willfit us to meet such competition.In every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with hishands and who must (we hope in a constantly increasing measure) alsotoil with his brain. Under the Constitution the National Legislaturecan do but little of direct importance for his welfare save where he isengaged in work which permits it to act under the interstate commerceclause of the Constitution; and this is one reason why I so earnestlyhope that both the legislative and judicial branches of the Governmentwill construe this clause of the Constitution in the broadest possiblemanner. We can, however, in such a matter as industrial training, insuch a matter as child labor and factory laws, set an example to theStates by enacting the most advanced legislation that can wisely beenacted for the District of Columbia.The only other persons whose welfare is as vital to the welfare of thewhole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers ofthe soil, the farmers. It is a mere truism to say that no growth ofcities, no growth of wealth, no industrial development can atone forany falling off in the character and standing of the farmingpopulation. During the last few decades this fact has been recognizedwith ever increasing clearness. There is no longer any failure torealize that farming, at least in certain branches, must become atechnical and scientific profession. This means that there must be opento farmers the chance for technical and scientific training, nottheoretical merely but of the most severely practical type. The farmerrepresents a peculiarly high type of American citizenship, and he musthave the same chance to rise and develop as other American citizenshave. Moreover, it is exactly as true of the farmer, as it is of thebusiness man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of theNation of which he forms a part must be founded not alone on materialprosperity but upon high moral, mental, and physical development. Thiseducation of the farmer self education by preference but alsoeducation from the outside, as with all other men is peculiarlynecessary here in the United States, where the frontier conditions evenin the newest States have now nearly vanished, where there must be asubstitution of a more intensive system of cultivation for the oldwasteful farm management, and where there must be a better businessorganization among the farmers themselves.Several factors must cooperate in the improvement of the farmer\'scondition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widestpossible sense in the sense which keeps ever in view the intimaterelationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Inall education we should widen our aims. It is a good thing to produce acertain number of trained scholars and students; but the educationsuperintended by the State must seek rather to produce a hundred goodcitizens than merely one scholar, and it must be turned now and thenfrom the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself.This is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out againand again by all observers most competent to pass practical judgment onthe problems of our country life. All students now realize thateducation must seek to train the executive powers of young people andto confer more real significance upon the phrase "dignity of labor,"and to prepare the pupils so that, in addition to each developing inthe highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may togetherhelp create a right public opinion, and show in many ways social andcooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the businessworld; and it has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. Itis no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grangemovement is good in itself and is capable of a well nigh infinitefurther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimatebusiness. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers formutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological.Moreover, while in the long run voluntary efforts will prove moreefficacious than government assistance, while the farmers mustprimarily do most for themselves, yet the Government can also do much.The Department of Agriculture has broken new ground in many directions,and year by year it finds how it can improve its methods and developfresh usefulness. Its constant effort is to give the governmentalassistance in the most effective way; that is, through associations offarmers rather than to or through individual farmers. It is alsostriving to coordinate its work with the agricultural departments ofthe several States, and so far as its own work is educational tocoordinate it with the work of other educational authorities.Agricultural education is necessarily based upon general education, butour agricultural educational institutions are wisely specializingthemselves, making their courses relate to the actual teaching of theagricultural and kindred sciences to young country people or young citypeople who wish to live in the country.Great progress has already been made among farmers by the creation offarmers\' institutes, of dairy associations, of breeders\' associations,horticultural associations, and the like. A striking example of how theGovernment and the farmers can cooperate is shown in connection withthe menace offered to the cotton growers of the Southern States by theadvance of the boll weevil. The Department is doing all it can toorganize the farmers in the threatened districts, just as it has beendoing all it can to organize them in aid of its work to eradicate thecattle fever tick in the South. The Department can and will cooperatewith all such associations, and it must have their help if its own workis to be done in the most efficient style.Much is now being done for the States of the Rocky Mountains and GreatPlains through the development of the national policy of irrigation andforest preservation; no Government policy for the betterment of ourinternal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Theforests of the White Mountains and Southern Appalachian regions shouldalso be preserved; and they can not be unless the people of the Statesin which they lie, through their representatives in the Congress,secure vigorous action by the National Government.I invite the attention of the Congress to the estimate of the Secretaryof War for an appropriation to enable him to begin the preliminary workfor the construction of a memorial amphitheater at Arlington. The GrandArmy of the Republic in its national encampment has urged the erectionof such an amphitheater as necessary for the proper observance OfMemorial Day and as a fitting monument to the soldier and sailor deadburied there. In this I heartily concur and commend the matter to thefavorable consideration of the Congress.I am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutionalamendment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriageand divorce should be relegated to the authority of the NationalCongress. At present the wide differences in the laws of the differentStates on this subject result in scandals and abuses; and surely thereis nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation, nothingaround which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard,as the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good fromevery standpoint. In particular it would be good because it wouldconfer on the Congress the power at once to deal radically andefficiently with polygamy; and this should be done whether or notmarriage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper toleave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several States.Power to deal with it should be conferred on the National Government.When home ties are loosened; when men and women cease to regard aworthy family life, with all its duties fully performed, and all itsresponsibilities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evildays for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land,and classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below thedeath rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilfulsterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from the standpoint ofthe human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death,race death; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which is themore dreadful exactly in proportion as the men and women guilty thereofare in other respects, in character, and bodily and mental powers,those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see thefathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homesmade happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primaryduties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any othercause, and retain his or her self respect.Let me once again call the attention of the Congress to two subjectsconcerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. Oneis the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a lawembodying in substance the views, or a major part of the views, exprestin the report on this subject laid before the House at its last sessionwill be past. I am well aware that in former years objectionablemeasures have been proposed in reference to the encouragement ofAmerican shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed measure is asnearly unobjectionable as any can be. It will of course benefitprimarily our seaboard States, such as Maine, Louisiana, andWashington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefitsall; just as Government aid to irrigation and forestry in the West isreally of benefit, not only to the Rocky Mountain States, but to allour country. If it prove impracticable to enact a law for theencouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should bemade for better communication with South America, notably for fast maillines to the chief South American ports. It is discreditable to us thatour business people, for lack of direct communication in the shape oflines of steamers with South America, should in that great sistercontinent be at a disadvantage compared to the business people ofEurope.I especially call your attention to the second subject, the conditionof our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a greatpurpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country; andwithin ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capitafrom $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulatingthat additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each cropseason emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be arevision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incurliability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there hasbeen a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30per cent; and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding sixmonths. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise actionput a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse thansuch fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the uncertaintyfelt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercialinterests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for callmoney in New York attract money from the interior banks into thespeculative field; this depletes the fund that would otherwise beavailable for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced topay abnormal rates; so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increasedinterest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country.The mere statement of these has shows that our present system isseriously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however,many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration becausethey are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to,disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any planwhich would materially impair the value of the United States 2 per centbonds now pledged to secure circulations, the issue of which was madeunder conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not pressany especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expertcommittees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible andwhich certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedlybrought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treasury, theessential features of which have been approved by many prominentbankers and business men. According to this plan national banks shouldbe permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notesof a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drivethe notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would notpermit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but tomeet the emergency presented by times of stringency.I do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it toemphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some systemwhich shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoidall possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan wouldtend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which nowobtain in the New York market; for at present there is too muchcurrency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumulation at NewYork tempts bankers to lend it at low rates for speculative purposes;whereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgentneed for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It mustnever be forgotten that this question concerns business men generallyquite as much as bankers; especially is this true of stockmen, farmers,and business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of theyear the difference in interest rates between the East and the West isfrom 6 to 10 per cent, whereas in Canada the corresponding differenceis but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the interests ofwestern and southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests ofNew York or Chicago bankers; and must be drawn from the standpoints ofthe farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of thecity banker and the country banker.The law should be amended so as specifically to provide that the fundsderived from customs duties may be treated by the Secretary of theTreasury as he treats funds obtained under the internal revenue laws.There should be a considerable increase in bills of smalldenominations. Permission should be given banks, if necessary undersettled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amountthan three millions a month.I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for orelse absolute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. Noharm will come to any American industry; and while there will be somesmall but real material benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit willcome by the showing made as to our purpose to do all in our power fortheir welfare. So far our action in the Philippines has been abundantlyjustified, not mainly and indeed not primarily because of the addeddignity it has given us as a nation by proving that we are capablehonorably and efficiently to bear the international burdens which amighty people should bear, but even more because of the immense benefitthat has come to the people of the Philippine Islands. In these islandswe are steadily introducing both liberty and order, to a greater degreethan their people have ever before known. We have secured justice. Wehave provided an efficient police force, and have put down ladronism.Only in the islands of Leyte and Samar is the authority of ourGovernment resisted and this by wild mountain tribes under thesuperstitious inspiration of fakirs and pseudo religions leaders. Weare constantly increasing the measure of liberty accorded theislanders, and next spring, if conditions warrant, we shall take agreat stride forward in testing their capacity for self government bysummoning the first Filipino legislative assembly; and the way in whichthey stand this test will largely determine whether the self governmentthus granted will be increased or decreased; for if we have erred atall in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly in thedirection of granting a large measure of self government. We arebuilding roads. We have, for the immeasurable good of the people,arranged for the building of railroads. Let us also see to it that theyare given free access to our markets. This nation owes no moreimperative duty to itself and mankind than the duty of managing theaffairs of all the islands under the American flag the Philippines,Porto Rico, and Hawaii so as to make it evident that it is in everyway to their advantage that the flag should fly over them.American citizenship should be conferred on the citizens of Porto Rico.The harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should be dredged and improved.The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from theFederal Treasury. The administration of the affairs of Porto Rico,together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii, and our other insularpossessions, should all be directed under one executive department; bypreference the Department of State or the Department of War.The needs of Hawaii are peculiar; every aid should be given theislands; and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along thelines of a community of small freeholders, not of great planters withcoolie tilled estates. Situated as this Territory is, in the middle ofthe Pacific, there are duties imposed upon this small community whichdo not fall in like degree or manner upon any other American community.This warrants our treating it differently from the way in which wetreat Territories contiguous to or surrounded by sister Territories orother States, and justifies the setting aside of a portion of ourrevenues to be expended for educational and internal improvementstherein. Hawaii is now making an effort to secure immigration fit inthe end to assume the duties and burdens of full American citizenship,and whenever the leaders in the various industries of those islandsfinally adopt our ideals and heartily join our administration inendeavoring to develop a middle class of substantial citizens, a waywill then be found to deal with the commercial and industrial problemswhich now appear to them so serious. The best Americanism is that whichaims for stability and permanency of prosperous citizenship, ratherthan immediate returns on large masses of capital.Alaska\'s needs have been partially met, but there must be a completereorganization of the governmental system, as I have before indicatedto you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens whodwell on the shores of Puget Sound with characteristic energy arearranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Itsspecial aims include the upbuilding of Alaska and the development ofAmerican commerce on the Pacific Ocean. This exposition, in itspurposes and scope, should appeal not only to the people of the Pacificslope, but to the people of the United States at large. Alaska since itwas bought has yielded to the Government eleven millions of dollars ofrevenue, and has produced nearly three hundred millions of dollars ingold, furs, and fish. When properly developed it will become in largedegree a land of homes. The countries bordering the Pacific Ocean havea population more numerous than that of all the countries of Europe;their annual foreign commerce amounts to over three billions ofdollars, of which the share of the United States is some seven hundredmillions of dollars. If this trade were thoroughly understood andpushed by our manufacturers and producers, the industries not only ofthe Pacific slope, but of all our country, and particularly of ourcotton growing States, would be greatly benefited. Of course, in orderto get these benefits, we must treat fairly the countries with which wetrade.It is a mistake, and it betrays a spirit of foolish cynicism, tomaintain that all international governmental action is, and must everbe, based upon mere selfishness, and that to advance ethical reasonsfor such action is always a sign of hypocrisy. This is no morenecessarily true of the action of governments than of the action ofindividuals. It is a sure sign of a base nature always to ascribe basemotives for the actions of others. Unquestionably no nation can affordto disregard proper considerations of self interest, any more than aprivate individual can so do. But it is equally true that the averageprivate individual in any really decent community does many actionswith reference to other men in which he is guided, not byself interest, but by public spirit, by regard for the rights ofothers, by a disinterested purpose to do good to others, and to raisethe tone of the community as a whole. Similarly, a really great nationmust often act, and as a matter of fact often does act, toward othernations in a spirit not in the least of mere self interest, but payingheed chiefly to ethical reasons; and as the centuries go by thisdisinterestedness in international action, this tendency of theindividuals comprising a nation to require that nation to act withjustice toward its neighbors, steadily grows and strengthens. It isneither wise nor right for a nation to disregard its own needs, and itis foolish and may be wicked to think that other nations willdisregard theirs. But it is wicked for a nation only to regard its owninterest, and foolish to believe that such is the sole motive thatactuates any other nation. It should be our steady aim to raise theethical standard of national action just as we strive to raise theethical standard of individual action.Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat withjustice and good will all immigrants who come here under the law.Whether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether theycome from England or Germany, Russia, Japan, or Italy, matters nothing.All we have a right to question is the man\'s conduct. If he is honestand upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with the State, thenhe is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need toremember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure markof a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate againstor in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully andwho is conducting himself properly. To remember this is incumbent onevery American citizen, and it is of course peculiarly incumbent onevery Government official, whether of the nation or of the severalStates.I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and thereassumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadicand is limited to a very few places. Nevertheless, it is mostdiscreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravestconsequences to the nation. The friendship between the United Statesand Japan has been continuous since the time, over half a century ago,when Commodore Perry, by his expedition to Japan, first opened theislands to western civilization. Since then the growth of Japan hasbeen literally astounding. There is not only nothing to parallel it,but nothing to approach it in the history of civilized mankind. Japanhas a glorious and ancient past. Her civilization is older than that ofthe nations of northern Europe the nations from whom the people of theUnited States have chiefly sprung. But fifty years ago Japan\'sdevelopment was still that of the Middle Ages. During that fifty yearsthe progress of the country in every walk in life has been a marvel tomankind, and she now stands as one of the greatest of civilizednations; great in the arts of war and in the arts of peace; great inmilitary, in industrial, in artistic development and achievement.Japanese soldiers and sailors have shown themselves equal in combat toany of whom history makes note. She has produced great generals andmighty admirals; her fighting men, afloat and ashore, show all theheroic courage, the unquestioning, unfaltering loyalty, the splendidindifference to hardship and death, which marked the Loyal Ronins; andthey show also that they possess the highest ideal of patriotism.Japanese artists of every kind see their products eagerly sought for inall lands. The industrial and commercial development of Japan has beenphenomenal; greater than that of any other country during the sameperiod. At the same time the advance in science and philosophy is noless marked. The admirable management of the Japanese Red Cross duringthe late war, the efficiency and humanity of the Japanese officials,nurses, and doctors, won the respectful admiration of all acquaintedwith the facts. Through the Red Cross the Japanese people sent over$100,000 to the sufferers of San Francisco, and the gift was acceptedwith gratitude by our people. The courtesy of the Japanese, nationallyand individually, has become proverbial. To no other country has therebeen such an increasing number of visitors from this land as to Japan.In return, Japanese have come here in great numbers. They are welcome,socially and intellectually, in all our colleges and institutions ofhigher learning, in all our professional and social bodies. TheJapanese have won in a single generation the right to stand abreast ofthe foremost and most enlightened peoples of Europe and America; theyhave won on their own merits and by their own exertions the right totreatment on a basis of full and frank equality. The overwhelming massof our people cherish a lively regard and respect for the people ofJapan, and in almost every quarter of the Union the stranger from Japanis treated as he deserves; that is, he is treated as the stranger fromany part of civilized Europe is and deserves to be treated. But hereand there a most unworthy feeling has manifested itself toward theJapanese the feeling that has been shown in shutting them out from thecommon schools in San Francisco, and in mutterings against them in oneor two other places, because of their efficiency as workers. To shutthem out from the public schools is a wicked absurdity, when there areno first class colleges in the land, including the universities andcolleges of California, which do not gladly welcome Japanese studentsand on which Japanese students do not reflect credit. We have as muchto learn from Japan as Japan has to learn from us; and no nation is fitto teach unless it is also willing to learn. Throughout Japan Americansare well treated, and any failure on the part of Americans at home totreat the Japanese with a like courtesy and consideration is by just somuch a confession of inferiority in our civilization.Our nation fronts on the Pacific, just as it fronts on the Atlantic. Wehope to play a constantly growing part in the great ocean of theOrient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercialdevelopment in our dealings with Asia; and it is out of the questionthat we should permanently have such development unless we freely andgladly extend to other nations the same measure of justice and goodtreatment which we expect to receive in return. It is only a very smallbody of our citizens that act badly. Where the Federal Government haspower it will deal summarily with any such. Where the several Stateshave power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly withsuch conduct, or else this small body of wrongdoers may bring shameupon the great mass of their innocent and right thinking fellows thatis, upon our nation as a whole. Good manners should be an internationalno less than an individual attribute. I ask fair treatment for theJapanese as I would ask fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen,Frenchmen, Russians, or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity andcivilization. I ask it as due to ourselves because we must actuprightly toward all men.I recommend to the Congress that an act be past specifically providingfor the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to becomeAmerican citizens. One of the great embarrassments attending theperformance of our international obligations is the fact that theStatutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail togive to the National Government sufficiently ample power, throughUnited States courts and by the use of the Army and Navy, to protectaliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which arethe law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminaland civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to asto enable the President, acting for the United States Government, whichis responsible in our international relations, to enforce the rights ofaliens under treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done bythe Federal Government toward this end, and in the matter now before meaffecting the Japanese everything that it is in my power to do will bedone, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United Stateswhich I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however,be no particle of doubt as to the power of the National Governmentcompletely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations.The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawlessviolence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us intowar. That city by itself would be powerless to make defense against theforeign power thus assaulted, and if independent of this Government itwould never venture to perform or permit the performance of the actscomplained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect theoffending city or the offending community lies in the hands of theUnited States Government. It is unthinkable that we should continue apolicy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crimeagainst a friendly nation, and the United States Government limited,not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort,to defending the people who have committed it against the consequencesof their own wrongdoing.Last August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grewevident that the existing Cuban Government was powerless to quell. ThisGovernment was repeatedly asked by the then Cuban Government tointervene, and finally was notified by the President of Cuba that heintended to resign; that his decision was irrevocable; that none of theother constitutional officers would consent to carry on the Government,and that he was powerless to maintain order. It was evident that chaoswas impending, and there was every probability that if steps were notimmediately taken by this Government to try to restore order therepresentatives of various European nations in the island would applyto their respective governments for armed intervention in order toprotect the lives and property of their citizens. Thanks to thepreparedness of our Navy, I was able immediately to send enough shipsto Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless; and Ifurthermore dispatched to Cuba the Secretary of War and the AssistantSecretary of State, in order that they might grapple with the situationon the ground. All efforts to secure an agreement between thecontending factions, by which they should themselves come to anamicable understanding and settle upon some modus vivendi someprovisional government of their own failed. Finally the President ofthe Republic resigned. The quorum of Congress assembled failed bydeliberate purpose of its members, so that there was no power to act onhis resignation, and the Government came to a halt. In accordance withthe so called Platt amendment, which was embodied in the constitutionof Cuba, I thereupon proclaimed a provisional government for theisland, the Secretary of War acting as provisional governor until hecould be replaced by Mr. Magoon, the late minister to Panama andgovernor of the Canal Zone on the Isthmus; troops were sent to supportthem and to relieve the Navy, the expedition being handled with mostsatisfactory speed and efficiency. The insurgent chiefs immediatelyagreed that their troops should lay down their arms and disband; andthe agreement was carried out. The provisional government has left thepersonnel of the old government and the old laws, so far as might be,unchanged, and will thus administer the island for a few months untiltranquillity can be restored, a new election properly held, and a newgovernment inaugurated. Peace has come in the island; and theharvesting of the sugar cane crop, the great crop of the island, isabout to proceed.When the election has been held and the new government inaugurated inpeaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to anend. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the Americanpeople, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that thepeople of Cuba will realize the imperative need of preserving justiceand keeping order in the Island. The United States wishes nothing ofCuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishesnothing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve orderamong themselves and therefore to preserve their independence. If theelections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomesconfirmed in the Island, it is absolutely out of the question that theIsland should continue independent; and the United States, which hasassumed the sponsorship before the civilized world for Cuba\'s career asa nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the governmentwas managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life andproperty. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self governmentis always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with theCubans as they tread this difficult path. I have the utmost sympathywith, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnlyto weigh their responsibilities and to see that when their newgovernment is started it shall run smoothly, and with freedom fromflagrant denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionarydisturbances on the other.The Second International Conference of American Republics, held inMexico in the years 1901 2, provided for the holding of the thirdconference within five years, and committed the fixing of the time andplace and the arrangements for the conference to the governing board ofthe Bureau of American Republics, composed of the representatives ofall the American nations in Washington. That board discharged the dutyimposed upon it with marked fidelity and painstaking care, and upon thecourteous invitation of the United States of Brazil the conference washeld at Rio de Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of July to the 29th ofAugust last. Many subjects of common interest to all the Americannations were discust by the conference, and the conclusions reached,embodied in a series of resolutions and proposed conventions, will belaid before you upon the coming in of the final report of the Americandelegates. They contain many matters of importance relating to theextension of trade, the increase of communication, the smoothing awayof barriers to free intercourse, and the promotion of a betterknowledge and good understanding between the different countriesrepresented. The meetings of the conference were harmonious and theconclusions were reached with substantial unanimity. It is interestingto observe that in the successive conferences which have been held therepresentatives of the different American nations have been learning towork together effectively, for, while the First Conference inWashington in 1889, and the Second Conference in Mexico in 1901 2,occupied many months, with much time wasted in an unregulated andfruitless discussion, the Third Conference at Rio exhibited much of thefacility in the practical dispatch of business which characterizespermanent deliberative bodies, and completed its labors within theperiod of six weeks originally allotted for its sessions.Quite apart from the specific value of the conclusions reached by theconference, the example of the representatives of all the Americannations engaging in harmonious and kindly consideration and discussionof subjects of common interest is itself of great and substantial valuefor the promotion of reasonable and considerate treatment of allinternational questions. The thanks of this country are due to theGovernment of Brazil and to the people of Rio de Janeiro for thegenerous hospitality with which our delegates, in common with theothers, were received, entertained, and facilitated in their work.Incidentally to the meeting of the conference, the Secretary of Statevisited the city of Rio de Janeiro and was cordially received by theconference, of which he was made an honorary president. Theannouncement of his intention to make this visit was followed by mostcourteous and urgent invitations from nearly all the countries of SouthAmerica to visit them as the guest of their Governments. It was deemedthat by the acceptance of these invitations we might appropriatelyexpress the real respect and friendship in which we hold our sisterRepublics of the southern continent, and the Secretary, accordingly,visited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Colombia.He refrained from visiting Paraguay, Bolivia, and Ecuador only becausethe distance of their capitals from the seaboard made it impracticablewith the time at his disposal. He carried with him a message of peaceand friendship, and of strong desire for good understanding and mutualhelpfulness; and he was everywhere received in the spirit of hismessage. The members of government, the press, the learned professions,the men of business, and the great masses of the people unitedeverywhere in emphatic response to his friendly expressions and indoing honor to the country and cause which he represented.In many parts of South America there has been much misunderstanding ofthe attitude and purposes of the United States towards the otherAmerican Republics. An idea had become prevalent that our assertion ofthe Monroe Doctrine implied, or carried with it, an assumption ofsuperiority, and of a right to exercise some kind of protectorate overthe countries to whose territory that doctrine applies. Nothing couldbe farther from the truth. Yet that impression continued to be aserious barrier to good understanding, to friendly intercourse, to theintroduction of American capital and the extension of American trade.The impression was so widespread that apparently it could not bereached by any ordinary means.It was part of Secretary Root\'s mission to dispel this unfoundedimpression, and there is just cause to believe that he has succeeded.In an address to the Third Conference at Rio on the 31st of July anaddress of such note that I send it in, together with this message hesaid:"We wish for no victories but those of peace; for no territory exceptour own; for no sovereignty except the sovereignty over ourselves. Wedeem the independence and equal rights of the smallest and weakestmember of the family of nations entitled to as much respect as those ofthe greatest empire, and we deem the observance of that respect thechief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of the strong. Weneither claim nor desire any rights or privileges or powers that we donot freely concede to every American Republic. We wish to increase ourprosperity, to extend our trade, to grow in wealth, in wisdom, and inspirit, but our conception of the true way to accomplish this is not topull down others and profit by their ruin, but to help all friends to acommon prosperity and a common growth, that we may all become greaterand stronger together. Within a few months for the first time therecognized possessors of every foot of soil upon the Americancontinents can be and I hope will be represented with the acknowledgedrights of equal sovereign states in the great World Congress at TheHague. This will be the world\'s formal and final acceptance of thedeclaration that no part of the American continents is to be deemedsubject to colonization. Let us pledge ourselves to aid each other inthe full performance of the duty to humanity which that accepteddeclaration implies, so that in time the weakest and most unfortunateof our Republics may come to march with equal step by the side of thestronger and more fortunate. Let us help each other to show that forall the races of men the liberty for which we have fought and laboredis the twin sister of justice and peace. Let us unite in creating andmaintaining and making effective an all American public opinion, whosepower shall influence international conduct and prevent internationalwrong, and narrow the causes of war, and forever preserve our freelands from the burden of such armaments as are massed behind thefrontiers of Europe, and bring us ever nearer to the perfection ofordered liberty. So shall come security and prosperity, production andtrade, wealth, learning, the arts, and happiness for us all."These words appear to have been received with acclaim in every part ofSouth America. They have my hearty approval, as I am sure they willhave yours, and I can not be wrong in the conviction that theycorrectly represent the sentiments of the whole American people. I cannot better characterize the true attitude of the United States in itsassertion of the Monroe Doctrine than in the words of the distinguishedformer minister of foreign affairs of Argentina, Doctor Drago, in hisspeech welcoming Mr. Root at Buenos Ayres. He spoke of "The traditional policy of the United States (which) withoutaccentuating superiority or seeking preponderance, condemned theoppression of the nations of this part of the world and the control oftheir destinies by the great Powers of Europe."It is gratifying to know that in the great city of Buenos Ayres, uponthe arches which spanned the streets, entwined with Argentine andAmerican flags for the reception of our representative, there wereemblazoned not\' only the names of Washington and Jefferson andMarshall, but also, in appreciative recognition of their services tothe cause of South American independence, the names of James Monroe,John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Richard Rush. We take especialpleasure in the graceful courtesy of the Government of Brazil, which has given to the beautiful and stately building first used for themeeting of the conference the name of "Palacio Monroe." Our gratefulacknowledgments are due to the Governments and the people of all thecountries visited by the Secretary of State for the courtesy, thefriendship, and the honor shown to our country in their generoushospitality to him.In my message to you on the 5th of December, 1905, I called yourattention to the embarrassment that might be caused to this Governmentby the assertion by foreign nations of the right to collect by force ofarms contract debts due by American republics to citizens of thecollecting nation, and to the danger that the process of compulsorycollection might result in the occupation of territory tending tobecome permanent. I then said:"Our own Government has always refused to enforce such contractualobligations on behalf of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is muchto be wisht that all foreign governments would take the same view."This subject was one of the topics of consideration at the conferenceat Rio and a resolution was adopted by that conference recommending tothe respective governments represented "to consider the advisability ofasking the Second Peace Conference at The Hague to examine the questionof the compulsory collection of public debts, and, in general, meanstending to diminish among nations conflicts of purely pecuniaryorigin."This resolution was supported by the representatives of the UnitedStates in accordance with the following instructions:"It has long been the established policy of the United States not touse its armed forces for the collection of ordinary contract debts dueto its citizens by other governments. We have not considered the use offorce for such a purpose consistent with that respect for theindependent sovereignty of other members of the family of nations whichis the most important principle of international law and the chiefprotection of weak nations against the oppression of the strong. Itseems to us that the practise is injurious in its general effect uponthe relations of nations and upon the welfare of weak and disorderedstates, whose development ought to be encouraged in the interests ofcivilization; that it offers frequent temptation to bullying andoppression and to unnecessary and unjustifiable warfare. We regret thatother powers, whose opinions and sense of justice we esteem highly,have at times taken a different view and have permitted themselves,though we believe with reluctance, to collect such debts by force. Itis doubtless true that the non payment of public debts may beaccompanied by such circumstances of fraud and wrongdoing or violationof treaties as to justify the use of force. This Government would beglad to see an international consideration of the subject which shalldiscriminate between such cases and the simple nonperformance of acontract with a private person, and a resolution in favor of relianceupon peaceful means in cases of the latter class."It is not felt, however, that the conference at Rio should undertaketo make such a discrimination or to resolve upon such a rule. Most ofthe American countries are still debtor nations, while the countries ofEurope are the creditors. If the Rio conference, therefore, were totake such action it would have the appearance of a meeting of debtorsresolving how their creditors should act, and this would not inspirerespect. The true course is indicated by the terms of the program,which proposes to request the Second Hague Conference, where bothcreditors and debtors will be assembled, to consider the subject."Last June trouble which had existed for some time between the Republicsof Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras culminated in war a war whichthreatened to be ruinous to the countries involved and very destructiveto the commercial interests of Americans, Mexicans, and otherforeigners who are taking an important part in the development of thesecountries. The thoroughly good understanding which exists between theUnited States and Mexico enabled this Government and that of Mexico tounite in effective mediation between the warring Republics; whichmediation resulted, not without long continued and patient effort, inbringing about a meeting of the representatives of the hostile powerson board a United States warship as neutral territory, and peace wasthere concluded; a peace which resulted in the saving of thousands oflives and in the prevention of an incalculable amount of misery and thedestruction of property and of the means of livelihood. The RioConference past the following resolution in reference to this action:"That the Third International American Conference shall address to thePresidents of the United States of America and of the United States ofMexico a note in which the conference which is being held at Rioexpresses its satisfaction at the happy results of their mediation forthe celebration of peace between the Republics of Guatemala, Honduras,and Salvador."This affords an excellent example of one way in which the influence ofthe United States can properly be exercised for the benefit of thepeoples of the Western Hemisphere; that is, by action taken in concertwith other American republics and therefore free from those suspicionsand prejudices which might attach if the action were taken by onealone. In this way it is possible to exercise a powerful influencetoward the substitution of considerate action in the spirit of justicefor the insurrectionary or international violence which has hithertobeen so great a hindrance to the development of many of our neighbors.Repeated examples of united action by several or many Americanrepublics in favor of peace, by urging cool and reasonable, instead ofexcited and belligerent, treatment of international controversies, cannot fail to promote the growth of a general public opinion among theAmerican nations which will elevate the standards of internationalaction, strengthen the sense of international duty among governments,and tell in favor of the peace of mankind.I have just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you atlength later on the whole subject of the Panama Canal.The Algeciras Convention, which was signed by the United States as wellas by most of the powers of Europe, supersedes the previous conventionof 1880, which was also signed both by the United States and a majorityof the European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercialrights with all European countries and does not entail a singleobligation of any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedilyratified. To refuse to ratify it would merely mean that we forfeitedour commercial rights in Morocco and would not achieve another objectof any kind. In the event of such refusal we would be left for thefirst time in a hundred and twenty years without any commercial treatywith Morocco; and this at a time when we are everywhere seeking newmarkets and outlets for trade.The destruction of the Pribilof Islands fur seals by pelagic sealingstill continues. The herd which, according to the surveys made in 1874by direction of the Congress, numbered 4,700,000, and which, accordingto the survey of both American and Canadian commissioners in 1891,amounted to 1,000,000, has now been reduced to about 180,000. Thisresult has been brought about by Canadian and some other sealingvessels killing the female seals while in the water during their annualpilgrimage to and from the south, or in search of food. As a rule thefemale seal when killed is pregnant, and also has an unweaned pup onland, so that, for each skin taken by pelagic sealing, as a rule, threelives are destroyed the mother, the unborn offspring, and the nursingpup, which is left to starve to death. No damage whatever is done tothe herd by the carefully regulated killing on land; the custom ofpelagic sealing is solely responsible for all of the present evil, andis alike indefensible from the economic standpoint and from thestandpoint of humanity.In 1896 over 16,000 young seals were found dead from starvation on thePribilof Islands. In 1897 it was estimated that since pelagic sealingbegan upward of 400,000 adult female seals had been killed at sea, andover 300,000 young seals had died of starvation as the result. Therevolting barbarity of such a practise, as well as the wastefuldestruction which it involves, needs no demonstration and is its owncondemnation. The Bering Sea Tribunal, which sat in Paris in 1893, andwhich decided against the claims of the United States to exclusivejurisdiction in the waters of Bering Sea and to a property right in thefur seals when outside of the three mile limit, determined also uponcertain regulations which the Tribunal considered sufficient for theproper protection and preservation of the fur seal in, or habituallyresorting to, the Bering Sea. The Tribunal by its regulationsestablished a close season, from the 1st of May to the 31st of July,and excluded all killing in the waters within 60 miles around thePribilof Islands. They also provided that the regulations which theyhad determined upon, with a view to the protection and preservation ofthe seals, should be submitted every five years to new examination, soas to enable both interested Governments to consider whether, in thelight of past experience, there was occasion for any modificationthereof.The regulations have proved plainly inadequate to accomplish the objectof protection and preservation of the fur seals, and for a long timethis Government has been trying in vain to secure from Great Britainsuch revision and modification of the regulations as were contemplatedand provided for by the award of the Tribunal of Paris.The process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years bythe appearance of a number of Japanese vessels engaged in pelagicsealing. As these vessels have not been bound even by the inadequatelimitations prescribed by the Tribunal of Paris, they have paid noattention either to the close season or to the sixty mile limit imposedupon the Canadians, and have prosecuted their work up to the veryislands themselves. On July 16 and 17 the crews from several Japanesevessels made raids upon the island of St. Paul, and before they werebeaten off by the very meager and insufficiently armed guard, theysucceeded in killing several hundred seals and carrying off the skinsof most of them. Nearly all the seals killed were females and the workwas done with frightful barbarity. Many of the seals appear to havebeen skinned alive and many were found half skinned and still alive.The raids were repelled only by the use of firearms, and five of theraiders were killed, two were wounded, and twelve captured, includingthe two wounded. Those captured have since been tried and sentenced toimprisonment. An attack of this kind had been wholly unlookt for, butsuch provision of vessels, arms, and ammunition will now be made thatits repetition will not be found profitable.Suitable representations regarding the incident have been made to theGovernment of Japan, and we are assured that all practicable measureswill be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage.On our part, the guard on the island will be increased and betterequipped and organized, and a better revenue cutter patrol serviceabout the islands will be established; next season a United States warvessel will also be sent there.We have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with GreatBritain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations withJapan for the same purpose are in progress.The laws for the protection of the seals within the jurisdiction of theUnited States need revision and amendment. Only the islands of St. Pauland St. George are now, in terms, included in the Governmentreservation, and the other islands are also to be included. The landingof aliens as well as citizens upon the islands, without a permit fromthe Department of Commerce and Labor, for any purpose except in case ofstress of weather or for water, should be prohibited under adequatepenalties. The approach of vessels for the excepted purposes should beregulated. The authority of the Government agents on the islands shouldbe enlarged, and the chief agent should have the powers of a committingmagistrate. The entrance of a vessel into the territorial waterssurrounding the islands with intent to take seals should be made acriminal offense and cause of forfeiture. Authority for seizures insuch cases should be given and the presence on any such vessel of sealsor sealskins, or the paraphernalia for taking them, should be madeprima facie evidence of such intent. I recommend what legislation isneeded to accomplish these ends; and I commend to your attention thereport of Mr. Sims, of the Department of Commerce and Labor, on thissubject.In case we are compelled to abandon the hope of making arrangementswith other governments to put an end to the hideous cruelty nowincident to pelagic sealing, it will be a question for your seriousconsideration how far we should continue to protect and maintain theseal herd on land with the result of continuing such a practise, andwhether it is not better to end the practice by exterminating the herdourselves in the most humane way possible.In my last message I advised you that the Emperor of Russia had takenthe initiative in bringing about a second peace conference at TheHague. Under the guidance of Russia the arrangement of thepreliminaries for such a conference has been progressing during thepast year. Progress has necessarily been slow, owing to the greatnumber of countries to be consulted upon every question that hasarisen. It is a matter of satisfaction that all of the AmericanRepublics have now, for the first time, been invited to join in theproposed conference.The close connection between the subjects to be taken up by the RedCross Conference held at Geneva last summer and the subjects whichnaturally would come before The Hague Conference made it apparent thatit was desirable to have the work of the Red Cross Conference completedand considered by the different powers before the meeting at The Hague.The Red Cross Conference ended its labors on the 6th day of July, andthe revised and amended convention, which was signed by the Americandelegates, will be promptly laid before the Senate.By the special and highly appreciated courtesy of the Governments ofRussia and the Netherlands, a proposal to call The Hague Conferencetogether at a time which would conflict with the Conference of theAmerican Republics at Rio de Janeiro in August was laid aside. No otherdate has yet been suggested. A tentative program for the conference hasbeen proposed by the Government of Russia, and the subjects which itenumerates are undergoing careful examination and consideration inpreparation for the conference.It must ever be kept in mind that war is not merely justifiable, butimperative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peacecan only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or ofnational welfare. Peace is normally a great good, and normally itcoincides with righteousness; but it is righteousness and not peacewhich should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind theconscience of an individual; and neither a nation nor an individual cansurrender conscience to another\'s keeping. Neither can a nation, whichis an entity, and which does not die as individuals die, refrain fromtaking thought for the interest of the generations that are to come, noless than for the interest of the generation of to day; and no publicmen have a right, whether from shortsightedness, from selfishindifference, or from sentimentality, to sacrifice national interestswhich are vital in character. A just war is in the long run far betterfor a nation\'s soul than the most prosperous peace obtained byacquiescence in wrong or injustice. Moreover, though it is criminal fora nation not to prepare for war, so that it may escape the dreadfulconsequences of being defeated in war, yet it must always be rememberedthat even to be defeated in war may be far better than not to havefought at all. As has been well and finely said, a beaten nation is notnecessarily a disgraced nation; but the nation or man is disgraced ifthe obligation to defend right is shirked.We should as a nation do everything in our power for the cause ofhonorable peace. It is morally as indefensible for a nation to commit awrong upon another nation, strong or weak, as for an individual thus towrong his fellows. We should do all in our power to hasten the day whenthere shall be peace among the nations a peace based upon justice andnot upon cowardly submission to wrong. We can accomplish a good deal inthis direction, but we can not accomplish everything, and the penaltyof attempting to do too much would almost inevitably be to do worsethan nothing; for it must be remembered that fantastic extremists arenot in reality leaders of the causes which they espouse, but areordinarily those who do most to hamper the real leaders of the causeand to damage the cause itself. As yet there is no likelihood ofestablishing any kind of international power, of whatever sort, whichcan effectively check wrongdoing, and in these circumstances it wouldbe both a foolish and an evil thing for a great and free nation todeprive itself of the power to protect its own rights and even inexceptional cases to stand up for the rights of others. Nothing wouldmore promote iniquity, nothing would further defer the reign upon earthof peace and righteousness, than for the free and enlightened peopleswhich, though with much stumbling and many shortcomings, neverthelessstrive toward justice, deliberately to render themselves powerlesswhile leaving every despotism and barbarism armed and able to worktheir wicked will. The chance for the settlement of disputespeacefully, by arbitration, now depends mainly upon the possession bythe nations that mean to do right of sufficient armed strength to maketheir purpose effective.The United States Navy is the surest guarantor of peace which thiscountry possesses. It is earnestly to be wisht that we would profit bythe teachings of history in this matter. A strong and wise people willstudy its own failures no less than its triumphs, for there is wisdomto be learned from the study of both, of the mistake as well as of thesuccess. For this purpose nothing could be more instructive than arational study of the war of 1812, as it is told, for instance, byCaptain Mahan. There was only one way in which that war could have beenavoided. If during the preceding twelve years a navy relatively asstrong as that which this country now has had been built up, and anarmy provided relatively as good as that which the country now has,there never would have been the slightest necessity of fighting thewar; and if the necessity had arisen the war would under suchcircumstances have ended with our speedy and overwhelming triumph. Butour people during those twelve years refused to make any preparationswhatever, regarding either the Army or the Navy. They saved a millionor two of dollars by so doing; and in mere money paid a hundredfold foreach million they thus saved during the three years of war whichfollowed a war which brought untold suffering upon our people, whichat one time threatened the gravest national disaster, and which, inspite of the necessity of waging it, resulted merely in what was ineffect a drawn battle, while the balance of defeat and triumph wasalmost even.I do not ask that we continue to increase our Navy. I ask merely thatit be maintained at its present strength; and this can be done only ifwe replace the obsolete and outworn ships by new and good ones, theequals of any afloat in any navy. To stop building ships for one yearmeans that for that year the Navy goes back instead of forward. The oldbattle ship Texas, for instance, would now be of little service in astand up fight with a powerful adversary. The old double turretmonitors have outworn their usefulness, while it was a waste of moneyto build the modern single turret monitors. All these ships should bereplaced by others; and this can be done by a well settled program ofproviding for the building each year of at least one first class battleship equal in size and speed to any that any nation is at the same timebuilding; the armament presumably to consist of as large a number aspossible of very heavy guns of one caliber, together with smaller gunsto repel torpedo attack; while there should be heavy armor, turbineengines, and in short, every modern device. Of course, from time totime, cruisers, colliers, torpedo boat destroyers or torpedo boats,Will have to be built also. All this, be it remembered, would notincrease our Navy, but would merely keep it at its present strength.Equally of course, the ships will be absolutely useless if the menaboard them are not so trained that they can get the best possibleservice out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechanismsintrusted to their care. The marksmanship of our men has so improvedduring the last five years that I deem it within bounds to say that theNavy is more than twice as efficient, ship for ship, as half a decadeago. The Navy can only attain proper efficiency if enough officers andmen are provided, and if these officers and men are given the chance(and required to take advantage of it) to stay continually at sea andto exercise the fleets singly and above all in squadron, the exerciseto be of every kind and to include unceasing practise at the guns,conducted under conditions that will test marksmanship in time of war.In both the Army and the Navy there is urgent need that everythingpossible should be done to maintain the highest standard for thepersonnel, alike as regards the officers and the enlisted men. I do notbelieve that in any service there is a finer body of enlisted men andof junior officer than we have in both the Army and the Navy, includingthe Marine Corps. All possible encouragement to the enlisted men shouldbe given, in pay and otherwise, and everything practicable done torender the service attractive to men of the right type. They should beheld to the strictest discharge of their duty, and in them a spiritshould be encouraged which demands not the mere performance of duty,but the performance of far more than duty, if it conduces to the honorand the interest of the American nation; and in return the amplestconsideration should be theirs.West Point and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do notneed to have these schools made more scholastic. On the contrary weshould never lose sight of the fact that the aim of each school is toturn out a man who shall be above everything else a fighting man. Inthe Army in particular it is not necessary that either the cavalry orinfantry officer should have special mathematical ability. Probably inboth schools the best part of the education is the high standard ofcharacter and of professional morale which it confers.But in both services there is urgent need for the establishment of aprinciple of selection which will eliminate men after a certain age ifthey can not be promoted from the subordinate ranks, and which willbring into the higher ranks fewer men, and these at an earlier age.This principle of selection will be objected to by good men of mediocrecapacity, who are fitted to do well while young in the lower positions,but who are not fitted to do well when at an advanced age they comeinto positions of command and of great responsibility. But the desireof these men to be promoted to positions which they are not competentto fill should not weigh against the interest of the Navy and thecountry. At present our men, especially in the Navy, are kept far toolong in the junior grades, and then, at much too advanced an age, areput quickly through the senior grades, often not attaining to thesesenior grades until they are too old to be of real use in them; and ifthey are of real use, being put through them so quickly that littlebenefit to the Navy comes from their having been in them at all.The Navy has one great advantage over the Army in the fact that theofficers of high rank are actually trained in the continual performanceof their duties; that is, in the management of the battle ships andarmored cruisers gathered into fleets. This is not true of the armyofficers, who rarely have corresponding chances to exercise commandover troops under service conditions. The conduct of the Spanish warshowed the lamentable loss of life, the useless extravagance, and theinefficiency certain to result, if during peace the high officials ofthe War and Navy Departments are praised and rewarded only if they savemoney at no matter what cost to the efficiency of the service, and ifthe higher officers are given no chance whatever to exercise andpractise command. For years prior to the Spanish war the Secretaries ofWar were praised chiefly if they practised economy; which economy,especially in connection with the quartermaster, commissary, andmedical departments, was directly responsible for most of themismanagement that occurred in the war itself and parenthetically beit observed that the very people who clamored for the misdirectedeconomy in the first place were foremost to denounce the mismanagement,loss, and suffering which were primarily due to this same misdirectedeconomy and to the lack of preparation it involved. There should soonbe an increase in the number of men for our coast defenses; these menshould be of the right type and properly trained; and there shouldtherefore be an increase of pay for certain skilled grades, especiallyin the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troopsto be massed in body and exercised in maneuvers, particularly inmarching. Such exercise during the summer just past has been ofincalculable benefit to the Army and should under no circumstances bediscontinued. If on these practise marches and in these maneuverselderly officers prove unable to bear the strain, they should beretired at once, for the fact is conclusive as to their unfitness forwar; that is, for the only purpose because of which they should beallowed to stay in the service. It is a real misfortune to have scoresof small company or regimental posts scattered throughout the country;the Army should be gathered in a few brigade or division posts; and thegenerals should be practised in handling the men in masses. Neglect toprovide for all of this means to incur the risk of future disaster anddisgrace.The readiness and efficiency of both the Army and Navy in dealing withthe recent sudden crisis in Cuba illustrate afresh their value to theNation. This readiness and efficiency would have been very much lesshad it not been for the existence of the General Staff in the Army andthe General Board in the Navy; both are essential to the properdevelopment and use of our military forces afloat and ashore. Thetroops that were sent to Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was theswiftest mobilization and dispatch of troops over sea ever accomplishedby our Government. The expedition landed completely equipped and readyfor immediate service, several of its organizations hardly remaining inHavana over night before splitting up into detachments and going totheir several posts, It was a fine demonstration of the value andefficiency of the General Staff. Similarly, it was owing in large partto the General Board that the Navy was able at the outset to meet theCuban crisis with such instant efficiency; ship after ship appearing onthe shortest notice at any threatened point, while the Marine Corps inparticular performed indispensable service. The Army and Navy WarColleges are of incalculable value to the two services, and theycooperate with constantly increasing efficiency and importance.The Congress has most wisely provided for a National Board for thepromotion of rifle practise. Excellent results have already come fromthis law, but it does not go far enough. Our Regular Army is so smallthat in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers; andin such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot; for ifa soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of himself inthe open, his efficiency on the line of battle is almost directlyProportionate to excellence in marksmanship. We should establishshooting galleries in all the large public and military schools, shouldmaintain national target ranges in different parts of the country, andshould in every way encourage the formation of rifle clubs throughoutall parts of the land. The little Republic of Switzerland offers us anexcellent example in all matters connected with building up anefficient citizen soldiery.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:No nation has greater resources than ours, and I think it can betruthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energyand industrial ability. In no nation are the fundamental businessconditions sounder than in ours at this very moment; and it is foolish,when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping itin sound banks; for it is such hoarding that is the immediate occasionof money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people isconducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms andfactories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercialenterprises.In any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who aredishonest, and if the conditions are such that these men prosper orcommit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thingfor the community. Where these men are business men of great sagacityand of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where theconditions are such that they act without supervision or control and atfirst without effective check from public opinion, they delude manyinnocent people into making investments or embarking in kinds ofbusiness that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of thesesuccessfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering comes not onlyupon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is apainful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it doesoccur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it wasdeferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish theguilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible tominimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yetit is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving toput an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of thesuffering, and, as a means to this end, where possible to punish thoseresponsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as tomany governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differencesas to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war againstsuccessful dishonesty.In my Message to the Congress on December 5, 1905, I said:"If the folly of man mars the general well being, then those who areinnocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred bythose who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by thespeculative folly of part of the business community would hurt thewhole business community; but such stoppage of welfare, though it mightbe severe, would not be lasting. In the long run, the one vital factorin the permanent prosperity of the country is the high individualcharacter of the average American worker, the average American citizen,no matter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he be farmer orwage worker, business man or professional man."In our industrial and social system the interests of all men are soclosely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases astraight dealing man, who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity andindustry, benefits himself, must also benefit others. Normally, the manof great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor ofmany other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they couldproduce without his guidance; and both he and they share in thebenefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial factthat the sharing may be unequal must never blind us to the underlyingfact that there is this sharing, and that the benefit comes in somedegree to each man concerned.. Normally, the wageworker, the man ofsmall means, and the average consumer, as well as the average producer,are all alike helped by making conditions such that the man ofexceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for hisability Something can be done by legislation to help the generalprosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character canbe given to the less able and less fortunate save as the results of apolicy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious andefficient people who act decently; and this is only another way ofsaying that any benefit which comes to the less able and less fortunatemust of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate.If, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his morefortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they haveboth, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be thatwhile damage may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an evenheavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole, we mustall go up or go down together."Yet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is alsotrue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision someof the exceptional men use their energies, not in ways that are for thecommon good, but in ways which tell against this common good. Thefortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, andvest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter ofnecessity to give to the sovereign that is, to the Government, whichrepresents the people as a whole some effective power of supervisionover their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy social andindustrial life, every big corporation should be held responsible by,and be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control itsconduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age ofcombination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not onlyuseless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law whichthe failure to enforce law inevitably produces. We should, moreover,recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected bycorporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth ofintellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and thereforenormally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors.The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come tostay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored solong as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it actsagainst law and justice."The makers of our National Constitution provided especially that theregulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of theGeneral Government. The arguments in favor of their taking this standwere even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to day, in viewof the enormous development of great business agencies, usuallycorporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is uselessto try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these greatcorporations by State action. Such regulation and supervision can onlybe effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction iscoextensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by theNational Government. I believe that this regulation and supervision canbe obtained by the enactment of law by the Congress. Our steady aimshould be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, butresolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the NationalGovernment by affirmative action."This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely arestoration; for from the earliest time such regulation of industrialactivities has been recognized in the action of the lawmaking bodies;and all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manneras will prevent the Commonwealth abdicating the power it has alwayspossessed, not only in this country, but also in England before andsince this country became a separate nation."It has been a misfortune that the National laws on this subject havehitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmativekind, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit whatcould not be effectively prohibited, and have in part in theirprohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not beallowed. It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint oncompetition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; andwhere it is not useless it is generally hurtful. The successfulprosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops anotherdevice to accomplish the same purpose. What is needed is not sweepingprohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend torestrict competition, but such adequate supervision and regulation aswill prevent any restriction of competition from being to the detrimentof the public, as well as such supervision and regulation as willprevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction ofcompetition."I have called your attention in these quotations to what I have alreadysaid because I am satisfied that it is the duty of the NationalGovernment to embody in action the principles thus expressed.No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to anextreme the national virtue of self reliance, of independence ininitiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and toprovide for its fullest exercise, compatible with seeing that libertydoes not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is thekind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitablybreeds. The founders of the Constitution provided that the NationalGovernment should have complete and sole control of interstatecommerce. There was then practically no interstate business save suchas was conducted by water, and this the National Government at onceproceeded to regulate in thoroughgoing and effective fashion.Conditions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce bywater is insignificant compared with the amount that goes by land, andalmost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstatecommerce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectlycontrolled or regulated by the action of any one of the several States;such action inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else toolax, and in either case ineffective for purposes of justice. Only theNational Government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the neededcontrol. This does not mean that there should be any extension ofFederal authority, for such authority already exists under theConstitution in amplest and most far reaching form; but it does meanthat there should be an extension of Federal activity. This is notadvocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face, andrealizing that centralization in business has already come and can notbe avoided or undone, and that the public at large can only protectitself from certain evil effects of this business centralization byproviding better methods for the exercise of control through theauthority already centralized in the National Government by theConstitution itself. There must be no ball in the healthy constructivecourse of action which this Nation has elected to pursue, and hassteadily pursued, during the last six years, as shown both in thelegislation of the Congress and the administration of the law by theDepartment of Justice. The most vital need is in connection with therailroads. As to these, in my judgment there should now be either anational incorporation act or a law licensing railway companies toengage in interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The law shouldbe so framed as to give to the Interstate Commerce Commission power topass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should beprovided to enable the Commission, whenever in its judgment it isnecessary, to make a physical valuation of any railroad. As I stated inmy Message to the Congress a year ago, railroads should be given powerto enter into agreements, subject to these agreements being made publicin minute detail and to the consent of the Interstate CommerceCommission being first obtained. Until the National Government assumesproper control of interstate commerce, in the exercise of the authorityit already possesses, it will be impossible either to give to or to getfrom the railroads full justice. The railroads and all other greatcorporations will do well to recognize that this control must come; theonly question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exerciseit. The courts will determine the limits within which the Federalauthority can exercise it, and there will still remain ample workwithin each State for the railway commission of that State; and theNational Interstate Commerce Commission will work in harmony with theseveral State commissions, each within its own province, to achieve thedesired end.Moreover, in my judgment there should be additional legislation lookingto the proper control of the great business concerns engaged ininterstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefitand prosperity no less than for the protection of investors and of thegeneral public. As I have repeatedly said in Messages to the Congressand elsewhere, experience has definitely shown not merely the unwisdombut the futility of endeavoring to put a stop to all businesscombinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that combination isnot only necessary but inevitable. It is so in the world of businessjust as it is so in the world of labor, and it is as idle to desire toput an end to all corporations, to all big combinations of capital, asto desire to put an end to combinations of labor. Corporation and laborunion alike have come to stay. Each if properly managed is a source ofgood and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it should bepromptly held to account; but it should receive hearty encouragement solong as it is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to put or keepon the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of publicmorality that really puts a premium upon public immorality, byundertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done undermodern business conditions, so that the law itself provides that itsown infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success.To aim at the accomplishment of too much usually means theaccomplishment of too little, and often the doing of positive damage.In my Message to the Congress a year ago, in speaking of the antitrustlaws, I said:"The actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to prohibitall combination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective.Combination of capital, like combination of labor, is a necessaryelement in our present industrial system. It is not possible completelyto prevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention woulddo damage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try toprevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequatecontrol and supervision of the combinations as to prevent theirinjuring the public, or existing in such forms as inevitably tothreaten injury. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbidall combinations instead of sharply discriminating between thosecombinations which do evil. Often railroads would like to combine forthe purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining improperadvantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public.Such a combination, instead of being forbidden by law, should befavored. It is a public evil to have on the statute books a lawincapable of full enforcement, because both judges and juries realizethat its full enforcement would destroy the business of the country;for the result is to make decent men violators of the law against theirwill, and to put a premium on the behavior of the willful wrongdoers.Such a result in turn tends to throw the decent man and the willfulwrongdoer into close association, and in the end to drag down theformer to the latter\'s level; for the man who becomes a lawbreaker inone way unhappily tends to lose all respect for law and to be willingto break it in many ways. No more scathing condemnation could bevisited upon a law than is contained in the words of the InterstateCommerce Commission when, in commenting upon the fact that the numerousjoint traffic associations do technically violate the law, they say:The decision of the United States Supreme Court in the Trans Missouricase and the Joint Traffic Association case has produced no practicaleffect upon the railway operations of the country. Such associations,in fact, exist now as they did before these decisions, and with thesame general effect. In justice to all parties, we ought probably toadd that it is difficult to see how our interstate railways could beoperated with due regard to the interest of the shipper and the railwaywithout concerted action of the kind afforded through theseassociations."This means that the law as construed by the Supreme Court is such thatthe business of the country can not be conducted without breaking it."As I have elsewhere said:"All this is substantially what I have said over and over again. Surelyit ought not to be necessary to say that it in no shape or wayrepresents any hostility to corporations as such. On the contrary, itmeans a frank recognition of the fact that combinations of capital,like combinations of labor, are a natural result of modern conditionsand of our National development. As far as in my ability lies myendeavor is and will be to prevent abuse of power by either and tofavor both so long as they do well. The aim of the National Governmentis quite as much to favor and protect honest corporations, honestbusiness men of wealth, as to bring to justice those individuals andcorporations representing dishonest methods. Most certainly there willbe no relaxation by the Government authorities in the effort to get atany great railroad wrecker any man who by clever swindling devicesrobs investors, oppresses wage workers, and does injustice to thegeneral public. But any such move as this is in the interest of honestrailway operators, of honest corporations, and of those who, when theyinvest their small savings in stocks and bonds, wish to be assured thatthese will represent money honestly expended for legitimate businesspurposes. To confer upon the National Government the power for which Iask would be a check upon overcapitalization and upon the clevergamblers who benefit by overcapitalization. But it alone would mean anincrease in the value, an increase in the safety of the stocks andbonds of law abiding, honestly managed railroads, and would render itfar easier to market their securities. I believe in proper publicity.There has been complaint of some of the investigations recently carriedon, but those who complain should put the blame where it belongs uponthe misdeeds which are done in darkness and not upon the investigationswhich brought them to light. The Administration is responsible forturning on the light, but it is not responsible for what the lightshowed. I ask for full power to be given the Federal Government,because no single State can by legislation effectually cope with thesepowerful corporations engaged in interstate commerce, and, while doingthem full justice, exact from them in return full justice to others.The conditions of railroad activity, the conditions of our immenseinterstate commerce, are such as to make the Central Government alonecompetent to exercise full supervision and control."The grave abuses in individual cases of railroad management in thepast represent wrongs not merely to the general public, but, above all,wrongs to fair dealing and honest corporations and men of wealth,because they excite a popular anger and distrust which from the verynature of the case tends to include in the sweep of its resentment goodand bad alike. From the standpoint of the public I can not tooearnestly say that as soon as the natural and proper resentment arousedby these abuses becomes indiscriminate and unthinking, it also becomesnot merely unwise and unfair, but calculated to defeat the very endswhich those feeling it have in view. There has been plenty of dishonestwork by corporations in the past. There will not be the slightestlet up in the effort to hunt down and punish every dishonest man. Butthe bulk of our business is honestly done. In the natural indignationthe people feel over the dishonesty, it is essential that they shouldnot lose their heads and get drawn into an indiscriminate raid upon allcorporations, all people of wealth, whether they do well or ill. Out ofany such wild movement good will not come, can not come, and never hascome. On the contrary, the surest way to invite reaction is to followthe lead of either demagogue or visionary in a sweeping assault uponproperty values and upon public confidence, which would workincalculable damage in the business world and would produce suchdistrust of the agitators that in the revulsion the distrust wouldextend to honest men who, in sincere and same fashion, are trying toremedy the evils."The antitrust law should not be repealed; but it should be made bothmore efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should beso amended as to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm tothe general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be anincident of, a grant of supervisory power to the Government over thesebig concerns engaged in interstate business. This should be accompaniedby provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and thesubjection of books and papers to the inspection of the Governmentofficials. A beginning has already been made for such supervision bythe establishment of the Bureau of Corporations.The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injusticeto the public, still less those the existence of which is on the wholeof benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law wereabolished, there would remain as an equally objectionable feature thedifficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement. The Governmentmust now submit to irksome and repeated delay before obtaining a finaldecision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even afavorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt tocontrol these corporations by lawsuits means to impose upon both theDepartment of Justice and the courts an impossible burden; it is notfeasible to carry on more than a limited number of such suits. Such alaw to be really effective must of course be administered by anexecutive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design shouldbe to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy andimproper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existenceand then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings.A combination should not be tolerated if it abuse the power acquired bycombination to the public detriment. No corporation or association ofany kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstatecommerce that is formed for the purpose of, or whose operations create,a monopoly or general control of the production, sale, or distributionof any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles ofgeneral use and necessity. Such combinations are against public policy;they violate the common law; the doors of the courts are closed tothose who are parties to them, and I believe the Congress can close thechannels of interstate commerce against them for its protection. Thelaw should make its prohibitions and permissions as clear and definiteas possible, leaving the least possible room for arbitrary action, orallegation of such action, on the part of the Executive, or ofdivergent interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be aimedat should be the prohibition of unhealthy competition, such as byrendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing outcompetition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and theprohibition of a corporation\'s making exclusive trade with itself acondition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agreementsbetween, or combinations of, corporations should be permitted, providedthey are submitted to and approved by some appropriate Government body.The Congress has the power to charter corporations to engage ininterstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted underthe provisions of which existing corporations could take out Federalcharters and new Federal corporations could be created. An essentialprovision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by someFederal board or commission whether the applicant for a Federal charterwas an association or combination within the restrictions of theFederal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity inall matters affecting the public and complete protection to theinvesting public and the shareholders in the matter of issuingcorporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable,a license act for big interstate corporations might be enacted; or acombination of the two might be tried. The supervision establishedmight be analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At least,the antitrust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions ofthe methods which experience has shown have been of most service inenabling monopolistic combinations to crush out competition. The realowners of a corporation should be compelled to do business in their ownname. The right to hold stock in other corporations should hereafter bedenied to interstate corporations, unless on approval by the Governmentofficials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listingwith the Government of all owners and stockholders, both by thecorporation owning such stock and by the corporation in which suchstock is owned.To confer upon the National Government, in connection with theamendment I advocate in the antitrust law, power of supervision overbig business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefitthem as it has benefited the national banks. In the recent businesscrisis it is noteworthy that the institutions which failed wereinstitutions which were not under the supervision and control of theNational Government. Those which were under National control stood thetest.National control of the kind above advocated would be to the benefit ofevery well managed railway. From the standpoint of the public there isneed for additional tracks, additional terminals, and improvements inthe actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly aspossible. Ample, safe, and speedy transportation facilities are evenmore necessary than cheap transportation. Therefore, there is need forthe investment of money which will provide for all these things whileat the same time securing as far as is possible better wages andshorter hours for their employees. Therefore, while there must be justand reasonable regulation of rates, we should be the first to protestagainst any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down withoutthe fullest and most careful consideration of all interests concernedand of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of menacting for the National Government under authority conferred upon it bythe Congress is competent to pass judgment on such a matter.Those who fear, from any reason, the extension of Federal activity willdo well to study the history not only of the national banking act butof the pure food law, and notably the meat inspection law recentlyenacted. The pure food law was opposed so violently that its passagewas delayed for a decade; yet it has worked unmixed and immediate good.The meat inspection law was even more violently assailed; and the samemen who now denounce the attitude of the National Government in seekingto oversee and control the workings of interstate common carriers andbusiness concerns, then asserted that we were "discrediting and ruininga great American industry." Two years have not elapsed, and already ithas become evident that the great benefit the law confers upon thepublic is accompanied by an equal benefit to the reputable packingestablishments. The latter are better off under the law than they werewithout it. The benefit to interstate common carriers and businessconcerns from the legislation I advocate would be equally marked.Incidentally, in the passage of the pure food law the action of thevarious State food and dairy commissioners showed in striking fashionhow much good for the whole people results from the hearty cooperationof the Federal and State officials in securing a given reform. It isprimarily to the action of these State commissioners that we owe theenactment of this law; for they aroused the people, first to demand theenactment and enforcement of State laws on the subject, and then theenactment of the Federal law, without which the State laws were largelyineffective. There must be the closest cooperation between the Nationaland State governments in administering these laws.In my Message to the Congress a year ago I spoke as follows of thecurrency:"I especially call your attention to the condition of our currencylaws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aidingthe enormous business development of the country, and within ten yearsthere has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to$33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating thatadditional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop seasonemphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be arevision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incurliability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there hasbeen a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30percent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding sixmonths. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise actionput a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse thansuch fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the uncertaintyfelt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercialinterests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for callmoney in New York attract money from the interior banks into thespeculative field. This depletes the fund that would otherwise beavailable for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced topay abnormal rates, so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increasedinterest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country."The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system isseriously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however,many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration becausethey are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend todisturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any planwhich would materially impair the value of the United States 2 per centbonds now pledged to secure circulation, the issue of which was madeunder conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not pressany especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expertcommittees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible andwhich certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedlybrought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treasury, theessential features of which have been approved by many prominentbankers and business men. According to this plan national banks shouldbe permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notesof a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drivethe notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would notpermit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but tomeet the emergency presented by times of stringency."I do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it toemphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some systemwhich shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoidall possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan wouldtend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which nowobtain in the New York market; for at present there is too muchcurrency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumulation at NewYork tempts bankers to lend it at low rates for speculative purposes;whereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgentneed for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It mustnever be forgotten that this question concerns business men generallyquite as much as bankers; especially is this true of stockmen, farmers,and business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of theyear the difference in interest rates between the East and the West isfrom 6 to 10 per cent, whereas in Canada the corresponding differenceis but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the interests ofwestern and southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests ofNew York or Chicago bankers, and must be drawn from the standpoints ofthe farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of thecity banker and the country banker."I again urge on the Congress the need of immediate attention to thismatter. We need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, ofcourse, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and securecurrency. There must always be the most rigid examination by theNational authorities. Provision should be made for an emergencycurrency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with aneffective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by theGovernment. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securitiesapproved by the Government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. Thiswould permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent,while securing its requirement as the demand fell off. It is worthinvestigating to determine whether officers and directors of nationalbanks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companiesshould be subject to the same supervision as banks; legislation to thiseffect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and theTerritories.Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on thesubject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by anypossibility guarantee the business community against the results ofspeculative folly any more than it can guarantee an individual againstthe results of his extravagance. When an individual mortgages his houseto buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy men, or menwho pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to becomesuch, indulge in reckless speculation especially if it is accompaniedby dishonesty they jeopardize not only their own future but the futureof all their innocent fellow citizens, for the expose the wholebusiness community to panic and distress.The income account of the Nation is in a most satisfactory condition.For the six fiscal years ending with the 1st of July last, the totalexpenditures and revenues of the National Government, exclusive of thepostal revenues and expenditures, were, in round numbers, revenues,$3,465,000,0000, and expenditures, $3,275,000,000. The net excess ofincome over expenditures, including in the latter the fifty millionsexpended for the Panama Canal, was one hundred and ninety milliondollars for the six years, an average of about thirty one millions ayear. This represents an approximation between income and outgo whichit would be hard to improve. The satisfactory working of the presenttariff law has been chiefly responsible for this excellent showing.Nevertheless, there is an evident and constantly growing feeling amongour people that the time is rapidly approaching when our system ofrevenue legislation must be revised.This country is definitely committed to the protective system and anyeffort to uproot it could not but cause widespread industrial disaster.In other words, the principle of the present tariff law could not withwisdom be changed. But in a country of such phenomenal growth as oursit is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws shouldbe carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or improperbenefits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue is provided, andthat our foreign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a minimuma tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an amplerevenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost ofproduction here and abroad; that is, the difference in the labor costhere and abroad, for the well being of the wage worker must ever be acardinal point of American policy. The question should be approachedpurely from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of thechange being such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbancein the business world, and to give the least play for selfish andfactional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sumtotal of changes represents the public good. This means that thesubject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding aPresidential election, because as a matter of fact experience hasconclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men totreat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment thewise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such election.When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and aninheritance tax should receive the careful attention of ourlegislators. In my judgment both of these taxes should be part of oursystem of Federal taxation. I speak diffidently about the income taxbecause one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitutional bythe Supreme Court; while in addition it is a difficult tax toadminister in its practical working, and great care would have to beexercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it wasmost desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, beworse than no tax at all; as the least desirable of all taxes is thetax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonestman. Nevertheless, a graduated income tax of the proper type would be adesirable feature of Federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that onemay be devised which the Supreme Court will declare constitutional. Theinheritance tax, however, is both a far better method of taxation, andfar more important for the purpose of having the fortunes of thecountry bear in proportion to their increase in size a correspondingincrease and burden of taxation. The Government has the absolute rightto decide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive a bequest ordevise from another, and this point in the devolution of property isespecially appropriate for the imposition of a tax. Laws imposing suchtaxes have repeatedly been placed upon the National statute books andas repeatedly declared constitutional by the courts; and these lawscontained the progressive principle, that is, after a certain amount isreached the bequest or gift, in life or death, is increasingly burdenedand the rate of taxation is increased in proportion to the remotenessof blood of the man receiving the bequest. These principles arerecognized already in the leading civilized nations of the world. InGreat Britain all the estates worth $5,000 or less are practicallyexempt from death duties, while the increase is such that when anestate exceeds five millions of dollars in value and passes to adistant kinsman or stranger in blood the Government receives all toldan amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate. In Franceso much of an inheritance as exceeds $10,000,000 pays over a fifth tothe State if it passes to a distant relative. The German law isespecially interesting to us because it makes the inheritance tax animperial measure while allotting to the individual States of the Empirea portion of the proceeds and permitting them to impose taxes inaddition to those imposed by the Imperial Government. Smallinheritances are exempt, but the tax is so sharply progressive thatwhen the inheritance is still not very large, provided it is not anagricultural or a forest land, it is taxed at the rate of 25 per centif it goes to distant relatives. There is no reason why in the UnitedStates the National Government should not impose inheritance taxes inaddition to those imposed by the States, and when we last had aninheritance tax about one half of the States levied such taxesconcurrently with the National Government, making a combined maximumrate, in some cases as high as 25 per cent. The French law has onefeature which is to be heartily commended. The progressive principle isso applied that each higher rate is imposed only on the excess abovethe amount subject to the next lower rate; so that each increase ofrate will apply only to a certain amount above a certain maximum. Thetax should if possible be made to bear more heavily upon those residingwithout the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a verylarge fortune is in no way such a tax upon thrift or industry as a likewould be on a small fortune. No advantage comes either to the countryas a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting thetransmission in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would beaffected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenueraising, such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality ofopportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood. Wehave not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which wouldtry to put laziness, thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par withindustry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up notmerely private property, but what is far more important, the home, thechief prop upon which our whole civilization stands. Such a theory, ifever adopted, would mean the ruin of the entire country a ruin whichwould bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shiftfor themselves. But proposals for legislation such as this hereinadvocated are directly opposed to this class of socialistic theories.Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out: The fact that thereare some respects in which men are obviously not equal; but also toinsist that there should be an equality of self respect and of mutualrespect, an equality of rights before the law, and at least anapproximate equality in the conditions under which each man obtains thechance to show the stuff that is in him when compared to his fellows.A few years ago there was loud complaint that the law could not beinvoked against wealthy offenders. There is no such complaint now. Thecourse of the Department of Justice during the last few years has beensuch as to make it evident that no man stands above the law, that nocorporation is so wealthy that it can not be held to account. TheDepartment of Justice has been as prompt to proceed against thewealthiest malefactor whose crime was one of greed and cunning as toproceed against the agitator who incites to brutal violence. Everythingthat can be done under the existing law, and with the existing state ofpublic opinion, which so profoundly influences both the courts andjuries, has been done. But the laws themselves need strengthening inmore than one important point; they should be made more definite, sothat no honest man can be led unwittingly to break them, and so thatthe real wrongdoer can be readily punished.Moreover, there must be the public opinion back of the laws or the lawsthemselves will be of no avail. At present, while the average jurymanundoubtedly wishes to see trusts broken up, and is quite ready to finethe corporation itself, he is very reluctant to find the facts provenbeyond a reasonable doubt when it comes to sending to jail a member ofthe business community for indulging in practices which are profoundlyunhealthy, but which, unfortunately, the business community has grownto recognize as well nigh normal. Both the present condition of the lawand the present temper of juries render it a task of extreme difficultyto get at the real wrongdoer in any such case, especially byimprisonment. Yet it is from every standpoint far preferable to punishthe prime offender by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation,with the attendant damage to stockholders.The two great evils in the execution of our criminal laws to day aresentimentality and technicality. For the latter the remedy must comefrom the hands of the legislatures, the courts, and the lawyers. Theother must depend for its cure upon the gradual growth of a soundpublic opinion which shall insist that regard for the law and thedemands of reason shall control all other influences and emotions inthe jury box. Both of these evils must be removed or public discontentwith the criminal law will continue.Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputescontinue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feelthat their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and ofspeech unwarrantably restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of theattack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly withoutwarrant; but I am constrained to express the belief that for some of itthere is warrant. This question is becoming more and more one of primeimportance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with it ineffective manner, it is certain ultimately to demand some form oflegislative action. It would be most unfortunate for our social welfareif we should permit many honest and law abiding citizens to feel thatthey had just cause for regarding our courts with hostility. Iearnestly commend to the attention of the Congress this matter, so thatsome way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions andprotect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably invades.Moreover, discontent is often expressed with the use of the process ofinjunction by the courts, not only in labor disputes, but where Statelaws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I aminformed that it will soon receive the consideration of the SupremeCourt.The Federal courts must of course decide ultimately what are therespective spheres of State and Nation in connection with any law,State or National, and they must decide definitely and finally inmatters affecting individual citizens, not only as to the rights andwrongs of labor but as to the rights and wrongs of capital; and theNational Government must always see that the decision of the court isput into effect. The process of injunction is an essential adjunct ofthe court\'s doing its work well; and as preventive measures are alwaysbetter than remedial, the wise use of this process is from everystandpoint commendable. But where it is recklessly or unnecessarilyused, the abuse should he censured, above all by the very men who areproperly anxious to prevent any effort to shear the courts of thisnecessary power. The court\'s decision must be final; the protest isonly against the conduct of individual judges in needlesslyanticipating such final decision, or in the tyrannical use of what isnominally a temporary injunction to accomplish what is in fact apermanent decision.The loss of life and limb from railroad accidents in this country hasbecome appalling. It is a subject of which the National Governmentshould take supervision. It might be well to begin by providing for aFederal inspection of interstate railroads somewhat along the lines ofFederal inspection of steamboats, although not going so far; perhaps atfirst all that it would be necessary to have would be some officerwhose duty would be to investigate all accidents on interstaterailroads and report in detail the causes thereof. Such an officershould make it his business to get into close touch with railroadoperating men so as to become thoroughly familiar with every side ofthe question, the idea being to work along the lines of the presentsteamboat inspection law.The National Government should be a model employer. It should demandthe highest quality of service from each of its employees and it shouldcare for all of them properly in return. Congress should adoptlegislation providing limited but definite compensation for accidentsto all workmen within the scope of the Federal power, includingemployees of navy yards and arsenals. In other words, a modelemployers\' liability act, far reaching and thoroughgoing, should beenacted which should apply to all positions, public and private, overwhich the National Government has jurisdiction. The number of accidentsto wage workers, including those that are preventable and those thatare not, has become appalling in the mechanical, manufacturing, andtransportation operations of the day. It works grim hardship to theordinary wage worker and his family to have the effect of such anaccident fall solely upon him; and, on the other hand, there are wholeclasses of attorneys who exist only by inciting men who may or may nothave been wronged to undertake suits for negligence. As a matter offact a suit for negligence is generally an inadequate remedy for theperson injured, while it often causes altogether disproportionateannoyance to the employer. The law should be made such that the paymentfor accidents by the employer would be automatic instead of being amatter for lawsuits. Workmen should receive certain and definitecompensation for all accidents in industry irrespective of negligence.The employer is the agent of the public and on his own responsibilityand for his own profit he serves the public. When he starts in motionagencies which create risks for others, he should take all the ordinaryand extraordinary risks involved; and the risk he thus at the momentassumes will ultimately be assumed, as it ought to be, by the generalpublic. Only in this way can the shock of the accident be diffused,instead of falling upon the man or woman least able to bear it, as isnow the case. The community at large should share the burdens as wellas the benefits of industry. By the proposed law, employers would gaina desirable certainty of obligation and get rid of litigation todetermine it, while the workman and his family would be relieved from acrushing load. With such a policy would come increased care, andaccidents would be reduced in number. The National laws providing foremployers\' liability on railroads engaged in interstate commerce andfor safety appliances, as well as for diminishing the hours anyemployee of a railroad should be permitted to work, should all bestrengthened wherever in actual practice they have shown weakness; theyshould be kept on the statute books in thoroughgoing form.The constitutionality of the employers\' liability act passed by thepreceding Congress has been carried before the courts. In twojurisdictions the law has been declared unconstitutional, and in threejurisdictions its constitutionality has been affirmed. The question hasbeen carried to the Supreme Court, the case has been heard by thattribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the eventthat the court should affirm the constitutionality of the act, I urgefurther legislation along the lines advocated in my Message to thepreceding Congress. The practice of putting the entire burden of lossto life or limb upon the victim or the victim\'s family is a form ofsocial injustice in which the United States stands in unenviableprominence. In both our Federal and State legislation we have, with fewexceptions, scarcely gone farther than the repeal of the fellow servantprinciple of the old law of liability, and in some of our States eventhis slight modification of a completely outgrown principle has not yetbeen secured. The legislation of the rest of the industrial worldstands out in striking contrast to our backwardness in this respect.Since 1895 practically every country of Europe, together with GreatBritain, New Zealand, Australia, British Columbia, and the Cape of GoodHope has enacted legislation embodying in one form or another thecomplete recognition of the principle which places upon the employerthe entire trade risk in the various lines of industry. I urge upon theCongress the enactment of a law which will at the same time bringFederal legislation up to the standard already established by all theEuropean countries, and which will serve as a stimulus to the variousStates to perfect their legislation in this regard.The Congress should consider the extension of the eight hour law. Theconstitutionality of the present law has recently been called intoquestion, and the Supreme Court has decided that the existinglegislation is unquestionably within the powers of the Congress. Theprinciple of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far aspracticable be extended to the entire work carried on by theGovernment; and the present law should be amended to embrace contractson those public works which the present wording of the act has beenconstrued to exclude. The general introduction of the eight hour dayshould be the goal toward which we should steadily tend, and theGovernment should set the example in this respect.Strikes and lockouts, with their attendant loss and suffering, continueto increase. For the five years ending December 31, 1905, the number ofstrikes was greater than those in any previous ten years and was doublethe number in the preceding five years. These figures indicate theincreasing need of providing some machinery to deal with this class ofdisturbance in the interest alike of the employer, the employee, andthe general public. I renew my previous recommendation that theCongress favorably consider the matter of creating the machinery forcompulsory investigation of such industrial controversies as are ofsufficient magnitude and of sufficient concern to the people of thecountry as a whole to warrant the Federal Government in taking action.The need for some provision for such investigation was forciblyillustrated during the past summer. A strike of telegraph operatorsseriously interfered with telegraphic communication, causing greatdamage to business interests and serious inconvenience to the generalpublic. Appeals were made to me from many parts of the country, fromcity councils, from boards of trade, from chambers of commerce, andfrom labor organizations, urging that steps be taken to terminate thestrike. Everything that could with any propriety be done by arepresentative of the Government was done, without avail, and for weeksthe public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had themachinery existed and had there been authority for compulsoryinvestigation of the dispute, the public would have been placed inpossession of the merits of the controversy, and public opinion wouldprobably have brought about a prompt adjustment.Each successive step creating machinery for the adjustment of labordifficulties must be taken with caution, but we should endeavor to makeprogress in this direction.The provisions of the act of 1898 creating the chairman of theInterstate Commerce Commission and the Commissioner of Labor a board ofmediation in controversies between interstate railroads and theiremployees has, for the first time, been subjected to serious testswithin the past year, and the wisdom of the experiment has been fullydemonstrated. The creation of a board for compulsory investigation incases where mediation fails and arbitration is rejected is the nextlogical step in a progressive program.It is certain that for some time to come there will be a constantincrease absolutely, and perhaps relatively, of those among ourcitizens who dwell in cities or towns of some size and who work forwages. This means that there will be an ever increasing need toconsider the problems inseparable from a great industrial civilization.Where an immense and complex business, especially in those branchesrelating to manufacture and transportation, is transacted by a largenumber of capitalists who employ a very much larger number ofwage earners, the former tend more and more to combine intocorporations and the latter into unions. The relations of thecapitalist and wage worker to one another, and of each to the generalpublic, are not always easy to adjust; and to put them and keep them ona satisfactory basis is one of the most important and one of the mostdelicate tasks before our whole civilization. Much of the work for theaccomplishment of this end must be done by the individuals concernedthemselves, whether singly or in combination; and the one fundamentalfact that must never be lost track of is that the character of theaverage man, whether he be a man of means or a man who works with hishands, is the most important factor in solving the problem aright. Butit is almost equally important to remember that without good laws it isalso impossible to reach the proper solution. It is idle to hold thatwithout good laws evils such as child labor, as the over working ofwomen, as the failure to protect employees from loss of life or limb,can be effectively reached, any more than the evils of rebates andstock watering can be reached without good laws. To fail to stop thesepractices by legislation means to force honest men into them, becauseotherwise the dishonest who surely will take advantage of them willhave everything their own way. If the States will correct these evils,well and good; but the Nation must stand ready to aid them.No question growing out of our rapid and complex industrial developmentis more important than that of the employment of women and children.The presence of women in industry reacts with extreme directness uponthe character of the home and upon family life, and the conditionssurrounding the employment of children bear a vital relation to ourfuture citizenship. Our legislation in those areas under the control ofthe Congress is very much behind the legislation of our moreprogressive States. A thorough and comprehensive measure should beadopted at this session of the Congress relating to the employment ofwomen and children in the District of Columbia and the Territories. Theinvestigation into the condition of women and children wage earnersrecently authorized and directed by the Congress is now being carriedon in the various States, and I recommend that the appropriation madelast year for beginning this work be renewed, in order that we may havethe thorough and comprehensive investigation which the subject demands.The National Government has as an ultimate resort for control of childlabor the use of the interstate commerce clause to prevent the productsof child labor from entering into interstate commerce. But before usingthis it ought certainly to enact model laws on the subject for theTerritories under its own immediate control.There is one fundamental proposition which can be laid down as regardsall these matters, namely: While honesty by itself will not solve theproblem, yet the insistence upon honesty not merely technical honesty,but honesty in purpose and spirit is an essential element in arrivingat a right conclusion. Vice in its cruder and more archaic forms shockseverybody; but there is very urgent need that public opinion should bejust as severe in condemnation of the vice which hides itself behindclass or professional loyalty, or which denies that it is vice if itcan escape conviction in the courts. The public and the representativesof the public, the high officials, whether on the bench or in executiveor legislative positions, need to remember that often the mostdangerous criminals, so far as the life of the Nation is concerned, arenot those who commit the crimes known to and condemned by the popularconscience for centuries, but those who commit crimes only renderedpossible by the complex conditions of our modern industrial life. Itmakes not a particle of difference whether these crimes are committedby a capitalist or by a laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer orrailroad man, or by a leading representative of a labor union.Swindling in stocks, corrupting legislatures, making fortunes by theinflation of securities, by wrecking railroads, by destroyingcompetitors through rebates these forms of wrongdoing in thecapitalist, are far more infamous than any ordinary form ofembezzlement or forgery; yet it is a matter of extreme difficulty tosecure the punishment of the man most guilty of them, most responsiblefor them. The business man who condones such conduct stands on a levelwith the labor man who deliberately supports a corrupt demagogue andagitator, whether head of a union or head of some municipality, becausehe is said to have "stood by the union." The members of the businesscommunity, the educators, or clergymen, who condone and encourage thefirst kind of wrongdoing, are no more dangerous to the community, butare morally even worse, than the labor men who are guilty of the secondtype of wrongdoing, because less is to be pardoned those who have nosuch excuse as is furnished either by ignorance or by dire need.  Whenthe Department of Agriculture was founded there was much sneering as toits usefulness. No Department of the Government, however, has moreemphatically vindicated its usefulness, and none save the Post OfficeDepartment comes so continually and intimately into touch with thepeople. The two citizens whose welfare is in the aggregate most vitalto the welfare of the Nation, and therefore to the welfare of all othercitizens, are the wage worker who does manual labor and the tiller ofthe soil, the farmer. There are, of course, kinds of labor where thework must be purely mental, and there are other kinds of labor where,under existing conditions, very little demand indeed is made upon themind, though I am glad to say that the proportion of men engaged inthis kind of work is diminishing. But in any community with the solid,healthy qualities which make up a really great nation the bulk of thepeople should do work which calls for the exercise of both body andmind. Progress can not permanently exist in the abandonment of physicallabor, but in the development of physical labor, so that it shallrepresent more and more the work of the trained mind in the trainedbody. Our school system is gravely defective in so far as it puts apremium upon mere literary training and tends therefore to train theboy away from the farm and the workshop. Nothing is more needed thanthe best type of industrial school, the school for mechanicalindustries in the city, the school for practically teaching agriculturein the country. The calling of the skilled tiller of the soil, thecalling of the skilled mechanic, should alike be recognized asprofessions, just as emphatically as the callings of lawyer, doctor,merchant, or clerk. The schools recognize this fact and it shouldequally be recognized in popular opinion. The young man who has thefarsightedness and courage to recognize it and to get over the ideathat it makes a difference whether what he earns is called salary orwages, and who refuses to enter the crowded field of the so calledprofessions, and takes to constructive industry instead, is reasonablysure of an ample reward in earnings, in health, in opportunity to marryearly, and to establish a home with a fair amount of freedom fromworry. It should be one of our prime objects to put both the farmer andthe mechanic on a higher plane of efficiency and reward, so as toincrease their effectiveness in the economic world, and therefore thedignity, the remuneration, and the power of their positions in thesocial world.No growth of cities, no growth of wealth, can make up for any loss ineither the number or the character of the farming population. We of theUnited States should realize this above almost all other peoples. Webegan our existence as a nation of farmers, and in every great crisisof the past a peculiar dependence has had to be placed upon the farmingpopulation; and this dependence has hitherto been justified. But it cannot be justified in the future if agriculture is permitted to sink inthe scale as compared with other employments. We can not afford to losethat preeminently typical American, the farmer who owns his ownmedium sized farm. To have his place taken by either a class of smallpeasant proprietors, or by a class of great landlords withtenant farmed estates would be a veritable calamity. The growth of ourcities is a good thing but only in so far as it does not mean a growthat the expense of the country farmer. We must welcome the rise ofphysical sciences in their application to agricultural practices, andwe must do all we can to render country conditions more easy andpleasant. There are forces which now tend to bring about both theseresults, but they are, as yet, in their infancy. The NationalGovernment through the Department of Agriculture should do all it canby joining with the State governments and with independent associationsof farmers to encourage the growth in the open farming country of suchinstitutional and social movements as will meet the demand of the besttype of farmers, both for the improvement of their farms and for thebetterment of the life itself. The Department of Agriculture has inmany places, perhaps especially in certain districts of the South,accomplished an extraordinary amount by cooperating with and teachingthe farmers through their associations, on their own soil, how toincrease their income by managing their farms better than they werehitherto managed. The farmer must not lose his independence, hisinitiative, his rugged self reliance, yet he must learn to work in theheartiest cooperation with his fellows, exactly as the business man haslearned to work; and he must prepare to use to constantly betteradvantage the knowledge that can be obtained from agriculturalcolleges, while he must insist upon a practical curriculum in theschools in which his children are taught. The Department of Agricultureand the Department of Commerce and Labor both deal with the fundamentalneeds of our people in the production of raw material and itsmanufacture and distribution, and, therefore, with the welfare of thosewho produce it in the raw state, and of those who manufacture anddistribute it. The Department of Commerce and Labor has but recentlybeen founded but has already justified its existence; while theDepartment of Agriculture yields to no other in the Government in thepractical benefits which it produces in proportion to the public moneyexpended. It must continue in the future to deal with growing crops asit has dealt in the past, but it must still further extend its field ofusefulness hereafter by dealing with live men, through a far reachingstudy and treatment of the problems of farm life alike from theindustrial and economic and social standpoint. Farmers must cooperatewith one another and with the Government, and the Government can bestgive its aid through associations of farmers, so as to deliver to thefarmer the large body of agricultural knowledge which has beenaccumulated by the National and State governments and by theagricultural colleges and schools.The grain producing industry of the country, one of the most importantin the United States, deserves special consideration at the hands ofthe Congress. Our grain is sold almost exclusively by grades. To securesatisfactory results in our home markets and to facilitate our tradeabroad, these grades should approximate the highest degree ofuniformity and certainty. The present diverse methods of inspection andgrading throughout the country under different laws and boards, resultin confusion and lack of uniformity, destroying that confidence whichis necessary for healthful trade. Complaints against the presentmethods have continued for years and they are growing in volume andintensity, not only in this country but abroad. I therefore suggest tothe Congress the advisability of a National system of inspection andgrading of grain entering into interstate and foreign commerce as aremedy for the present evils.The conservation of our natural resources and their proper useconstitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every otherproblem of our National life. We must maintain for our civilization theadequate material basis without which that civilization can not exist.We must show foresight, we must look ahead. As a nation we not onlyenjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but if this prosperityis used aright it is an earnest of future success such as no othernation will have. The reward of foresight for this Nation is great andeasily foretold. But there must be the look ahead, there must be arealization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our naturalresources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as toincrease its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of ourchildren the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down tothem amplified and developed. For the last few years, through severalagencies, the Government has been endeavoring to get our people to lookahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of ourresources in place of a haphazard striving for immediate profit. Ourgreat river systems should be developed as National water highways, theMississippi, with its tributaries, standing first in importance, andthe Columbia second, although there are many others of importance onthe Pacific, the Atlantic and the Gulf slopes. The National Governmentshould undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be made in thepresent Congress; and the greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi,should receive especial attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth ofthe Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterwaysleading from it to the East and the West. Such a waterway wouldpractically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart ofour country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. Ifbegun at once it can be carried through in time appreciably to relievethe congestion of our great freight carrying lines of railroads. Thework should be systematically and continuously carried forward inaccordance with some well conceived plan. The main streams should beimproved to the highest point of efficiency before the improvement ofthe branches is attempted; and the work should be kept free from everyfaint of recklessness or jobbery. The inland waterways which lie justback of the whole eastern and southern coasts should likewise bedeveloped. Moreover, the development of our waterways involves manyother important water problems, all of which should be considered aspart of the same general scheme. The Government dams should be used toproduce hundreds of thousands of horsepower as an incident to improvingnavigation; for the annual value of the unused water power of theUnited States perhaps exceeds the annual value of the products of allour mines. As an incident to creating the deep waterways down theMississippi, the Government should build along its whole lower lengthlevees which taken together with the control of the headwaters, will atonce and forever put a complete stop to all threat of floods in theimmensely fertile Delta region. The territory lying adjacent to theMississippi along its lower course will thereby become one of the mostprosperous and populous, as it already is one of the most fertile,farming regions in all the world. I have appointed an Inland WaterwaysCommission to study and outline a comprehensive scheme of developmentalong all the lines indicated. Later I shall lay its report before theCongress.Irrigation should be far more extensively developed than at present,not only in the States of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, butin many others, as, for instance, in large portions of the SouthAtlantic and Gulf States, where it should go hand in hand with thereclamation of swamp land. The Federal Government should seriouslydevote itself to this task, realizing that utilization of waterways andwater power, forestry, irrigation, and the reclamation of landsthreatened with overflow, are all interdependent parts of the sameproblem. The work of the Reclamation Service in developing the largeropportunities of the western half of our country for irrigation is moreimportant than almost any other movement. The constant purpose of theGovernment in connection with the Reclamation Service has been to usethe water resources of the public lands for the ultimate greatest goodof the greatest number; in other words, to put upon the land permanenthome makers, to use and develop it for themselves and for theirchildren and children\'s children. There has been, of course, oppositionto this work; opposition from some interested men who desire to exhaustthe land for their own immediate profit without regard to the welfareof the next generation, and opposition from honest and well meaning menwho did not fully understand the subject or who did not look far enoughahead. This opposition is, I think, dying away, and our people areunderstanding that it would be utterly wrong to allow a few individualsto exhaust for their own temporary personal profit the resources whichought to be developed through use so as to be conserved for thepermanent common advantage of the people as a whole.The effort of the Government to deal with the public land has beenbased upon the same principle as that of the Reclamation Service. Theland law system which was designed to meet the needs of the fertile andwell watered regions of the Middle West has largely broken down whenapplied to the dryer regions of the Great Plains, the mountains, andmuch of the Pacific slope, where a farm of 160 acres is inadequate forself support. In these regions the system lent itself to fraud, andmuch land passed out of the hands of the Government without passinginto the hands of the home maker. The Department of the Interior andthe Department of Justice joined in prosecuting the offenders againstthe law; and they have accomplished much, while where theadministration of the law has been defective it has been changed. Butthe laws themselves are defective. Three years ago a public landscommission was appointed to scrutinize the law, and defects, andrecommend a remedy. Their examination specifically showed the existenceof great fraud upon the public domain, and their recommendations forchanges in the law were made with the design of conserving the naturalresources of every part of the public lands by putting it to its bestuse. Especial attention was called to the prevention of settlement bythe passage of great areas of public land into the hands of a few men,and to the enormous waste caused by unrestricted grazing upon the openrange. The recommendations of the Public Lands Commission are sound,for they are especially in the interest of the actual homemaker; andwhere the small home maker can not at present utilize the land theyprovide that the Government shall keep control of it so that it may notbe monopolized by a few men. The Congress has not yet acted upon theserecommendations; but they are so just and proper, so essential to ourNational welfare, that I feel confident, if the Congress will take timeto consider them, that they will ultimately be adopted.Some such legislation as that proposed is essential in order topreserve the great stretches of public grazing land which are unfit forcultivation under present methods and are valuable only for the foragewhich they supply. These stretches amount in all to some 300,000,000acres, and are open to the free grazing of cattle, sheep, horses andgoats, without restriction. Such a system, or lack of system, meansthat the range is not so much used as wasted by abuse. As the Westsettles the range becomes more and more over grazed. Much of it can notbe used to advantage unless it is fenced, for fencing is the only wayby which to keep in check the owners of nomad flocks which roam hitherand thither, utterly destroying the pastures and leaving a waste behindso that their presence is incompatible with the presence ofhome makers. The existing fences are all illegal. Some of themrepresent the improper exclusion of actual settlers, actualhome makers, from territory which is usurped by great cattle companies.Some of them represent what is in itself a proper effort to use therange for those upon the land, and to prevent its use by nomadicoutsiders. All these fences, those that are hurtful and those that arebeneficial, are alike illegal and must come down. But it is an outragethat the law should necessitate such action on the part of theAdministration. The unlawful fencing of public lands for privategrazing must be stopped, but the necessity which occasioned it must beprovided for. The Federal Government should have control of the range,whether by permit or lease, as local necessities may determine. Suchcontrol could secure the great benefit of legitimate fencing, while atthe same time securing and promoting the settlement of the country. Insome places it may be that the tracts of range adjacent to thehomesteads of actual settlers should be allotted to them severally orin common for the summer grazing of their stock. Elsewhere it may bethat a lease system would serve the purpose; the leases to be temporaryand subject to the rights of settlement, and the amount charged beinglarge enough merely to permit of the efficient and beneficial controlof the range by the Government, and of the payment to the county of theequivalent of what it would otherwise receive in taxes. The destructionof the public range will continue until some such laws as these areenacted. Fully to prevent the fraud in the public lands which, throughthe joint action of the Interior Department and the Department ofJustice, we have been endeavoring to prevent, there must be furtherlegislation, and especially a sufficient appropriation to permit theDepartment of the Interior to examine certain classes of entries on theground before they pass into private ownership. The Government shouldpart with its title only to the actual home maker, not to theprofit maker who does not care to make a home. Our prime object is tosecure the rights and guard the interests of the small ranchman, theman who plows and pitches hay for himself. It is this small ranchman,this actual settler and homemaker, who in the long run is most hurt bypermitting thefts of the public land in whatever form.Optimism is a good characteristic, but if carried to an excess itbecomes foolishness. We are prone to speak of the resources of thiscountry as inexhaustible; this is not so. The mineral wealth of thecountry, the coal, iron, oil, gas, and the like, does not reproduceitself, and therefore is certain to be exhausted ultimately; andwastefulness in dealing with it to day means that our descendants willfeel the exhaustion a generation or two before they otherwise would.But there are certain other forms of waste which could be entirelystopped the waste of soil by washing, for instance, which is among themost dangerous of all wastes now in progress in the United States, iseasily preventable, so that this present enormous loss of fertility isentirely unnecessary. The preservation or replacement of the forests isone of the most important means of preventing this loss. We have made abeginning in forest preservation, but it is only a beginning. Atpresent lumbering is the fourth greatest industry in the United States;and yet, so rapid has been the rate of exhaustion of timber in theUnited States in the past, and so rapidly is the remainder beingexhausted, that the country is unquestionably on the verge of a timberfamine which will be felt in every household in the land. There hasalready been a rise in the price of lumber, but there is certain to bea more rapid and heavier rise in the future. The present annualconsumption of lumber is certainly three times as great as the annualgrowth; and if the consumption and growth continue unchanged,practically all our lumber will be exhausted in another generation,while long before the limit to complete exhaustion is reached thegrowing scarcity will make itself felt in many blighting ways upon ourNational welfare. About 20 per cent of our forested territory is nowreserved in National forests; but these do not include the mostvaluable timber lauds, and in any event the proportion is too small toexpect that the reserves can accomplish more than a mitigation of thetrouble which is ahead for the nation. Far more drastic action isneeded. Forests can be lumbered so as to give to the public the fulluse of their mercantile timber without the slightest detriment to theforest, any more than it is a detriment to a farm to furnish a harvest;so that there is no parallel between forests and mines, which can onlybe completely used by exhaustion. But forests, if used as all ourforests have been used in the past and as most of them are still used,will be either wholly destroyed, or so damaged that many decades haveto pass before effective use can be made of them again. All these factsare so obvious that it is extraordinary that it should be necessary torepeat them. Every business man in the land, every writer in thenewspapers, every man or woman of an ordinary school education, oughtto be able to see that immense quantities of timber are used in thecountry, that the forests which supply this timber are rapidly beingexhausted, and that, if no change takes place, exhaustion will comecomparatively soon, and that the effects of it will be felt severely inthe every day life of our people. Surely, when these facts are soobvious, there should be no delay in taking preventive measures. Yet weseem as a nation to be willing to proceed in this matter withhappy go lucky indifference even to the immediate future. It is thisattitude which permits the self interest of a very few persons to weighfor more than the ultimate interest of all our people. There arepersons who find it to their immense pecuniary benefit to destroy theforests by lumbering. They are to be blamed for thus sacrificing thefuture of the Nation as a whole to their own self interest of themoment; but heavier blame attaches to the people at large forpermitting such action, whether in the White Mountains, in the southernAlleghenies, or in the Rockies and Sierras. A big lumbering company,impatient for immediate returns and not caring to look far enoughahead, will often deliberately destroy all the good timber in a region,hoping afterwards to move on to some new country. The shiftless man ofsmall means, who does not care to become an actual home maker but wouldlike immediate profit, will find it to his advantage to take up timberland simply to turn it over to such a big company, and leave itvalueless for future settlers. A big mine owner, anxious only todevelop his mine at the moment, will care only to cut all the timberthat he wishes without regard to the future probably net looking aheadto the condition of the country when the forests are exhausted, anymore than he does to the condition when the mine is worked out. I donot blame these men nearly as much as I blame the supine publicopinion, the indifferent public opinion, which permits their action togo unchecked. Of course to check the waste of timber means that theremust be on the part of the public the acceptance of a temporaryrestriction in the lavish use of the timber, in order to prevent thetotal loss of this use in the future. There are plenty of men in publicand private life who actually advocate the continuance of the presentsystem of unchecked and wasteful extravagance, using as an argument thefact that to check it will of course mean interference with the easeand comfort of certain people who now get lumber at less cost than theyought to pay, at the expense of the future generations. Some of thesepersons actually demand that the present forest reserves be thrown opento destruction, because, forsooth, they think that thereby the price oflumber could be put down again for two or three or more years. Theirattitude is precisely like that of an agitator protesting against theoutlay of money by farmers on manure and in taking care of their farmsgenerally. Undoubtedly, if the average farmer were content absolutelyto ruin his farm, he could for two or three years avoid spending anymoney on it, and yet make a good deal of money out of it. But only asavage would, in his private affairs, show such reckless disregard ofthe future; yet it is precisely this reckless disregard of the futurewhich the opponents of the forestry system are now endeavoring to getthe people of the United States to show. The only trouble with themovement for the preservation of our forests is that it has not gonenearly far enough, and was not begun soon enough. It is a mostfortunate thing, however, that we began it when we did. We shouldacquire in the Appalachian and White Mountain regions all the forestlands that it is possible to acquire for the use of the Nation. Theselands, because they form a National asset, are as emphatically nationalas the rivers which they feed, and which flow through so many Statesbefore they reach the ocean.There should be no tariff on any forest product grown in this country;and, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice ofthe change being of course given to those engaged in the business so asto enable them to adjust themselves to the new conditions. The repealof the duty on wood pulp should if possible be accompanied by anagreement with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadianpulp wood.In the eastern United States the mineral fuels have already passed intothe hands of large private owners, and those of the West are rapidlyfollowing. It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and notwasted, and it would be well to protect the people against unjust andextortionate prices, so far as that can still be done. What has beenaccomplished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by theaction of the Administration, offers a striking example of the goodresults of such a policy. In my judgment the Government should have theright to keep the fee of the coal, oil, and gas fields in its ownpossession and to lease the rights to develop them under properregulations; or else, if the Congress will not adopt this method, thecoal deposits should be sold under limitations, to conserve them aspublic utilities, the right to mine coal being separated from the titleto the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked insufficient quantity by the several corporations. The presentlimitations have been absurd, excessive, and serve no useful purpose,and often render it necessary that there should be either fraud orclose abandonment of the work of getting out the coal.Work on the Panama Canal is proceeding in a highly satisfactory manner.In March last, John F. Stevens, chairman of the Commission and chiefengineer, resigned, and the Commission was reorganized and constitutedas follows: Lieut. Col. George W. Goethals, Corps. of Engineers, U. S.Army, chairman and chief engineer; Maj. D. D. Gall lard, Corps ofEngineers, U. S. Army; Maj. William L. Sibert, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army; Civil Engineer H. H. Rousseau, U. S. Navy; Mr. J. C. S.Blackburn; Col. W. C. Gorgas, U. S. Army, and Mr. Jackson Smith,Commissioners. This change of authority and direction went into effecton April 1, without causing a perceptible check to the progress of thework. In March the total excavation in the Culebra Cut, where effortwas chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic yards. In April this wasincreased to 879,527 cubic yards. There was a considerable decrease inthe output for May and June owing partly to the advent of the rainyseason and partly to temporary trouble with the steam shovel men overthe question of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to allparties and in July the total excavation advanced materially and inAugust the grand total from all points in the canal prism by steamshovels and dredges exceeded all previous United States records,reaching 1,274,404 cubic yards. In September this record was eclipsedand a total of 1,517,412 cubic yards was removed. Of this amount1,481,307 cubic yards were from the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yardswere from accessory works. These results were achieved in the rainyseason with a rainfall in August of 11.89 inches and in September of11.65 inches. Finally, in October, the record was again eclipsed, thetotal excavation being 1,868,729 cubic yards; a truly extraordinaryrecord, especially in view of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1inches. In fact, experience during the last two rainy seasonsdemonstrates that the rains are a less serious obstacle to progressthan has hitherto been supposed.Work on the locks and dams at Gatun, which began actively in Marchlast, has advanced so far that it is thought that masonry work on thelocks can be begun within fifteen months. In order to remove all doubtas to the satisfactory character of the foundations for the locks ofthe Canal, the Secretary of War requested three eminent civilengineers, of special experience in such construction, Alfred Noble,Frederic P. Stearns and John R. Freeman, to visit the Isthmus and makethorough personal investigations of the sites. These gentlemen went tothe Isthmus in April and by means of test pits which had been dug forthe purpose, they inspected the proposed foundations, and also examinedthe borings that had been made. In their report to the Secretary ofWar, under date of May 2, 1907, they said: "We found that all of thelocks, of the dimensions now proposed, will rest upon rock of suchcharacter that it will furnish a safe and stable foundation."Subsequent new borings, conducted by the present Commission, have fullyconfirmed this verdict. They show that the locks will rest on rock fortheir entire length. The cross section of the dam and method ofconstruction will be such as to insure against any slip or sloughingoff. Similar examination of the foundations of the locks and dams onthe Pacific side are in progress. I believe that the locks should bemade of a width of 120 feet.Last winter bids were requested and received for doing the work ofcanal construction by contract. None of them was found to besatisfactory and all were rejected. It is the unanimous opinion of thepresent Commission that the work can be done better, more cheaply, andmore quickly by the Government than by private contractors. Fully 80per cent of the entire plant needed for construction has been purchasedor contracted for; machine shops have been erected and equipped formaking all needed repairs to the plant; many thousands of employeeshave been secured; an effective organization has been perfected; arecruiting system is in operation which is capable of furnishing morelabor than can be used advantageously; employees are well sheltered andwell fed; salaries paid are satisfactory, and the work is not onlygoing forward smoothly, but it is producing results far in advance ofthe most sanguine anticipations. Under these favorable conditions, achange in the method of prosecuting the work would be unwise andunjustifiable, for it would inevitably disorganize existing conditions,check progress, and increase the cost and lengthen the time ofcompleting the Canal.The chief engineer and all his professional associates are firmlyconvinced that the 85 feet level lock canal which they are constructingis the best that could be desired. Some of them had doubts on thispoint when they went to the Isthmus. As the plans have developed undertheir direction their doubts have been dispelled. While they may decideupon changes in detail as construction advances they are in heartyaccord in approving the general plan. They believe that it provides acanal not only adequate to all demands that will be made upon it butsuperior in every way to a sea level canal. I concur in this belief.I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress a postalsavings bank system, as recommended by the Postmaster General. Theprimary object is to encourage among our people economy and thrift andby the use of postal savings banks to give them an opportunity tohusband their resources, particularly those who have not the facilitiesat hand for depositing their money in savings banks. Viewed, however,from the experience of the past few weeks, it is evident that theadvantages of such an institution are till more far reaching. Timiddepositors have withdrawn their savings for the time being fromnational banks, trust companies, and savings banks; individuals havehoarded their cash and the workingmen their earnings; all of whichmoney has been withheld and kept in hiding or in safe deposit box tothe detriment of prosperity. Through the agency of the postal savingsbanks such money would be restored to the channels of trade, to themutual benefit of capital and labor.I further commend to the Congress the consideration of thePostmaster General\'s recommendation for an extension of the parcelpost, especially on the rural routes. There are now 38,215 ruralroutes, serving nearly 15,000,000 people who do not have the advantagesof the inhabitants of cities in obtaining their supplies. Theserecommendations have been drawn up to benefit the farmer and thecountry storekeeper; otherwise, I should not favor them, for I believethat it is good policy for our Government to do everything possible toaid the small town and the country district. It is desirable that thecountry merchant should not be crushed out.The fourth class postmasters\' convention has passed a very strongresolution in favor of placing the fourth class postmasters under thecivil service law. The Administration has already put into effect thepolicy of refusing to remove any fourth class postmasters save forreasons connected with the good of the service; and it is endeavoringso far as possible to remove them from the domain of partisan politics.It would be a most desirable thing to put the fourth class postmastersin the classified service. It is possible that this might be donewithout Congressional action, but, as the matter is debatable, Iearnestly recommend that the Congress enact a law providing that theybe included under the civil service law and put in the classifiedservice.Oklahoma has become a State, standing on a full equality with her eldersisters, and her future is assured by her great natural resources. Theduty of the National Government to guard the personal and propertyrights of the Indians within her borders remains of course unchanged.I reiterate my recommendations of last year as regards Alaska. Someform of local self government should be provided, as simple andinexpensive as possible; it is impossible for the Congress to devotethe necessary time to all the little details of necessary Alaskanlegislation. Road building and railway building should be encouraged.The Governor of Alaska should be given an ample appropriation wherewithto organize a force to preserve the public peace. Whisky selling to thenatives should be made a felony. The coal land laws should be changedso as to meet the peculiar needs of the Territory. This should beattended to at once; for the present laws permit individuals to locatelarge areas of the public domain for speculative purposes; and cause animmense amount of trouble, fraud, and litigation. There should beanother judicial division established. As early as possible lighthousesand buoys should be established as aids to navigation, especially inand about Prince William Sound, and the survey of the coast completed.There is need of liberal appropriations for lighting and buoying thesouthern coast and improving the aids to navigation in southeasternAlaska. One of the great industries of Alaska, as of Puget Sound andthe Columbia, is salmon fishing. Gradually, by reason of lack of properlaws, this industry is being ruined; it should now be taken in charge,and effectively protected, by the United States Government.The courage and enterprise of the citizens of the far north west intheir projected Alaskan Yukon Pacific Exposition, to be held in 1909,should receive liberal encouragement. This exposition is notsentimental in its conception, but seeks to exploit the naturalresources of Alaska and to promote the commerce, trade, and industry ofthe Pacific States with their neighboring States and with our insularpossessions and the neighboring countries of the Pacific. Theexposition asks no loan from the Congress but seeks appropriations forNational exhibits and exhibits of the western dependencies of theGeneral Government. The State of Washington and the city of Seattlehave shown the characteristic western enterprise in large donations forthe conduct of this exposition in which other States are lendinggenerous assistance.The unfortunate failure of the shipping bill at the last session of thelast Congress was followed by the taking off of certain Pacificsteamships, which has greatly hampered the movement of passengersbetween Hawaii and the mainland. Unless the Congress is prepared bypositive encouragement to secure proper facilities in the way ofshipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then the coastwise shippinglaws should be so far relaxed as to prevent Hawaii suffering as it isnow suffering. I again call your attention to the capital importancefrom every standpoint of making Pearl Harbor available for the largestdeep water vessels, and of suitably fortifying the island.The Secretary of War has gone to the Philippines. On his return I shallsubmit to you his report on the islands.I again recommend that the rights of citizenship be conferred upon thepeople of Porto Rico.A bureau of mines should be created under the control and direction ofthe Secretary of the Interior; the bureau to have power to collectstatistics and make investigations in all matters pertaining to miningand particularly to the accidents and dangers of the industry. If thiscan not now be done, at least additional appropriations should be giventhe Interior Department to be used for the study of mining conditions,for the prevention of fraudulent mining schemes, for carrying on thework of mapping the mining districts, for studying methods forminimizing the accidents and dangers in the industry; in short, to aidin all proper ways the development of the mining industry.I strongly recommend to the Congress to provide funds for keeping upthe Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson; these funds to be usedthrough the existing Hermitage Association for the preservation of ahistoric building which should ever be dear to Americans.I further recommend that a naval monument be established in theVicksburg National Park. This national park gives a unique opportunityfor commemorating the deeds of those gallant men who fought on water,no less than of those who fought on land, in the great civil War.Legislation should be enacted at the present session of the Congressfor the Thirteenth Census. The establishment of the permanent CensusBureau affords the opportunity for a better census than we have everhad, but in order to realize the full advantage of the permanentorganization, ample time must be given for preparation.There is a constantly growing interest in this country in the questionof the public health. At last the public mind is awake to the fact thatmany diseases, notably tuberculosis, are National scourges. The work ofthe State and city boards of health should be supplemented by aconstantly increasing interest on the part of the National Government.The Congress has already provided a bureau of public health and hasprovided for a hygienic laboratory. There are other valuable lawsrelating to the public health connected with the various departments.This whole branch of the Government should be strengthened and aided inevery way.I call attention to two Government commissions which I have appointedand which have already done excellent work. The first of these has todo with the organization of the scientific work of the Government,which has grown up wholly without plan and is in consequence sounwisely distributed among the Executive Departments that much of itseffect is lost for the lack of proper coordination. This commission\'schief object is to introduce a planned and orderly development andoperation in the place of the ill assorted and often ineffectivegrouping and methods of work which have prevailed. This can not be donewithout legislation, nor would it be feasible to deal in detail with socomplex an administrative problem by specific provisions of law. Irecommend that the President be given authority to concentrate relatedlines of work and reduce duplication by Executive order throughtransfer and consolidation of lines of work.The second committee, that on Department methods, was instructed toinvestigate and report upon the changes needed to place the conduct ofthe executive force of the Government on the most economical andeffective basis in the light of the best modern business practice. Thecommittee has made very satisfactory progress. Antiquated practices andbureaucratic ways have been abolished, and a general renovation ofdepartmental methods has been inaugurated. All that can be done byExecutive order has already been accomplished or will be put intoeffect in the near future. The work of the main committee and itsseveral assistant committees has produced a wholesome awakening on thepart of the great body of officers and employees engaged in Governmentwork. In nearly every Department and office there has been a carefulself inspection for the purpose of remedying any defects before theycould be made the subject of adverse criticism. This has ledindividuals to a wider study of the work on which they were engaged,and this study has resulted in increasing their efficiency in theirrespective lines of work. There are recommendations of specialimportance from the committee on the subject of personnel and theclassification of salaries which will require legislative action beforethey can be put into effect. It is my intention to submit to theCongress in the near future a special message on those subjects.Under our form of government voting is not merely a right but a duty,and, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be agood citizen. It is well to provide that corporations shall notcontribute to Presidential or National campaigns, and furthermore toprovide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures.There is, however, always danger in laws of this kind, which from theirvery nature are difficult of enforcement; the danger being lest they beobeyed only by the honest, and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so as toact only as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such law wouldhamper an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own wayinto office. There is a very radical measure which would, I believe,work a substantial improvement in our system of conducting a campaign,although I am well aware that it will take some time for people so tofamiliarize themselves with such a proposal as to be willing toconsider its adoption. The need for collecting large campaign fundswould vanish if Congress provided an appropriation for the proper andlegitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, anappropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thoroughorganization and machinery, which requires a large expenditure ofmoney. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receivingcampaign funds from the Treasury should accept more than a fixed amountfrom any individual subscriber or donor; and the necessary publicityfor receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided.There should be a National gallery of art established in the capitalcity of this country. This is important not merely to the artistic butto the material welfare of the country; and the people are to becongratulated on the fact that the movement to establish such a galleryis taking definite form under the guidance of the SmithsonianInstitution. So far from there being a tariff on works of art broughtinto the country, their importation should be encouraged in every way.There have been no sufficient collections of objects of art by theGovernment, and what collections have been acquired are scattered andare generally placed in unsuitable and imperfectly lighted galleries.The Biological Survey is quietly working for the good of ouragricultural interests, and is an excellent example of a Governmentbureau which conducts original scientific research the findings ofwhich are of much practical utility. For more than twenty years it hasstudied the food habits of birds and mammals that are injurious orbeneficial to agriculture, horticulture, and forestry; has distributedillustrated bulletins on the subject, and has labored to securelegislative protection for the beneficial species. The cottonboll weevil, which has recently overspread the cotton belt of Texas andis steadily extending its range, is said to cause an annual loss ofabout $3,000,000. The Biological Survey has ascertained and gives widepublicity to the fact that at least 43 kinds of birds prey upon thisdestructive insect. It has discovered that 57 species of birds feedupon scale insects dreaded enemies of the fruit grower. It has shownthat woodpeckers as a class, by destroying the larvae of wood boringinsects, are so essential to tree life that it is doubtful if ourforests could exist without them. It has shown that cuckoos and oriolesare the natural enemies of the leaf eating caterpillars that destroyour shade and fruit trees; that our quails and sparrows consumeannually hundreds of tons of seeds of noxious weeds; that hawks andowls as a class (excepting the few that kill poultry and game birds)are markedly beneficial, spending their lives in catching grasshoppers,mice, and other pests that prey upon the products of husbandry. It hasconducted field experiments for the purpose of devising and perfectingsimple methods for holding in check the hordes of destructiverodents rats, mice, rabbits, gophers, prairie dogs, and groundsquirrels which annually destroy crops worth many millions of dollars;and it has published practical directions for the destruction of wolvesand coyotes on the stock ranges of the West, resulting during the pastyear in an estimated saving of cattle and sheep valued at upwards of amillion dollars.It has inaugurated a system of inspection at the principal ports ofentry on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts by means of which theintroduction of noxious mammals and birds is prevented, thus keepingout the mongoose and certain birds which are as much to be dreaded asthe previously introduced English sparrow and the house rats and mice.In the interest of game protection it has cooperated with localofficials in every State in the Union, has striven to promote uniformlegislation in the several States, has rendered important service inenforcing the Federal law regulating interstate traffic in game, andhas shown how game protection may be made to yield a large revenue tothe State a revenue amounting in the case of Illinois to $128,000 in asingle year.The Biological Survey has explored the faunas and floras of Americawith reference to the distribution of animals and plants; it hasdefined and mapped the natural life areas areas in which, by reason ofprevailing climatic conditions, certain kinds of animals and plantsoccur and has pointed out the adaptability of these areas to thecultivation of particular crops. The results of these investigationsare not only of high educational value but are worth each year to theprogressive farmers of the country many times the cost of maintainingthe Survey, which, it may be added, is exceedingly small. I recommendto Congress that this bureau, whose usefulness is seriously handicappedby lack of funds, be granted an appropriation in some degreecommensurate with the importance of the work it is doing.I call your especial attention to the unsatisfactory condition of ourforeign mail service, which, because of the lack of American steamshiplines is now largely done through foreign lines, and which,particularly so far as South and Central America are concerned, is donein a manner which constitutes a serious barrier to the extension of ourcommerce.The time has come, in my judgment, to set to work seriously to make ourocean mail service correspond more closely with our recent commercialand political development. A beginning was made by the ocean mail actof March 3, 1891, but even at that time the act was known to beinadequate in various particulars. Since that time events have movedrapidly in our history. We have acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, andlesser islands in the Pacific. We are steadily prosecuting the greatwork of uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the Atlantic and thePacific. To a greater extent than seemed probable even a dozen yearsago, we may look to an American future on the sea worthy of thetraditions of our past. As the first step in that direction, and thestep most feasible at the present time, I recommend the extension ofthe ocean mail act of 1891. This act has stood for some years free fromsuccessful criticism of its principle and purpose. It was based ontheories of the obligations of a great maritime nation, undisputed inour own land and followed by other nations since the beginning of steamnavigation. Briefly those theories are, that it is the duty of afirst class Power so far as practicable to carry its ocean mails underits own flag; that the fast ocean steamships and their crews, requiredfor such mail service, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea power of anation. Furthermore, the construction of such steamships insures themaintenance in an efficient condition of the shipyards in which ourbattleships must be built.The expenditure of public money for the Performance of such necessaryfunctions of government is certainly warranted, nor is it necessary todwell upon the incidental benefits to our foreign commerce, to theshipbuilding industry, and to ship owning and navigation which willaccompany the discharge of these urgent public duties, though they,too, should have weight.The only serious question is whether at this time we can afford toimprove our ocean mail service as it should be improved. All doubt onthis subject is removed by the reports of the Post Office Department.For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1907, that Department estimates thatthe postage collected on the articles exchanged with foreign countriesother than Canada and Mexico amounted to $6,579,043.48, or$3,637,226.81 more than the net cost of the service exclusive of thecost of transporting the articles between the United States exchangepost offices and the United States post offices at which they weremailed or delivered. In other words, the Government of the UnitedStates, having assumed a monopoly of carrying the mails for the people,making a profit of over $3,600,000 by rendering a cheap and inefficientservice. That profit I believe should be devoted to strengtheningmaritime power in those directions where it will best promote ourprestige. The country is familiar with the facts of our maritimeimpotence in the harbors of the great and friendly Republics of SouthAmerica. Following the failure of the shipbuilding bill we lost ouronly American line of steamers to Australasia, and that loss on thePacific has become a serious embarrassment to the people of Hawaii, andhas wholly cut off the Samoan islands from regular communication withthe Pacific coast. Puget Sound, in the year, has lost over half (fourout of seven) of its American steamers trading with the Orient.We now pay under the act of 1891 $4 a statute mile outward to 20 knotAmerican mail steamships, built according to naval plans, available ascruisers, and manned by Americans. Steamships of that speed areconfined exclusively to trans Atlantic trade with New York. Tosteamships of 16 knots or over only $2 a mile can be paid, and it issteamships of this speed and type which are needed to meet therequirements of mail service to South America, Asia (including thePhilippines), and Australia. I strongly recommend, therefore, a simpleamendment to the ocean mail act of 1891 which shall authorize thePostmaster General in his discretion to enter into contracts for thetransportation of mails to the Republics of South America, to Asia, thePhilippines, and Australia at a rate not to exceed $4 a mile forsteamships of 16 knots speed or upwards, subject to the restrictionsand obligations of the act of 1891. The profit of $3,600,000 which hasbeen mentioned will fully cover the maximum annual expenditure involvedin this recommendation, and it is believed will in time establish thelines so urgently needed. The proposition involves no new principle,but permits the efficient discharge of public functions nowinadequately performed or not performed at all.Not only there is not now, but there never has been, any other nationin the world so wholly free from the evils of militarism as is ours.There never has been any other large nation, not even China, which forso long a period has had relatively to its numbers so small a regulararmy as has ours. Never at any time in our history has this Nationsuffered from militarism or been in the remotest danger of sufferingfrom militarism. Never at any time of our history has the Regular Armybeen of a size which caused the slightest appreciable tax upon thetax paying citizens of the Nation. Almost always it has been too smallin size and underpaid. Never in our entire history has the Nationsuffered in the least particular because too much care has been givento the Army, too much prominence given it, too much money spent uponit, or because it has been too large. But again and again we havesuffered because enough care has not been given to it, because it hasbeen too small, because there has not been sufficient preparation inadvance for possible war. Every foreign war in which we have engagedhas cost us many times the amount which, if wisely expended during thepreceding years of peace on the Regular Army, would have insured thewar ending in but a fraction of the time and but for a fraction of thecost that was actually the case. As a Nation we have always beenshortsighted in providing for the efficiency of the Army in time ofpeace. It is nobody\'s especial interest to make such provision and noone looks ahead to war at any period, no matter how remote, as being aserious possibility; while an improper economy, or ratherniggardliness, can be practiced at the expense of the Army with thecertainty that those practicing it will not be called to accounttherefor, but that the price will be paid by the unfortunate personswho happen to be in office when a war does actually come.I think it is only lack of foresight that troubles us, not anyhostility to the Army. There are, of course, foolish people whodenounce any care of the Army or Navy as "militarism," but I do notthink that these people are numerous. This country has to contend now,and has had to contend in the past, with many evils, and there is amplescope for all who would work for reform. But there is not one evil thatnow exists, or that ever has existed in this country, which is, or everhas been, owing in the smallest part to militarism. Declamation againstmilitarism has no more serious place in an earnest and intelligentmovement for righteousness in this country than declamation against theworship of Baal or Astaroth. It is declamation against a non existentevil, one which never has existed in this country, and which has notthe slightest chance of appearing here. We are glad to help in anymovement for international peace, but this is because we sincerelybelieve that it is our duty to help all such movements provided theyare sane and rational, and not because there is any tendency towardmilitarism on our part which needs to be cured. The evils we have tofight are those in connection with industrialism, not militarism.Industry is always necessary, just as war is sometimes necessary. Eachhas its price, and industry in the United States now exacts, and hasalways exacted, a far heavier toll of death than all our wars puttogether. The statistics of the railroads of this country for the yearended June 30, 1906, the last contained in the annual statisticalreport of the Interstate Commerce Commission, show in that one year atotal of 108,324 casualties to persons, of which 10,618 represent thenumber of persons killed. In that wonderful hive of human activity,Pittsburg, the deaths due to industrial accidents in 1906 were 919, allthe result of accidents in mills, mines or on railroads. For the entirecountry, therefore, it is safe to say that the deaths due to industrialaccidents aggregate in the neighborhood of twenty thousand a year. Sucha record makes the death rate in all our foreign wars utterly trivialby comparison. The number of deaths in battle in all the foreign warsput together, for the last century and a quarter, aggregateconsiderably less than one year\'s death record for our industries. Amere glance at these figures is sufficient to show the absurdity of theoutcry against militarism.But again and again in the past our little Regular Army has renderedservice literally vital to the country, and it may at any time have todo so in the future. Its standard of efficiency and instruction ishigher now than ever in the past. But it is too small. There are notenough officers; and it is impossible to secure enough enlisted men. Weshould maintain in peace a fairly complete skeleton of a large army. Agreat and long continued war would have to be fought by volunteers. Butmonths would pass before any large body of efficient volunteers couldbe put in the field, and our Regular Army should be large enough tomeet any immediate need. In particular it is essential that we shouldpossess a number of extra officers trained in peace to performefficiently the duties urgently required upon the breaking out of war.The Medical Corps should be much larger than the needs of our RegularArmy in war. Yet at present it is smaller than the needs of the servicedemand even in peace. The Spanish war occurred less than ten years ago.The chief loss we suffered in it was by disease among the regimentswhich never left the country. At the moment the Nation seemed deeplyimpressed by this fact; yet seemingly it has already been forgotten,for not the slightest effort has been made to prepare a medical corpsof sufficient size to prevent the repetition of the same disaster on amuch larger scale if we should ever be engaged in a serious conflict.The trouble in the Spanish war was not with the then existing officialsof the War Department; it was with the representatives of the people asa whole who, for the preceding thirty years, had declined to make thenecessary provision for the Army. Unless ample provision is now made byCongress to put the Medical Corps where it should be put disaster inthe next war is inevitable, and the responsibility will not lie withthose then in charge of the War Department, but with those who nowdecline to make the necessary provision. A well organized medicalcorps, thoroughly trained before the advent of war in all the importantadministrative duties of a military sanitary corps, is essential to theefficiency of any large army, and especially of a large volunteer army.Such knowledge of medicine and surgery as is possessed by the medicalprofession generally will not alone suffice to make an efficientmilitary surgeon. He must have, in addition, knowledge of theadministration and sanitation of large field hospitals and camps, inorder to safeguard the health and lives of men intrusted in greatnumbers to his care. A bill has long been pending before the Congressfor the reorganization of the Medical Corps; its passage is urgentlyneeded.But the Medical Department is not the only department for whichincreased provision should be made. The rate of pay for the officersshould be greatly increased; there is no higher type of citizen thanthe American regular officer, and he should have a fair reward for hisadmirable work. There should be a relatively even greater increase inthe pay for the enlisted men. In especial provision should be made forestablishing grades equivalent to those of warrant officers in the Navywhich should be open to the enlisted men who serve sufficiently longand who do their work well. Inducements should be offered sufficient toencourage really good men to make the Army a life occupation. The primeneeds of our present Army is to secure and retain competentnoncommissioned officers. This difficulty rests fundamentally on thequestion of pay. The noncommissioned officer does not correspond withan unskilled laborer; he corresponds to the best type of skilledworkman or to the subordinate official in civil institutions. Wageshave greatly increased in outside occupations in the last forty yearsand the pay of the soldier, like the pay of the officers, should beproportionately increased. The first sergeant of a company, if a goodman, must be one of such executive and administrative ability, and suchknowledge of his trade, as to be worth far more than we at present payhim. The same is true of the regimental sergeant major. These menshould be men who had fully resolved to make the Army a life occupationand they should be able to look forward to ample reward; while only menproperly qualified should be given a chance to secure these finalrewards. The increase over the present pay need not be great in thelower grades for the first one or two enlistments, but the increaseshould be marked for the noncommissioned officers of the upper gradeswho serve long enough to make it evident that they intend to staypermanently in the Army, while additional pay should be given for highqualifications in target practice. The position of warrant officershould be established and there should be not only an increase of pay,but an increase of privileges and allowances and dignity, so as to makethe grade open to noncommissioned officers capable of filling themdesirably from every standpoint. The rate of desertion in our Army nowin time of peace is alarming. The deserter should be treated by publicopinion as a man guilty of the greatest crime; while on the other handthe man who serves steadily in the Army should be treated as what heis, that is, as preeminently one of the best citizens of this Republic.After twelve years\' service in the Army, my own belief is that the manshould be given a preference according to his ability for certain typesof office over all civilian applicants without examination. This shouldalso apply, of course, to the men who have served twelve years in theNavy. A special corps should be provided to do the manual labor nownecessarily demanded of the privates themselves.Among the officers there should be severe examinations to weed out theunfit up to the grade of major. From that position on appointmentsshould be solely by selection and it should be understood that a man ofmerely average capacity could never get beyond the position of major,while every man who serves in any grade a certain length of time priorto promotion to the next grade without getting the promotion to thenext grade should be forthwith retired. The practice marches and fieldmaneuvers of the last two or three years have been invaluable to theArmy. They should be continued and extended. A rigid and not aperfunctory examination of physical capacity has been provided for thehigher grade officers. This will work well. Unless an officer has agood physique, unless he can stand hardship, ride well, and walkfairly, he is not fit for any position, even after he has become acolonel. Before he has become a colonel the need for physical fitnessin the officers is almost as great as in the enlisted man. I hopespeedily to see introduced into the Army a far more rigid andthoroughgoing test of horsemanship for all field officers than atpresent. There should be a Chief of Cavalry just as there is a Chief ofArtillery.Perhaps the most important of all legislation needed for the benefit ofthe Army is a law to equalize and increase the pay of officers andenlisted men of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Revenue CutterService. Such a bill has been prepared, which it is hoped will meetwith your favorable consideration. The next most essential measure isto authorize a number of extra officers as mentioned above. To make theArmy more attractive to enlisted men, it is absolutely essential tocreate a service corps, such as exists in nearly every modern army inthe world, to do the skilled and unskilled labor, inseparably connectedwith military administration, which is now exacted, without justcompensation, of enlisted men who voluntarily entered the Army to doservice of an altogether different kind. There are a number of otherlaws necessary to so organize the Army as to promote its efficiency andfacilitate its rapid expansion in time of war; but the above are themost important.It was hoped The Hague Conference might deal with the question of thelimitation of armaments. But even before it had assembled informalinquiries had developed that as regards naval armaments, the only onesin which this country had any interest, it was hopeless to try todevise any plan for which there was the slightest possibility ofsecuring the assent of the nations gathered at The Hague. No plan waseven proposed which would have had the assent of more than one firstclass Power outside of the United States. The only plan that seemed atall feasible, that of limiting the size of battleships, met with nofavor at all. It is evident, therefore, that it is folly for thisNation to base any hope of securing peace on any internationalagreement as to the limitations of armaments. Such being the fact itwould be most unwise for us to stop the upbuilding of our Navy. Tobuild one battleship of the best and most advanced type a year wouldbarely keep our fleet up to its present force. This is not enough. Inmy judgment, we should this year provide for four battleships. But itis idle to build battleships unless in addition to providing the men,and the means for thorough training, we provide the auxiliaries forthem, unless we provide docks, the coaling stations, the colliers andsupply ships that they need. We are extremely deficient in coalingstations and docks on the Pacific, and this deficiency should notlonger be permitted to exist. Plenty of torpedo boats and destroyersshould be built. Both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,fortifications of the best type should be provided for all our greatestharbors.We need always to remember that in time of war the Navy is not to beused to defend harbors and sea coast cities; we should perfect oursystem of coast fortifications. The only efficient use for the Navy isfor offense. The only way in which it can efficiently protect our owncoast against the possible action of a foreign navy is by destroyingthat foreign navy. For defense against a hostile fleet which actuallyattacks them, the coast cities must depend upon their forts, mines,torpedoes, submarines, and torpedo boats and destroyers. All of thesetogether are efficient for defensive purposes, but they in no waysupply the place of a thoroughly efficient navy capable of acting onthe offensive; for parrying never yet won a fight. It can only be wonby hard hitting, and an aggressive sea going navy alone can do thishard hitting of the offensive type. But the forts and the like arenecessary so that the Navy may be footloose. In time of war there issure to be demand, under pressure, of fright, for the ships to bescattered so as to defend all kind of ports. Under penalty of terribledisaster, this demand must be refused. The ships must be kept together,and their objective made the enemies\' fleet. If fortifications aresufficiently strong, no modern navy will venture to attack them, solong as the foe has in existence a hostile navy of anything like thesame size or efficiency. But unless there exists such a navy then thefortifications are powerless by themselves to secure the victory. Forof course the mere deficiency means that any resolute enemy can at hisleisure combine all his forces upon one point with the certainty thathe can take it.Until our battle fleet is much larger than at present it should neverbe split into detachments so far apart that they could not in event ofemergency be speedily united. Our coast line is on the Pacific just asmuch as on the Atlantic. The interests of California, Oregon, andWashington are as emphatically the interests of the whole Union asthose of Maine and New York, of Louisiana and Texas. The battle fleetshould now and then be moved to the Pacific, just as at other times itshould be kept in the Atlantic. When the Isthmian Canal is built thetransit of the battle fleet from one ocean to the other will becomparatively easy. Until it is built I earnestly hope that the battlefleet will be thus shifted between the two oceans every year or two.The marksmanship on all our ships has improved phenomenally during thelast five years. Until within the last two or three years it was notpossible to train a battle fleet in squadron maneuvers under serviceconditions, and it is only during these last two or three years thatthe training under these conditions has become really effective.Another and most necessary stride in advance is now being taken. Thebattle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan to visit thePacific coast.. Sixteen battleships are going under the command ofRear Admiral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two otherbattleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain torpedodestroyers are also going. No fleet of such size has ever made such avoyage, and it will be of very great educational use to all engaged init. The only way by which to teach officers and men how to handle thefleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of waris to have them practice under similar conditions in time of peace.Moreover, the only way to find out our actual needs is to perform intime of peace whatever maneuvers might be necessary in time of war.After war is declared it is too late to find out the needs; that meansto invite disaster. This trip to the Pacific will show what some of ourneeds are and will enable us to provide for them. The proper place foran officer to learn his duty is at sea, and the only way in which anavy can ever be made efficient is by practice at sea, under all theconditions which would have to be met if war existed.I bespeak the most liberal treatment for the officers and enlisted menof the Navy. It is true of them, as likewise of the officers andenlisted men of the Army, that they form a body whose interests shouldbe close to the heart of every good American. In return the most rigidperformance of duty should be exacted from them. The reward should beample when they do their best; and nothing less than their best shouldbe tolerated. It is idle to hope for the best results when the men inthe senior grades come to those grades late in life and serve too shorta time in them. Up to the rank of lieutenant commander promotion in theNavy should be as now, by seniority, subject, however, to suchrigid tests as would eliminate the unfit. After the grade oflieutenant commander, that is, when we come to the grade of commandrank, the unfit should be eliminated in such manner that only theconspicuously fit would remain, and sea service should be a principaltest of fitness. Those who are passed by should, after a certain lengthof service in their respective grades, be retired. Of a given number ofmen it may well be that almost all would make good lieutenants and mostof them good lieutenant commanders, while only a minority be fit to becaptains, and but three or four to be admirals. Those who object topromotion otherwise than by mere seniority should reflect upon theelementary fact that no business in private life could be successfullymanaged if those who enter at the lowest rungs of the ladder shouldeach in turn, if he lived, become the head of the firm, its activedirector, and retire after he had held the position a few months. Onits face such a scheme is an absurdity. Chances for improper favoritismcan be minimized by a properly formed board; such as the board of lastJune, which did such conscientious and excellent work in elimination.If all that ought to be done can not now be done, at least let abeginning be made. In my last three annual Messages, and in a specialMessage to the last Congress, the necessity for legislation that willcause officers of the line of the Navy to reach the grades of captainand rear admiral at less advanced ages and which will cause them tohave more sea training and experience in the highly responsible dutiesof those grades, so that they may become thoroughly skillful inhandling battleships, divisions, squadrons, and fleets in action, hasbeen fully explained and urgently recommended. Upon this subject theSecretary of the Navy has submitted detailed and definiterecommendations which have received my approval, and which, if enactedinto law, will accomplish what is immediately necessary, and will, ascompared with existing law, make a saving of more than five millions ofdollars during the next seven years. The navy personnel act of 1899 hasaccomplished all that was expected of it in providing satisfactoryperiods of service in the several subordinate grades, from the grade ofensign to the grade of lieutenant commander, but the law is inadequatein the upper grades and will continue to be inadequate on account ofthe expansion of the personnel since its enactment. Your attention isinvited to the following quotations from the report of the personnelboard of 1906, of which the Assistant Secretary of the Navy waspresident:"Congress has authorized a considerable increase in the number ofmidshipmen at the Naval Academy, and these midshipmen upon graduationare promoted to ensign and lieutenant (junior grade). But no provisionhas been made for a corresponding increase in the upper grades, theresult being that the lower grades will become so congested that amidshipman now in one of the lowest classes at Annapolis may possiblynot be promoted to lieutenant until he is between 45 and 50 years ofage. So it will continue under the present law, congesting at the topand congesting at the bottom. The country fails to get from theofficers of the service the best that is in them by not providingopportunity for their normal development and training. The boardbelieves that this works a serious detriment to the efficiency of theNavy and is a real menace to the public safety."As stated in my special Message to the last Congress: "I am firmly ofthe opinion that unless the present conditions of the highercommissioned personnel is rectified by judicious legislation the futureof our Navy will be gravely compromised." It is also urgently necessaryto increase the efficiency of the Medical Corps of the Navy. Speciallegislation to this end has already been proposed; and I trust it maybe enacted without delay.It must be remembered that everything done in the Navy to fit it to dowell in time of war must be done in time of peace. Modern wars areshort; they do not last the length of time requisite to build abattleship; and it takes longer to train the officers and men to dowell on a battleship than it takes to build it. Nothing effective canbe done for the Navy once war has begun, and the result of the war, ifthe combatants are otherwise equally matched, will depend upon whichpower has prepared best in time of peace. The United States Navy is thebest guaranty the Nation has that its honor and interest will not beneglected; and in addition it offers by far the best insurance forpeace that can by human ingenuity be devised.I call attention to the report of the official Board of Visitors to theNaval Academy at Annapolis which has been forwarded to the Congress.The report contains this paragraph:"Such revision should be made of the courses of study and methods ofconducting and marking examinations as will develop and bring out theaverage all round ability of the midshipman rather than to give himprominence in any one particular study. The fact should be kept in mindthat the Naval Academy is not a university but a school, the primaryobject of which is to educate boys to be efficient naval officers.Changes in curriculum, therefore, should be in the direction of makingthe course of instruction less theoretical and more practical. Noportion of any future class should be graduated in advance of the fullfour years\' course, and under no circumstances should the standard ofinstruction be lowered. The Academy in almost all of its departments isnow magnificently equipped, and it would be very unwise to make thecourse of instruction less exacting than it is to day."Acting upon this suggestion I designated three seagoing officers, Capt.Richard Wainwright, Commander Robert S. Griffin, and Lieut. CommanderAlbert L. Key, all graduates of the Academy, to investigate conditionsand to recommend to me the best method of carrying into effect thisgeneral recommendation. These officers performed the duty promptly andintelligently, and, under the personal direction of Capt. Charles J.Badger, Superintendent of the Academy, such of the proposed changes aswere deemed to be at present advisable were put into effect at thebeginning of the academic year, October 1, last. The results, I amconfident, will be most beneficial to the Academy, to the midshipmen,and to the Navy.In foreign affairs this country\'s steady policy is to behave towardother nations as a strong and self respecting man should behave towardthe other men with whom he is brought into contact. In other words, ouraim is disinterestedly to help other nations where such help can bewisely given without the appearance of meddling with what does notconcern us; to be careful to act as a good neighbor; and at the sametime, in good natured fashion, to make it evident that we do not intendto be imposed upon.The Second International Peace Conference was convened at The Hague onthe 15th of June last and remained in session until the 18th ofOctober. For the first time the representatives of practically all thecivilized countries of the world united in a temperate and kindlydiscussion of the methods by which the causes of war might be narrowedand its injurious effects reduced.Although the agreements reached in the Conference did not in anydirection go to the length hoped for by the more sanguine, yet in manydirections important steps were taken, and upon every subject on theprogramme there was such full and considerate discussion as to justifythe belief that substantial progress has been made toward furtheragreements in the future. Thirteen conventions were agreed uponembodying the definite conclusions which had been reached, andresolutions were adopted marking the progress made in matters uponwhich agreement was not yet sufficiently complete to make conventionspracticable.The delegates of the United States were instructed to favor anagreement for obligatory arbitration, the establishment of a permanentcourt of arbitration to proceed judicially in the hearing and decisionof international causes, the prohibition of force for the collection ofcontract debts alleged to be due from governments to citizens of othercountries until after arbitration as to the justice and amount of thedebt and the time and manner of payment, the immunity of privateproperty at sea, the better definition of the rights of neutrals, and,in case any measure to that end should be introduced, the limitation ofarmaments.In the field of peaceful disposal of international differences severalimportant advances were made. First, as to obligatory arbitration.Although the Conference failed to secure a unanimous agreement upon thedetails of a convention for obligatory arbitration, it did resolve asfollows;"It is unanimous: (1) In accepting the principle for obligatoryarbitration; (2) In declaring that certain differences, and notablythose relating to the interpretation and application of internationalconventional stipulations are susceptible of being submitted toobligatory arbitration without any restriction."In view of the fact that as a result of the discussion the vote uponthe definite treaty of obligatory arbitration, which was proposed,stood 32 in favor to 9 against the adoption of the treaty, there can belittle doubt that the great majority of the countries of the world havereached a point where they are now ready to apply practically theprinciples thus unanimously agreed upon by the Conference.The second advance, and a very great one, is the agreement whichrelates to the use of force for the collection of contract debts. Yourattention is invited to the paragraphs upon this subject in my Messageof December, 1906, and to the resolution of the Third AmericanConference at Rio in the summer of 1906. The convention upon thissubject adopted by the Conference substantially as proposed by theAmerican delegates is as follows:"In order to avoid between nations armed conflicts of a purelypecuniary origin arising from contractual debts claimed of thegovernment of one country by the government of another country to bedue to its nationals, the signatory Powers agree not to have recourseto armed force for the collection of such contractual debts."However, this stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtorState refuses or leaves unanswered an offer to arbitrate, or, in caseof acceptance, makes it impossible to formulate the terms ofsubmission, or, after arbitration, fails to comply with the awardrendered."It is further agreed that arbitration here contemplated shall be inconformity, as to procedure, with Chapter III of the Convention for thePacific Settlement of International Disputes adopted at The Hague, andthat it shall determine, in so far as there shall be no agreementbetween the parties, the justice and the amount of the debt, the timeand mode of payment thereof."Such a provision would have prevented much injustice and extortion inthe past, and I cannot doubt that its effect in the future will be mostsalutary.A third advance has been made in amending and perfecting the conventionof 1899 for the voluntary settlement of international disputes, andparticularly the extension of those parts of that convention whichrelate to commissions of inquiry. The existence of those provisionsenabled the Governments of Great Britain and Russia to avoid war,notwithstanding great public excitement, at the time of the Dogger Bankincident, and the new convention agreed upon by the Conference givespractical effect to the experience gained in that inquiry.Substantial progress was also made towards the creation of a permanentjudicial tribunal for the determination of international causes. Therewas very full discussion of the proposal for such a court and a generalagreement was finally reached in favor of its creation. The Conferencerecommended to the signatory Powers the adoption of a draft upon whichit agreed for the organization of the court, leaving to be determinedonly the method by which the judges should be selected. This remainingunsettled question is plainly one which time and good temper willsolve.A further agreement of the first importance was that for the creationof an international prize court. The constitution, organization andprocedure of such a tribunal were provided for in detail. Anyone whorecalls the injustices under which this country suffered as a neutralpower during the early part of the last century can not fail to see inthis provision for an international prize court the great advance whichthe world is making towards the substitution of the rule of reason andjustice in place of simple force. Not only will the international prizecourt be the means of protecting the interests of neutrals, but it isin itself a step towards the creation of the more general court for thehearing of international controversies to which reference has just beenmade. The organization and action of such a prize court can not fail toaccustom the different countries to the submission of internationalquestions to the decision of an international tribunal, and we mayconfidently expect the results of such submission to bring about ageneral agreement upon the enlargement of the practice.Numerous provisions were adopted for reducing the evil effects of warand for defining the rights and duties of neutrals.The Conference also provided for the holding of a third Conferencewithin a period similar to that which elapsed between the First andSecond Conferences.The delegates of the United States worthily represented the spirit ofthe American people and maintained with fidelity and ability the policyof our Government upon all the great questions discussed in theConference.The report of the delegation, together with authenticated copies of theconventions signed, when received, will be laid before the Senate forits consideration.When we remember how difficult it is for one of our own legislativebodies, composed of citizens of the same country, speaking the samelanguage, living under the same laws, and having the same customs, toreach an agreement, or even to secure a majority upon any difficult andimportant subject which is proposed for legislation, it becomes plainthat the representatives of forty five different countries, speakingmany different languages, accustomed to different methods of procedure,with widely diverse interests, who discussed so many different subjectsand reached agreements upon so many, are entitled to gratefulappreciation for the wisdom, patience, and moderation with which theyhave discharged their duty. The example of this temperate discussion,and the agreements and the efforts to agree, among representatives ofall the nations of the earth, acting with universal recognition of thesupreme obligation to promote peace, can not fail to be a powerfulinfluence for good in future international relations.A year ago in consequence of a revolutionary movement in Cuba whichthreatened the immediate return to chaos of the island, the UnitedStates intervened, sending down an army and establishing a provisionalgovernment under Governor Magoon. Absolute quiet and prosperity havereturned to the island because of this action. We are now taking stepsto provide for elections in the island and our expectation is withinthe coming year to be able to turn the island over again to governmentchosen by the people thereof. Cuba is at our doors. It is not possiblethat this Nation should permit Cuba again to sink into the conditionfrom which we rescued it. All that we ask of the Cuban people is thatthey be prosperous, that they govern themselves so as to bring content,order and progress to their island, the Queen of the Antilles; and ouronly interference has been and will be to help them achieve theseresults.An invitation has been extended by Japan to the Government and peopleof the United States to participate in a great national exposition tobe held at Tokyo from April 1 to October 31, 1912, and in which theprincipal countries of the world are to be invited to take part. Thisis an occasion of special interest to all the nations of the world, andpeculiarly so to us; for it is the first instance in which such a greatnational exposition has been held by a great power dwelling on thePacific; and all the nations of Europe and America will, I trust, joinin helping to success this first great exposition ever held by a greatnation of Asia. The geographical relations of Japan and the UnitedStates as the possessors of such large portions of the coasts of thePacific, the intimate trade relations already existing between the twocountries, the warm friendship which has been maintained between themwithout break since the opening of Japan to intercourse with thewestern nations, and her increasing wealth and production, which weregard with hearty goodwill and wish to make the occasion of mutuallybeneficial commerce, all unite in making it eminently desirable thatthis invitation should be accepted. I heartily recommend suchlegislation as will provide in generous fashion for the representationof this Government and its people in the proposed exposition. Actionshould be taken now. We are apt to underestimate the time necessary forpreparation in such cases. The invitation to the French Exposition of1900 was brought to the attention of the Congress by PresidentCleveland in December, 1895; and so many are the delays necessary tosuch proceedings that the period of font years and a half which thenintervened before the exposition proved none too long for the properpreparation of the exhibits.The adoption of a new tariff by Germany, accompanied by conventions forreciprocal tariff concessions between that country and most of theother countries of continental Europe, led the German Government togive the notice necessary to terminate the reciprocal commercialagreement with this country proclaimed July 13, 1900. The notice was totake effect on the 1st of March, 1906, and in default of some otherarrangements this would have left the exports from the United States toGermany subject to the general German tariff duties, from 25 to 50 percent higher than the conventional duties imposed upon the goods of mostof our competitors for German trade.Under a special agreement made between the two Governments in February,1906, the German Government postponed the operation of their noticeuntil the 30th of June, 1907. In the meantime, deeming it to be my dutyto make every possible effort to prevent a tariff war between theUnited States and Germany arising from misunderstanding by eithercountry of the conditions existing in the other, and acting upon theinvitation of the German Government, I sent to Berlin a commissioncomposed of competent experts in the operation and administration ofthe customs tariff, from the Departments of the Treasury and Commerceand Labor. This commission was engaged for several mouths in conferencewith a similar commission appointed by the German Government, underinstructions, so far as practicable, to reach a common understanding asto all the facts regarding the tariffs of the United States and Germanymaterial and relevant to the trade relations between the two countries.The commission reported, and upon the basis of the report, a furthertemporary commercial agreement was entered into by the two countries,pursuant to which, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon thePresident by the third section of the tariff act of July 24, 1897, Iextended the reduced tariff rates provided for in that section tochampagne and all other sparkling wines, and pursuant to which theGerman conventional or minimum tariff rates were extended to about 961/2 per cent of all the exports from the United States to Germany. Thisagreement is to remain in force until the 30th of June, 1908, and untilsix months after notice by either party to terminate it.The agreement and the report of the commission on which it is basedwill be laid before the Congress for its information.This careful examination into the tariff relations between the UnitedStates and Germany involved an inquiry into certain of our methods ofadministration which had been the cause of much complaint on the partof German exporters. In this inquiry I became satisfied that certainvicious and unjustifiable practices had grown up in our customsadministration, notably the practice of determining values of importsupon detective reports never disclosed to the persons whose interestswere affected. The use of detectives, though often necessary, tendstowards abuse, and should be carefully guarded. Under our practice as Ifound it to exist in this case, the abuse had become gross anddiscreditable. Under it, instead of seeking information as to themarket value of merchandise from the well known and respected membersof the commercial community in the country of its production, secretstatements were obtained from informers and discharged employees andbusiness rivals, and upon this kind of secret evidence the values ofimported goods were frequently raised and heavy penalties werefrequently imposed upon importers who were never permitted to know whatthe evidence was and who never had an opportunity to meet it. It isquite probable that this system tended towards an increase of theduties collected upon imported goods, but I conceive it to be aviolation of law to exact more duties than the law provides, just as itis a violation to admit goods upon the payment of less than the legalrate of duty. This practice was repugnant to the spirit of American lawand to American sense of justice. In the judgment of the most competentexperts of the Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce andLabor it was wholly unnecessary for the due collection of the customsrevenues, and the attempt to defend it merely illustrates thedemoralization which naturally follows from a long continued course ofreliance upon such methods. I accordingly caused the regulationsgoverning this branch of the customs service to be modified so thatvalues are determined upon a hearing in which all the partiesinterested have an opportunity to be heard and to know the evidenceagainst them. Moreover our Treasury agents are accredited to thegovernment of the country in which they seek information, and inGermany receive the assistance of the quasi official chambers ofcommerce in determining the actual market value of goods, in accordancewith what I am advised to be the true construction of the law.These changes of regulations were adapted to the removal of suchmanifest abuses that I have not felt that they ought to be confined toour relations with Germany; and I have extended their operation to allother countries which have expressed a desire to enter into similaradministrative relations.I ask for authority to reform the agreement with China under which theindemnity of 1900 was fixed, by remitting and cancelling the obligationof China for the payment of all that part of the stipulated indemnitywhich is in excess of the sum of eleven million, six hundred andfifty five thousand, four hundred and ninety two dollars and sixty ninecents, and interest at four per cent. After the rescue of the foreignlegations in Peking during the Boxer troubles in 1900 the Powersrequired from China the payment of equitable indemnities to the severalnations, and the final protocol under which the troops were withdrawn,signed at Peking, September 7, 1901, fixed the amount of this indemnityallotted to the United States at over $20,000,000, and China paid, upto and including the 1st day of June last, a little over $6,000,000. Itwas the first intention of this Government at the proper time, when allclaims had been presented and all expenses ascertained as fully aspossible, to revise the estimates and account, and as a proof ofsincere friendship for China voluntarily to release that country fromits legal liability for all payments in excess of the sum which shouldprove to be necessary for actual indemnity to the United States and itscitizens.This Nation should help in every practicable way in the education ofthe Chinese people, so that the vast and populous Empire of China maygradually adapt itself to modern conditions. One way of doing this isby promoting the coming of Chinese students to this country and makingit attractive to them to take courses at our universities and highereducational institutions. Our educators should, so far as possible,take concerted action toward this end.On the courteous invitation of the President of Mexico, the Secretaryof State visited that country in September and October and was receivedeverywhere with the greatest kindness and hospitality.He carried from the Government of the United States to our southernneighbor a message of respect and good will and of desire for betteracquaintance and increasing friendship. The response from theGovernment and the people of Mexico was hearty and sincere. No painswere spared to manifest the most friendly attitude and feeling towardthe United States.In view of the close neighborhood of the two countries the relationswhich exist between Mexico and the United States are just cause forgratification. We have a common boundary of over 1,500 miles from theGulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Much of it is marked only by theshifting waters of the Rio Grande. Many thousands of Mexicans areresiding upon our side of the line and it is estimated that over 40,000Americans are resident in Mexican territory and that Americaninvestments in Mexico amount to over seven hundred million dollars. Theextraordinary industrial and commercial prosperity of Mexico has beengreatly promoted by American enterprise, and Americans are sharinglargely in its results. The foreign trade of the Republic alreadyexceeds $240,000,000 per annum, and of this two thirds both of exportsand imports are exchanged with the United States. Under thesecircumstances numerous questions necessarily arise between the twocountries. These questions are always approached and disposed of in aspirit of mutual courtesy and fair dealing. Americans carrying onbusiness in Mexico testify uniformly to the kindness and considerationwith which they are treated and their sense of the security of theirproperty and enterprises under the wise administration of the greatstatesman who has so long held the office of Chief Magistrate of thatRepublic.The two Governments have been uniting their efforts for a considerabletime past to aid Central America in attaining the degree of peace andorder which have made possible the prosperity of the northern ports ofthe Continent. After the peace between Guatemala, Honduras, andSalvador, celebrated under the circumstances described in my lastMessage, a new war broke out between the Republics of Nicaragua,Honduras, and Salvador. The effort to compose this new difficulty hasresulted in the acceptance of the joint suggestion of the Presidents ofMexico and of the United States for a general peace conference betweenall the countries of Central America. On the 17th day of September lasta protocol was signed between the representatives of the five CentralAmerican countries accredited to this Government agreeing upon aconference to be held in the City of Washington "in order to devise themeans of preserving the good relations among said Republics andbringing about permanent peace in those countries." The protocolincludes the expression of a wish that the Presidents of the UnitedStates and Mexico should appoint "representatives to lend their goodand impartial offices in a purely friendly way toward the realizationof the objects of the conference." The conference is now in session andwill have our best wishes and, where it is practicable, our friendlyassistance.One of the results of the Pan American Conference at Rio Janeiro in thesummer of 1906 has been a great increase in the activity and usefulnessof the International Bureau of American Republics. That institution,which includes all the American Republics in its membership and bringsall their representatives together, is doing a really valuable work ininforming the people of the United States about the other Republics andin making the United States known to them. Its action is now limited byappropriations determined when it was doing a work on a much smallerscale and rendering much less valuable service. I recommend that thecontribution of this Government to the expenses of the Bureau be madecommensurate with its increased work.
Theodore Roosevelt
To the Senate and House of Representatives:FINANCES.The financial standing of the Nation at the present time is excellent,and the financial management of the Nation\'s interests by theGovernment during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactoryresults. But our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly tobe hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose athoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects.During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there wasan increase in the amount of money in circulation of $902,991,399. Theincrease in the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within thistime there were several occasions when it was necessary for theTreasury Department to come to the relief of the money market bypurchases or redemptions of United States bonds; by increasing depositsin national banks; by stimulating additional issues of national banknotes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Ourimperfect currency system has made these proceedings necessary, andthey were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. Bythe middle of November the available working balance in the Treasuryhad been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing houseassociations throughout the country had been obliged to resort to theexpedient of issuing clearing house certificates, to be used as money.In this emergency it was determined to invite subscriptions for$50,000,000 Panama Canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per centcertificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13, 1898. Itwas proposed to re deposit in the national banks the proceeds of theseissues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulatingnotes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was sogreat that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the PanamaCanal bonds and $15,436,500 of the certificates of indebtedness.During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balancebetween the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of theGovernment showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906 and1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional partof the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of$99,283,413.54. The financial operations of the Government during thisperiod, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures,resulted in a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the UnitedStates from $987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding that therehad been two sales of Panama Canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to$54,631,980, and an issue of three per cent certificates ofindebtedness under the act of June 13, 1998, amounting to $15,436,500.Refunding operations of the Treasury Department under the act of March14, 1900, resulted in the conversion into two per cent consols of 1930of $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of interest. A decrease of$8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted from theseoperations.In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a netsurplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, areduction of the interest bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite ofthe extraordinary expense of the Panama Canal, and a saving of nearlynine millions on the annual interest charge. This is an exceedinglysatisfactory showing, especially in view of the fact that during thisperiod the Nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure thatit regarded as necessary. There have been no new taxes and no increaseof taxes; on the contrary, some taxes have been taken off; there hasbeen a reduction of taxation.CORPORATIONS.As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, andespecially the railroad, I can only repeat what I have already againand again said in my messages to the Congress, I believe that under theinterstate clause of the Constitution the United States has completeand paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, andI believe that the National Government alone can exercise this rightwith wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and todo justice to, the great corporations which are the most importantfactors in modern business. I believe that it is worse than folly toattempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Shermananti trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly andunequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. Istrongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit allcombinations there shall be substituted a law which shall expresslypermit combinations which are in the interest of the public, but shallat the same time give to some agency of the National Government fullpower of control and supervision over them. One of the chief featuresof this control should be securing entire publicity in all matterswhich the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, notby judicial but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to everyform of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing.The railways of the country should be put completely under theInterstate Commerce Commission and removed from the domain of theanti trust law. The power of the Commission should be madethoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision andcontrol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising andlowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should besummary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accountsof the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recentlegislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements shouldbe explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of theCommission being first gained and the combination or agreement beingpublished in all its details. In the interest of the public therepresentatives of the public should have complete power to see thatthe railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of coursethis power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice isdone to the railroads. The shareholders, the employees and the shippersall have interests that must be guarded. It is to the interest of allof them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and thatthere should be no improper issuance of securities. The guidingintelligences necessary for the successful building and successfulmanagement of railroads should receive ample remuneration; but no manshould be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out offraudulent over capitalization and kindred stock gambling performances;there must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of the farmers andbusiness men who ship freight, or callous disregard of the rights andneeds of the employees. In addition to this the interests of theshareholders, of the employees, and of the shippers should all beguarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue andimproper consideration is to do injustice to the others. Rates must bemade as low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all theemployees of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and properreturns to the shareholders; but they must not, for instance, bereduced in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of theemployees or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits ofhonest shareholders.Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in interstate business shouldbe put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.It is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through theirrepresentatives, should act in this matter. It is hard to say whethermost damage to the country at large would come from entire failure onthe part of the public to supervise and control the actions of thegreat corporations, or from the exercise of the necessary governmentalpower in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations.Both the preachers of an unrestricted individualism, and the preachersof an oppression which would deny to able men of business the justreward of their initiative and business sagacity, are advocatingpolicies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the wholecountry. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law defyingcorporation, to take any action, no matter how iniquitous, in theeffort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege, would beruinous to the Republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort tosecure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing.On the other hand, to attack these wrongs in that spirit of demagogywhich can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth, and isdumb and blind in the presence of wrong committed against men ofproperty or by men of no property, is exactly as evil as corruptly todefend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be wagedagainst misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever it is found; and wemust stand heartily for the rights of every decent man, whether he be aman of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wage workeror a tiller of the soil.It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium putupon individual initiative and individual capacity, and an ample rewardfor the great directing intelligences alone competent to manage thegreat business operations of to day. It is well to keep in mind thatexactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and thereactionary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rightsof property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, andthe men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from thedemagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to andoppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success ofeither type of wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction againstthe cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to theNation there is nothing to choose between on the one hand thecorruptionist, the bribe giver, the bribe taker, the man who employshis great talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a large scale, and,on the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whetherfrom ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to hisambition, persuades well meaning but wrong headed men to try to destroythe instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each groupof men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that groupis itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in aspirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold toaccount under the law the wealthy men who in their management of greatcorporations, whether railroads, street railways, or other industrialenterprises, have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of theplain, decent people. Such an attitude can not be condemned tooseverely, for men of property should recognize that they jeopardize therights of property when they fail heartily to join in the effort to doaway with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocateproper control on behalf of the public, through the State, of thesegreat corporations, and of the wealth engaged on a giant scale inbusiness operations, must ever keep in mind that unless they doscrupulous justice to the corporation, unless they permit ample profit,and cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they actwith honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well being;for in the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, thepeople as a whole would probably go back to the reign of anunrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the Stateso drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonableand narrow hostility to wealth, as to prevent business operations frombeing profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire businesscommunity, and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens.The opposition to Government control of these great corporations makesits most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrineof State\'s rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believein unrestricted individualism in business, just as there were formerlymany sincere men who believed in slavery that is, in the unrestrictedright of an individual to own another individual. These men do not bythemselves have great weight, however. The effective fight againstadequate Government control and supervision of individual, andespecially of corporate, wealth engaged in interstate business ischiefly done under cover; and especially under cover of an appeal toState\'s rights. It is not at all infrequent to read in the same speecha denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege anddefiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and adenunciation of centralization in the Central Government of the powerto deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course thepolicy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to absolutelynothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. The chiefreason, among the many sound and compelling reasons, that led to theformation of the National Government was the absolute need that theUnion, and not the several States, should deal with interstate andforeign commerce; and the power to deal with interstate commerce wasgranted absolutely and plenarily to the Central Government and wasexercised completely as regards the only instruments of interstatecommerce known in those days the waterways, the highroads, as well asthe partnerships of individuals who then conducted all of what businessthere was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads;and the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnershipsor individuals. The proposal to make the National Government supremeover, and therefore to give it complete control over, the railroads andother instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carryout to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose,for which the Constitution was rounded. It does not representcentralization. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patentfact that centralization has already come in business. If thisirresponsible outside business power is to be controlled in theinterest of the general public it can only be controlled in one way bygiving adequate power of control to the one sovereignty capable ofexercising such power the National Government. Forty or fifty separatestate governments can not exercise that power over corporations doingbusiness in most or all of them; first, because they absolutely lackthe authority to deal with interstate business in any form; and second,because of the inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in theeffort to enforce different kinds of state regulation, ofteninconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves.Such divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom andeffect. The Central Government is the only power which, withoutoppression, can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control andsupervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for Nationalcontrol means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet torender likely continual bursts of action by State legislatures, whichcan not achieve the purpose sought for, but which can do a great dealof damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on thepublic.I believe that the more farsighted corporations are themselves comingto recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayedduring the last few years to regulation and control by the NationalGovernment of combinations engaged in interstate business. The truth isthat we who believe in this movement of asserting and exercising agenuine control, in the public interest, over these great corporationshave to contend against two sets of enemies, who, though nominallyopposed to one another, are really allies in preventing a propersolution of the problem. There are, first, the big corporation men, andthe extreme individualists among business men, who genuinely believe inutterly unregulated business that is, in the reign of plutocracy; and,second, the men who, being blind to the economic movements of the day,believe in a movement of repression rather than of regulation ofcorporations, and who denounce both the power of the railroads and theexercise of the Federal power which alone can really control therailroads. Those who believe in efficient national control, on theother hand, do not in the least object to combinations; do not in theleast object to concentration in business administration. On thecontrary, they favor both, with the all important proviso that thereshall be such publicity about their workings, and such thoroughgoingcontrol over them, as to insure their being in the interest, and notagainst the interest, of the general public. We do not object to theconcentration of wealth and administration; but we do believe in thedistribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and insecuring to the public the full benefit of the concentratedadministration. We believe that with concentration in administrationthere can come both be advantage of a larger ownership and of a moreequitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a betterservice to the commonwealth. We believe that the administration shouldbe for the benefit of the many; and that greed and rascality, practicedon a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced ona small scale.We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by anyshort and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing variousconcurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domainof all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the FederalGovernment. But there is legislation which the Federal Government alonecan enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure theattainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should beregulation by the National Government of the great interstatecorporations, including a simple method of account keeping, publicity,supervision of the issue securities, abolition of rebates, and ofspecial privileges. There should be short time franchises for allcorporations engaged in public business; including the corporationswhich get power from water rights. There should be National as well asState guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legislationhereinafter referred to should concurrently be enacted into law.To accomplish this, means of course a certain increase in the useof not the creation of power, by the Central Government. The poweralready exists; it does not have to be created; the only question iswhether it shall be used or left idle and meanwhile the corporationsover which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. Letthose who object to this increase in the use of the only poweravailable, the national power, be frank, and admit openly that theypropose to abandon any effort to control the great businesscorporations and to exercise supervision over the accumulation anddistribution of wealth; for such supervision and control can only comethrough this particular kind of increase of power. We no more believein that empiricism which demand, absolutely unrestrained individualismthan we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialismwhich would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin thecountry with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualismitself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in theleast in the concentration of administrative power in responsible andaccountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficientlyconcentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people forits use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easilyreached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through manyadministrators, many legislators, many men who work behind and throughlegislators and administrators, is impalpable, is unseen, isirresponsible, can not be reached, can not be held to account.Democracy is in peril wherever the administration of political power isscattered among a variety of men who work in secret, whose very namesare unknown to the common people. It is not in peril from any man whoderives authority from the people, who exercises it in sight of thepeople, and who is from time to time compelled to give an account ofits exercise to the people.LABOR.There are many matters affecting labor and the status of thewage worker to which I should like to draw your attention, but anexhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not nownecessary. This administration is nearing its end; and, moreover, underour form of government the solution of the problem depends upon theaction of the States as much as upon the action of the Nation.Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to setbefore you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep themin mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reformof abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrialconditions represents not true conservatism, but an incitement to thewildest radicalism; for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go handin hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no changeis made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, orperhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in manydifferent directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under whichthe men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, thesuperintendents, the men who produce for the market and the men whofind a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater sharethan at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to invest itin the tools and instruments by which all work is carried on. As far aspossible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferredby machinery, organization, and division of labor, accompanied by aneffort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage worker ofrailway, mill and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wishto see the farmer own his own land; we do not wish to see the farms solarge that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm themby tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a Europeanpeasant. Again, the depositors in our savings banks now number overone tenth of our entire population. These are all capitalists, whothrough the savings banks loan their money to the workers that is, inmany cases to themselves to carry on their various industries. Themore we increase their number, the more we introduce the principles ofcooperation into our industry. Every increase in the number of smallstockholders in corporations is a good thing, for the same reasons; andwhere the employees are the stockholders the result is particularlygood. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that canbe accomplished by legislation; but legislation can do a good deal.Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep theirsavings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highwaysmust be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice.Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer thanat present for the man of small means to invest his money in stocks.There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor,shortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should beprohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possible discouraged. Thereshould be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrialeducation should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lightenthe burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium uponthrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to bethe main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortunereaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any inheritancetax such as I propose. It is eminently right that the Nation should fixthe terms upon which the great fortunes are inherited. They rarely dogood and they often do harm to those who inherit them in theirentirety.PROTECTION FOR WAGEWORKERS.The above is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of thereforms for which we should work. But there is one matter with whichthe Congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be anypaltering with the question of taking care of the wage workers who,under our present industrial system, become killed, crippled, or wornout as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majorityof wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by State action;but the National Government should legislate in thoroughgoing andfar reaching fashion not only for all employees of the NationalGovernment, but for all persons engaged in interstate commerce. Theobject sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far asthose killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers\' liabilitylaws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call yourattention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old agepensions have been taken in many of our private industries. These maybe indefinitely extended through voluntary association and contributoryschemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the recentMassachusetts plan. To strengthen these practical measures should beour immediate duty; it is not at present necessary to consider thelarger and more general governmental schemes that most Europeangovernments have found themselves obliged to adopt.Our present system, or rather no system, works dreadful wrong, and isof benefit to only one class of people the lawyers. When a workman isinjured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but thecertainty of relief through immediate administrative action. The numberof accidents which result in the death or crippling of wageworkers, inthe Union at large, is simply appalling; in a very few years it runs upa total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in anymodern war. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or"constitutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to interferewith this and similar movements. Progress in civilization haseverywhere meant a limitation and regulation of contract. I call yourespecial attention to the bulletin of the Bureau of Labor which gives astatement of the methods of treating the unemployed in Europeancountries, as this is a subject which in Germany, for instance, istreated in connection with making provision for worn out and crippledworkmen.Pending a thoroughgoing investigation and action there is certainlegislation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at thelast session of the Congress, granting compensation to certain classesof employees of the Government, should be extended to include allemployees of the Government and should be made more liberal in itsterms. There is no good ground for the distinction made in the lawbetween those engaged in hazardous occupations and those not soengaged. If a man is injured or killed in any line of work, it washazardous in his case. Whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of thosefollowing a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought notto have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensation. Itis a grim logic which says to an injured employee or to the dependentsof one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation becausevery few people other than he have been injured or killed in thatoccupation. Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law isthat it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may besacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States. The terms of theact providing compensation should be made more liberal than in thepresent act. A year\'s compensation is not adequate for a wage earner\'sfamily in the event of his death by accident in the course of hisemployment. And in the event of death occurring, say, ten or elevenmonths after the accident, the family would only receive ascompensation the equivalent of one or two months\' earnings. In thisrespect the generosity of the United States towards its employeescompares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe eventhe poorest.The terms of the act are also a hardship in prohibiting payment incases where the accident is in any way due to the negligence of theemployee. It is inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will leadmen to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well isthis recognized that in practically all countries in the civilizedworld, except the United States, only a great degree of negligence actsas a bar to securing compensation. Probably in no other respect is ourlegislation, both State and National, so far behind practically theentire civilized world as in the matter of liability and compensationfor accidents in industry. It is humiliating that at Europeaninternational congresses on accidents the United States should besingled out as the most belated among the nations in respect toemployers\' liability legislation. This Government is itself a largeemployer of labor, and in its dealings with its employees it should seta standard in this country which would place it on a par with the mostprogressive countries in Europe. The laws of the United States in thisrespect and the laws of European countries have been summarized in arecent Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, and no American who reads thissummary can fail to be struck by the great contrast between ourpractices and theirs a contrast not in any sense to our credit.The Congress should without further delay pass a model employers\'liability law for the District of Columbia. The employers\' liabilityact recently declared unconstitutional, on account of apparentlyincluding in its provisions employees engaged in intrastate commerce aswell as those engaged in interstate commerce, has been held by thelocal courts to be still in effect so far as its provisions apply toDistrict of Columbia. There should be no ambiguity on this point. Ifthere is any doubt on the subject, the law should be reenacted withspecial reference to the District of Columbia. This act, however,applies only to employees of common carriers. In all other occupationsthe liability law of the District is the old common law. The severityand injustice of the common law in this matter has been in some degreeor another modified in the majority of our States, and the onlyjurisdiction under the exclusive control of the Congress should beahead and not behind the States of the Union in this respect. Acomprehensive employers\' liability law should be passed for theDistrict of Columbia.I renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half holidaysbe granted during summer to all wageworkers in Government employ.I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight hour dayshould as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entirework being carried on by the Government; the present law should beamended to embrace contracts on those public works which the presentwording of the act seems to exclude.THE COURTS.I most earnestly urge upon the Congress the duty of increasing thetotally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole thereis no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whosemoneyed reward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning withthe Supreme Court, the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It isnot befitting the dignity of the Nation that its most honored publicservants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earnin private life that the performance of public service by them impliesan exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised fordoing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administrationof justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against persons ofsmall means, and favor only the very criminals whom it is mostdesirable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of casesmake in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised.Much of this intolerable delay is due to improper regard paid totechnicalities which are a mere hindrance to justice. In some notedrecent cases this over regard for technicalities has resulted in astriking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic.At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violentand sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary of the country, an attackcouched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest andbroad minded judges, no less than those of narrower mind and morerestricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted toprevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary,because it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desiredopportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judgeswho were unjustly assailed. Last year, before the House Committee onthe Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their demands,specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compromise,stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. Theyinsisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction shouldissue except to protect a property right, and specifically providedthat the right to carry on business should not be construed as aproperty right; and in a second provision their bill made legal in alabor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more personsthat would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In otherwords, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting in every form,legalizing, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott whichthe anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemned; whilethe right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from underthat protection which the law throws over property. The demand was madethat there should be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby mostseriously impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented acourse of policy which, if carried out, would mean the enthronement ofclass privilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and thedestruction of one of the most essential functions of the judiciary inall civilized lands.The violence of the crusade for this legislation, and its completefailure, illustrate two truths which it is essential our people shouldlearn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, thelaborer, the wageworker, that by demanding what is improper andimpossible he plays into the hands of his foes. Such a crude andvicious attack upon the courts, even if it were temporarily successful,would inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band thegreat mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all thejudges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheelsof justice stopped. A movement of this kind can ultimately result innothing but damage to those in whose behalf it is nominally undertaken.This is a most healthy truth, which it is wise for all our people tolearn. Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumesthe name of "class consciousness" is certain ultimately to fail, and ifit temporarily succeeds, to do far reaching damage. "Classconsciousness," where it is merely another name for the odious vice ofclass selfishness, is equally noxious whether in an employer\'sassociation or in a workingman\'s association. The movement in questionwas one in which the appeal was made to all workingmen to voteprimarily, not as American citizens, but as individuals of a certainclass in society. Such an appeal in the first place revolts the morehigh minded and far sighted among the persons to whom it is addressed,and in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among allother classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against thevery organization on whose behalf it is issued. The result is thereforeunfortunate from every standpoint. This healthy truth, by the way, willbe learned by the socialists if they ever succeed in establishing inthis country an important national party based on such classconsciousness and selfish class interest.The wageworkers, the workingmen, the laboring men of the country, bythe way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast theirvotes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphasized theirsound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to fellpride in this attitude of sturdy independence, in this uncompromisinginsistence upon acting simply as good citizens, as good Americans,without regard to fancied and improper class interests. Such anattitude is an object lesson in good citizenship to the entire nation.But the extreme reactionaries, the persons who blind themselves to thewrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring men, shouldalso think seriously as to what such a movement as this portends. Thejudges who have shown themselves able and willing effectively to checkthe dishonest activity of the very rich man who works iniquity by themismanagement of corporations, who have shown themselves alert to dojustice to the wageworker, and sympathetic with the needs of the massof our people, so that the dweller in the tenement houses, the man whopractices a dangerous trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hoursof labor, feel that their needs are understood by the courts thesejudges are the real bulwark of the courts; these judges, the judges ofthe stamp of the president elect, who have been fearless in opposinglabor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also in holding to strictaccount corporations that work iniquity, and far sighted in seeing thatthe workingman gets his rights, are the men of all others to whom weowe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation hasfallen on deaf ears, that the agitation for its passage proved to bewithout substantial basis. The courts are jeopardized primarily by theaction of those Federal and State judges who show inability orunwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of very rich men undermodern industrial conditions, and inability or unwillingness to giverelief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down bythese modern industrial conditions; who, in other words, fail tounderstand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced bythe new and highly complex social and industrial civilization which hasgrown up in the last half century.The rapid changes in our social and industrial life which have attendedthis rapid growth have made it necessary that, in applying to concretecases the great rule of right laid down in our Constitution, thereshould be a full understanding and appreciation of the new conditionsto which the rules are to be applied. What would have been aninfringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessarysafeguard of liberty to day. What would have been an injury to propertythen may be necessary to the enjoyment of property now. Every judicialdecision involves two terms one, as interpretation of the law; theother, the understanding of the facts to which it is to be applied. Thegreat mass of our judicial officers are, I believe, alive to thosechanges of conditions which so materially affect the performance oftheir judicial duties. Our judicial system is sound and effective atcore, and it remains, and must ever be maintained, as the safeguard ofthose principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundationof American institutions; for, as Burke finely said, when liberty andjustice are separated, neither is safe. There are, however, somemembers of the judicial body who have lagged behind in theirunderstanding of these great and vital changes in the body politic,whose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the oldprinciples made necessary by the new conditions. Judges of this stampdo lasting harm by their decisions, because they convince poor men inneed of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorantof and out of sympathy with their needs, and profoundly indifferent orhostile to any proposed remedy. To such men it seems a cruel mockery tohave any court decide against them on the ground that it desires topreserve "liberty" in a purely technical form, by withholding libertyin any real and constructive sense. It is desirable that thelegislative body should possess, and wherever necessary exercise, thepower to determine whether in a given case employers and employees arenot on an equal footing, so that the necessities of the latter compelthem to submit to such exactions as to hours and conditions of labor asunduly to tax their strength; and only mischief can result when suchdetermination is upset on the ground that there must be no"interference with the liberty to contract" often a merely academic"liberty," the exercise of which is the negation of real liberty.There are certain decisions by various courts which have beenexceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers. This is true ofall the decisions that decide that men and women are, by theConstitution, "guaranteed their liberty" to contract to enter adangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number ofhours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings; and therefore can notrecover damages when maimed in that occupation and can not be forbiddento work what the legislature decides is an excessive number of hours,or to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decidesto be unhealthy. The most dangerous occupations are often the poorestpaid and those where the hours of work are longest; and in many casesthose who go into them are driven by necessity so great that they havepractically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to abovenullify the legislative effort to protect the wage workers who mostneed protection from those employers who take advantage of theirgrinding need. They halt or hamper the movement for securing better andmore equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving to themisery hunted beings who make contracts for such service their"liberty" to make them, is either to speak in a spirit of heartlessirony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions oflife among the great masses of our fellow countrymen, a lack whichunfits a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executiveor legislative officer.There is also, I think, ground for the belief that substantialinjustice is often suffered by employees in consequence of the customof courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them, andpunishing them for contempt of court in instances where, as a matter offact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. Outside of organizedlabor there is a widespread feeling that this system often works greatinjustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their workingcondition result in industrial disputes. A temporary injunctionprocured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of apermanent injunction in causing disaster to the wageworkers\' side insuch a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraintwhich comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Itsdiscontent has been unwisely expressed, and often improperly expressed,but there is a sound basis for it, and the orderly and law abidingpeople of a community would be in a far stronger position for upholdingthe courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be providedagainst.Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the extremelabor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of themost offensive kind, and even if enacted into law I believe that thelaw would rightly be held unconstitutional. Moreover, the labor peopleare themselves now beginning to invoke the use of the power ofinjunction. During the last ten years, and within my own knowledge, atleast fifty injunctions have been obtained by labor unions in New YorkCity alone, most of them being to protect the union label (a "propertyright"), but some being obtained for other reasons against employers.The power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on noaccount be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against itsabuse. I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a yearago for checking the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunctionsshould be adopted. In substance, provision should be made that noinjunction or temporary restraining order issue otherwise than onnotice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result; and insuch case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within ashort fixed period, and, if not then continued after hearing, it shouldforthwith lapse. Decisions should be rendered immediately, and thechance of delay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that theprocedure should be sharply defined, and the judge required minutely tostate the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor,so that the Congress can, if it desires, examine and investigate thesame.The chief lawmakers in our country may be, and often are, the judges,because they are the final seat of authority. Every time they interpretcontract, property, vested rights, due process of law, liberty, theynecessarily enact into law parts of a system of social philosophy, andas such interpretation is fundamental, they give direction to alllaw making. The decisions of the courts on economic and socialquestions depend upon their economic and social philosophy; and for thepeaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shallowe most to those judges who hold to a twentieth century economic andsocial philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy, which wasitself the product of primitive economic conditions. Of course ajudge\'s views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second inimportance to his possession of a high and fine character; which meansthe possession of such elementary virtues as honesty, courage, andfair mindedness. The judge who owes his election to pandering todemagogic sentiments or class hatreds and prejudices, and the judge whoowes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favorof a great corporation, are alike unworthy to sit on the bench, arealike traitors to the people; and no profundity of legal learning, orcorrectness of abstract conviction on questions of public policy, canserve as an offset to such shortcomings. But it is also true thatjudges, like executives and legislators, should hold sound views on thequestions of public policy which are of vital interest to the people.The legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people inenacting and administering the laws. The judges are not chosen torepresent the people in this sense. Their function is to interpret thelaws. The legislators are responsible for the laws; the judges for thespirit in which they interpret and enforce the laws. We stand alooffrom the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant toolsof popular prejudice and passion; and we stand aloof from those equallyunwise partisans of reaction and privilege who deny the propositionthat, inasmuch as judges are chosen to serve the interests of the wholepeople, they should strive to find out what those interests are, and,so far as they conscientiously can, should strive to give effect topopular conviction when deliberately and duly expressed by thelawmaking body. The courts are to be highly commended and staunchlyupheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by amajority; but they are to be blamed when they fail to recognize under agovernment like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to amatter of legitimate policy, when duly expressed by the legislature.Such lawfully expressed and deliberate judgment should be given effectby the courts, save in the extreme and exceptional cases where therehas been a clear violation of a constitutional provision. Anything likefrivolity or wantonness in upsetting such clearly taken governmentalaction is a grave offense against the Republic. To protest againsttyranny, to protect minorities from oppression, to nullify an actcommitted in a spasm of popular fury, is to render a service to theRepublic. But for the courts to arrogate to themselves functions whichproperly belong to the legislative bodies is all wrong, and in the endworks mischief. The people should not be permitted to pardon evil andslipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right;they should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law is tohave the legislature repeal it, and not to have the courts by ingenioushair splitting nullify it. A law may be unwise and improper; but itshould not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strainedinterpretation, for the result of such action is to take away from thepeople at large their sense of responsibility and ultimately to destroytheir capacity for orderly self restraint and self government. Undersuch a popular government as ours, rounded on the theory that in thelong run the will of the people is supreme, the ultimate safety of theNation can only rest in training and guiding the people so that whatthey will shall be right, and not in devising means to defeat theirwill by the technicalities of strained construction.For many of the shortcomings of justice in our country our people as awhole are themselves to blame, and the judges and juries merely beartheir share together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable tous as a people that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers,or in bringing to justice men who as public servants have been guiltyof corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of publicservants. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due tohairsplitting technicalities in the interpretation of law by judges, tosentimentality and class consciousness on the part of juries, or tohysteria and sensationalism in the daily press. For much of thisfailure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such.We who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibilityfrom our own shoulders. But there is an important part of the failurewhich has specially to do with inability to hold to proper account menof wealth who behave badly.The chief breakdown is in dealing with the new relations that arisefrom the mutualism, the interdependence of our time. Every new socialrelation begets a new type of wrongdoing of sin, to use anold fashioned word and many years always elapse before society is ableto turn this sin into crime which can be effectively punished at law.During the lifetime of the older men now alive the social relationshave changed far more rapidly than in the preceding two centuries. Theimmense growth of corporations, of business done by associations, andthe extreme strain and pressure of modern life, have producedconditions which render the public confused as to who its reallydangerous foes are; and among the public servants who have not onlyshared this confusion, but by some of their acts have increased it, arecertain judges. Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing withcorporations and in re settling the proper attitude to be taken by thepublic not only towards corporations, but towards labor and towards thesocial questions arising out of the factory system and the enormousgrowth of our great cities.The huge wealth that has been accumulated by a few individuals ofrecent years, in what has amounted to a social and industrialrevolution, has been as regards some of these individuals made possibleonly by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type ofmodern corporation, with its officers and agents, its many issues ofsecurities, and its constant consolidation with allied undertakings,finally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater numberof elements that, under various judicial decisions, lend themselves tofraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the human brain.Corporations are necessary instruments of modern business. They havebeen permitted to become a menace largely because the governmentalrepresentatives of the people have worked slowly in providing foradequate control over them.The chief offender in any given case may be an executive, alegislature, or a judge. Every executive head who advises violent,instead of gradual, action, or who advocates ill considered andsweeping measures of reform (especially if they are tainted withvindictiveness and disregard for the rights of the minority) isparticularly blameworthy. The several legislatures are responsible forthe fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lackof consideration. Moreover, they are often prepared, and still morefrequently amended during passage, at the suggestion of the veryparties against whom they are afterwards enforced. Our great clustersof corporations, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multi millionaires,employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws in thesestatutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secretagents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostilelegislation innocuous by making it unconstitutional, often through theinsertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweepingprovisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them; whilethe demagogues, the corrupt creatures who introduce blackmailingschemes to "strike" corporations, and all who demand extreme, andundesirably radical, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemiesof the very public whose loud mouthed champions they profess to be. Avery striking illustration of the consequences of carelessness in thepreparation of a statute was the employers\' liability law of 1906. Inthe cases arising under that law, four out of six courts of firstinstance held it unconstitutional; six out of nine justices of theSupreme Court held that its subject matter was within the province ofcongressional action; and four of the nine justices held it valid. Itwas, however, adjudged unconstitutional by a bare majority of thecourt five to four. It was surely a very slovenly piece of work toframe the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open atall.Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflictinginterpretations of the interstate commerce law. Control over the greatcorporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it isvested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of theFederal executive, carrying out a Federal law; it can never beeffective if a divided responsibility is left in both the States andthe Nation; it can never be effective if left in the hands of thecourts to be decided by lawsuits.The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under ourform of government. Respect for the law is essential to the permanenceof our institutions; and respect for the law is largely conditionedupon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the Republic tosay anything which can weaken this respect, save for the gravest reasonand in the most carefully guarded manner. Our judges should be held inpeculiar honor; and the duty of respectful and truthful comment andcriticism, which should be binding when we speak of anybody, should beespecially binding when we speak of them. On an average they standabove any other servants of the community, and the greatest judges havereached the high level held by those few greatest patriots whom thewhole country delights to honor. But we must face the fact that thereare wise and unwise judges, just as there are wise and unwiseexecutives and legislators. When a president or a governor behavesimproperly or unwisely, the remedy is easy, for his term is short; thesame is true with the legislator, although not to the same degree, forhe is one of many who belong to some given legislative body, and it istherefore less easy to fix his personal responsibility and hold himaccountable therefor. With a judge, who, being human, is also likely toerr, but whose tenure is for life, there is no similar way of holdinghim to responsibility. Under ordinary conditions the only forms ofpressure to which he is in any way amenable are public opinion and theaction of his fellow judges. It is the last which is most immediatelyeffective, and to which we should look for the reform of abuses. Anyremedy applied from without is fraught with risk. It is far better,from every standpoint, that the remedy should come from within. In noother nation in the world do the courts wield such vast andfar reaching power as in the United States. All that is necessary isthat the courts as a whole should exercise this power with thefarsighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the futurewhile they act in the present. Let them exercise this great power notonly honestly and bravely, but with wise insight into the needs andfixed purposes of the people, so that they may do justice and workequity, so that they may protect all persons in their rights, and yetbreak down the barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right.FORESTS.If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to ourchildren and our children\'s children to perform at once, it is to savethe forests of this country, for they constitute the first and mostimportant element in the conservation of the natural resources of thecountry. There are of course two kinds of natural resources, One is thekind which can only be used as part of a process of exhaustion; this istrue of mines, natural oil and gas wells, and the like. The other, andof course ultimately by far the most important, includes the resourceswhich can be improved in the process of wise use; the soil, the rivers,and the forests come under this head. Any really civilized nation willso use all of these three great national assets that the nation willhave their benefit in the future. Just as a farmer, after all his lifemaking his living from his farm, will, if he is an expert farmer, leaveit as an asset of increased value to his son, so we should leave ournational domain to our children, increased in value and not worn out.There are small sections of our own country, in the East and the West,in the Adriondacks, the White Mountains, and the Appalachians, and inthe Rocky Mountains, where we can already see for ourselves the damagein the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river systemswhich comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether thisdeforestation is due to the actual reckless cutting of timber, to thefires that inevitably follow such reckless cutting of timber, or toreckless and uncontrolled grazing, especially by the great migratorybands of sheep, the unchecked wandering of which over the country meansdestruction to forests and disaster to the small home makers, thesettlers of limited means.Shortsighted persons, or persons blinded to the future by desire tomake money in every way out of the present, sometimes speak as if nogreat damage would be done by the reckless destruction of our forests.It is difficult to have patience with the arguments of these persons.Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, wehave already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, andno measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo themischief that has already been done. But we can prevent furthermischief being done; and it would be in the highest degreereprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience ortemporary cost interfere with such action, especially as regards theNational Forests which the nation can now, at this very moment,control.All serious students of the question are aware of the great damage thathas been done in the Mediterranean countries of Europe, Asia, andAfrica by deforestation. The similar damage that has been done inEastern Asia is less well known. A recent investigation into conditionsin North China by Mr. Frank N. Meyer, of the Bureau of Plant Industryof the United States Department of Agriculture, has incidentallyfurnished in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that comes fromreckless deforestation of mountains, and of the further fact that thedamage once done may prove practically irreparable. So important arethese investigations that I herewith attach as an appendix to mymessage certain photographs showing present conditions in China. Theyshow in vivid fashion the appalling desolation, taking the shape ofbarren mountains and gravel and sand covered plains, which immediatelyfollows and depends upon the deforestation of the mountains. Not manycenturies ago the country of northern China was one of the most fertileand beautiful spots in the entire world, and was heavily forested. Weknow this not only from the old Chinese records, but from the accountsgiven by the traveler, Marco Polo. He, for instance, mentions that invisiting the provinces of Shansi and Shensi he observed manyplantations of mulberry trees. Now there is hardly a single mulberrytree in either of these provinces, and the culture of the silkworm hasmoved farther south, to regions of atmospheric moisture. As anillustration of the complete change in the rivers, we may take Polo\'sstatement that a certain river, the Hun Ho, was so large and deep thatmerchants ascended it from the sea with heavily laden boats; today thisriver is simply a broad sandy bed, with shallow, rapid currentswandering hither and thither across it, absolutely unnavigable. But wedo not have to depend upon written records. The dry wells, and thewells with water far below the former watermark, bear testimony to thegood days of the past and the evil days of the present. Wherever thenative vegetation has been allowed to remain, as, for instance, hereand there around a sacred temple or imperial burying ground, there arestill huge trees and tangled jungle, fragments of the glorious ancientforests. The thick, matted forest growth formerly covered the mountainsto their summits. All natural factors favored this dense forest growth,and as long as it was permitted to exist the plains at the foot of themountains were among the most fertile on the globe, and the wholecountry was a garden. Not the slightest effort was made, however, toprevent the unchecked cutting of the trees, or to secure reforestation.Doubtless for many centuries the tree cutting by the inhabitants of themountains worked but slowly in bringing about the changes that have nowcome to pass; doubtless for generations the inroads were scarcelynoticeable. But there came a time when the forest had shrunksufficiently to make each year\'s cutting a serious matter, and fromthat time on the destruction proceeded with appalling rapidity; for ofcourse each year of destruction rendered the forest less able torecuperate, less able to resist next year\'s inroad. Mr. Meyer describesthe ceaseless progress of the destruction even now, when there is solittle left to destroy. Every morning men and boys go out armed withmattox or axe, scale the steepest mountain sides, and cut down and grubout, root and branch, the small trees and shrubs still to be found. Thebig trees disappeared centuries ago, so that now one of these is neverseen save in the neighborhood of temples, where they are artificiallyprotected; and even here it takes all the watch and care of thetree loving priests to prevent their destruction. Each family, eachcommunity, where there is no common care exercised in the interest ofall of them to prevent deforestation, finds its profit in the immediateuse of the fuel which would otherwise be used by some other family orsome other community. In the total absence of regulation of the matterin the interest of the whole people, each small group is inevitablypushed into a policy of destruction which can not afford to takethought for the morrow. This is just one of those matters which it isfatal to leave to unsupervised individual control. The forest can onlybe protected by the State, by the Nation; and the liberty of action ofindividuals must be conditioned upon what the State or Nationdetermines to be necessary for the common safety.The lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind shouldhave learned many times already from what has occurred in other places.Denudation leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare rock;and meanwhile the rock waste buries the bottomlands. When the soil isgone, men must go; and the process does not take long.This ruthless destruction of the forests in northern China has broughtabout, or has aided in bringing about, desolation, just as thedestruction of the forests in central Asia aid in bringing ruin to theonce rich central Asian cities; just as the destruction of the forestin northern Africa helped towards the ruin of a region that was afertile granary in Roman days. Shortsighted man, whether barbaric,semi civilized, or what he mistakenly regards as fully civilized, whenhe has destroyed the forests, has rendered certain the ultimatedestruction of the land itself. In northern China the mountains are nowsuch as are shown by the accompanying photographs, absolutely barrenpeaks. Not only have the forests been destroyed, but because of theirdestruction the soil has been washed off the naked rock. The terribleconsequence is that it is impossible now to undo the damage that hasbeen done. Many centuries would have to pass before soil would againcollect, or could be made to collect, in sufficient quantity once moreto support the old time forest growth. In consequence the Mongol Desertis practically extending eastward over northern China. The climate haschanged and is still changing. It has changed even within the last halfcentury, as the work of tree destruction has been consummated. Thegreat masses of arboreal vegetation on the mountains formerly absorbedthe heat of the sun and sent up currents of cool air which brought themoisture laden clouds lower and forced them to precipitate in rain apart of their burden of water. Now that there is no vegetation, thebarren mountains, scorched by the sun, send up currents of heated airwhich drive away instead of attracting the rain clouds, and cause theirmoisture to be disseminated. In consequence, instead of the regular andplentiful rains which existed in these regions of China when theforests were still in evidence, the unfortunate inhabitants of thedeforested lands now see their crops wither for lack of rainfall, whilethe seasons grow more and more irregular; and as the air becomes dryercertain crops refuse longer to grow at all. That everything dries outfaster than formerly is shown by the fact that the level of the wellsall over the land has sunk perceptibly, many of them having becometotally dry. In addition to the resulting agricultural distress, thewatercourses have changed. Formerly they were narrow and deep, with anabundance of clear water the year around; for the roots and humus ofthe forests caught the rainwater and let it escape by slow, regularseepage. They have now become broad, shallow stream beds, in whichmuddy water trickles in slender currents during the dry seasons, whilewhen it rains there are freshets, and roaring muddy torrents cometearing down, bringing disaster and destruction everywhere. Moreover,these floods and freshets, which diversify the general dryness, washaway from the mountain sides, and either wash away or cover in thevalleys, the rich fertile soil which it took tens of thousands of yearsfor Nature to form; and it is lost forever, and until the forests growagain it can not be replaced. The sand and stones from the mountainsides are washed loose and come rolling down to cover the arable lands,and in consequence, throughout this part of China, many formerly richdistricts are now sandy wastes, useless for human cultivation and evenfor pasture. The cities have been of course seriously affected, for thestreams have gradually ceased to be navigable. There is testimony thateven within the memory of men now living there has been a seriousdiminution of the rainfall of northeastern China. The level of theSungari River in northern Manchuria has been sensibly lowered duringthe last fifty years, at least partly as the result of theindiscriminate rutting of the forests forming its watershed. Almost allthe rivers of northern China have become uncontrollable, and verydangerous to the dwellers along their banks, as a direct result of thedestruction of the forests. The journey from Pekin to Jehol shows inmelancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from wholevalleys, so that they have been converted into deserts.In northern China this disastrous process has gone on so long and hasproceeded so far that no complete remedy could be applied. There arecertain mountains in China from which the soil is gone so utterly thatonly the slow action of the ages could again restore it; although ofcourse much could be done to prevent the still further eastwardextension of the Mongolian Desert if the Chinese Government would actat once. The accompanying cuts from photographs show the inconceivabledesolation of the barren mountains in which certain of these riversrise mountains, be it remembered, which formerly supported denseforests of larches and firs, now unable to produce any wood, andbecause of their condition a source of danger to the whole country. Thephotographs also show the same rivers after they have passed throughthe mountains, the beds having become broad and sandy because of thedeforestation of the mountains. One of the photographs shows a caravanpassing through a valley. Formerly, when the mountains were forested,it was thickly peopled by prosperous peasants. Now the floods havecarried destruction all over the land and the valley is a stony desert.Another photograph shows a mountain road covered with the stones androcks that are brought down in the rainy season from the mountainswhich have already been deforested by human hands. Another shows apebbly river bed in southern Manchuria where what was once a greatstream has dried up owing to the deforestation in the mountains. Onlysome scrub wood is left, which will disappear within a half century.Yet another shows the effect of one of the washouts, destroying anarable mountain side, these washouts being due to the removal of allvegetation; yet in this photograph the foreground shows thatreforestation is still a possibility in places.What has thus happened in northern China, what has happened in CentralAsia, in Palestine, in North Africa, in parts of the Mediterraneancountries of Europe, will surely happen in our country if we do notexercise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief marksof any people calling itself civilized. Nothing should be permitted tostand in the way of the preservation of the forests, and it is criminalto permit individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves throughthe destruction of forests when this destruction is fatal to thewell being of the whole country in the future.INLAND WATERWAYS.Action should be begun forthwith, during the present session of theCongress, for the improvement of our inland waterways action whichwill result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. Wehave spent hundreds of millions of dollars upon these waterways, yetthe traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declining. This conditionis the direct result of the absence of any comprehensive and far seeingplan of waterway improvement, Obviously we can not continue thus toexpend the revenues of the Government without return. It is poorbusiness to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it.Inquiry into the condition of the Mississippi and its principaltributaries reveals very many instances of the utter waste caused bythe methods which have hitherto obtained for the so called"improvement" of navigation. A striking instance is supplied by the"improvement" of the Ohio, which, begun in 1824, was continued under asingle plan for half a century. In 1875 a new plan was adopted andfollowed for a quarter of a century. In 1902 still a different plan wasadopted and has since been pursued at a rate which only promises anavigable river in from twenty to one hundred years longer.Such shortsighted, vacillating, and futile methods are accompanied bydecreasing water borne commerce and increasing traffic congestion onland, by increasing floods, and by the waste of public money. Theremedy lies in abandoning the methods which have so signally failed andadopting new ones in keeping with the needs and demands of our people.In a report on a measure introduced at the first session of the presentCongress, the Secretary of War said: "The chief defect in the methodshitherto pursued lies in the absence of executive authority fororiginating comprehensive plans covering the country or naturaldivisions thereof." In this opinion I heartily concur. The presentmethods not only fail to give us inland navigation, but they areinjurious to the army as well. What is virtually a permanent detail ofthe corps of engineers to civilian duty necessarily impairs theefficiency of our military establishment. The military engineers haveundoubtedly done efficient work in actual construction, but they arenecessarily unsuited by their training and traditions to take the broadview, and to gather and transmit to the Congress the commercial andindustrial information and forecasts, upon which waterway improvementmust always so largely rest. Furthermore, they have failed to grasp thegreat underlying fact that every stream is a unit from its source toits mouth, and that all its uses are interdependent. Prominent officersof the Engineer Corps have recently even gone so far as to assert inprint that waterways are not dependent upon the conservation of theforests about their headwaters. This position is opposed to all therecent work of the scientific bureaus of the Government and to thegeneral experience of mankind. A physician who disbelieved invaccination would not be the right man to handle an epidemic ofsmallpox, nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the transmissionof yellow fever by the Stegomyia mosquito in charge of sanitation atHavana or Panama. So with the improvement of our rivers; it is nolonger wise or safe to leave this great work in the hands of men whofail to grasp the essential relations between navigation and generaldevelopment and to assimilate and use the central facts about ourstreams.Until the work of river improvement is undertaken in a modern way itcan not have results that will meet the needs of this modern nation.These needs should be met without further dilly dallying or delay. Theplan which promises the best and quickest results is that of apermanent commission authorized to coordinate the work of all theGovernment departments relating to waterways, and to frame andsupervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such acommission the actual work of construction might be entrusted to thereclamation service; or to the military engineers acting with asufficient number of civilians to continue the work in time of war; orit might be divided between the reclamation service and the corps ofengineers. Funds should be provided from current revenues if it isdeemed wise otherwise from the sale of bonds. The essential thing isthat the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and withthe least possible delay. We should have a new type of work and a neworganization for planning and directing it. The time for playing withour waterways is past. The country demands results.NATIONAL PARKS.I urge that all our National parks adjacent to National forests beplaced completely under the control of the forest service of theAgricultural Department, instead of leaving them as they now are, underthe Interior Department and policed by the army. The Congress shouldprovide for superintendents with adequate corps of first class civilianscouts, or rangers, and, further, place the road construction under thesuperintendent instead of leaving it with the War Department. Such achange in park management would result in economy and avoid thedifficulties of administration which now arise from having theresponsibility of care and protection divided between differentdepartments. The need for this course is peculiarly great in theYellowstone Park. This, like the Yosemite, is a great wonderland, andshould be kept as a national playground. In both, all wild thingsshould be protected and the scenery kept wholly unmarred.I am happy to say that I have been able to set aside in various partsof the country small, well chosen tracts of ground to serve assanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures.DENATURED ALCOHOL.I had occasion in my message of May 4, 1906, to urge the passage ofsome law putting alcohol, used in the arts, industries, andmanufactures, upon the free list that is, to provide for thewithdrawal free of tax of alcohol which is to be denatured for thosepurposes. The law of June 7, 1906, and its amendment of March 2, 1907,accomplished what was desired in that respect, and the use of denaturedalcohol, as intended, is making a fair degree of progress and isentitled to further encouragement and support from the Congress.PURE FOOD.The pure food legislation has already worked a benefit difficult tooverestimate.INDIAN SERVICE.It has been my purpose from the beginning of my administration to takethe Indian Service completely out of the atmosphere of politicalactivity, and there has been steady progress toward that end. The lastremaining stronghold of politics in that service was the agency system,which had seen its best days and was gradually falling to pieces fromnatural or purely evolutionary causes, but, like all such survivals,was decaying slowly in its later stages. It seems clear that itsextinction had better be made final now, so that the ground can becleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians,preparatory to their induction into the full measure of responsiblecitizenship. On November 1 only eighteen agencies were left on theroster; with two exceptions, where some legal questions seemed to standtemporarily in the way, these have been changed to superintendencies,and their heads brought into the classified civil service.SECRET SERVICE.Last year an amendment was incorporated in the measure providing forthe Secret Service, which provided that there should be no detail fromthe Secret Service and no transfer therefrom. It is not too much to saythat this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefitonly, to the criminal classes. If deliberately introduced for thepurpose of diminishing the effectiveness of war against crime it couldnot have been better devised to this end. It forbade the practices thathad been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive heads ofvarious departments for twenty years. To these practices we owe thesecuring of the evidence which enabled us to drive great lotteries outof business and secure a quarter of a million of dollars in fines fromtheir promoters. These practices have enabled us to get some of theevidence indispensable in order in connection with the theft ofgovernment land and government timber by great corporations and byindividuals. These practices have enabled us to get some of theevidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of thewealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the Government hasto deal, both those operating in violation of the anti trust law andothers. The amendment in question was of benefit to no one excepting tothese criminals, and it seriously hampers the Government in thedetection of crime and the securing of justice. Moreover, it not onlyaffects departments outside of the Treasury, but it tends to hamper theSecretary of the Treasury himself in the effort to utilize theemployees of his department so as to best meet the requirements of thepublic service. It forbids him from preventing frauds upon the customsservice, from investigating irregularities in branch mints and assayoffices, and has seriously crippled him. It prevents the promotion ofemployees in the Secret Service, and this further discourages goodeffort. In its present form the restriction operates only to theadvantage of the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The chief argument infavor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wishto be investigated by Secret Service men. Very little of suchinvestigation has been done in the past; but it is true that the workof the Secret Service agents was partly responsible for the indictmentand conviction of a Senator and a Congressman for land frauds inOregon. I do not believe that it is in the public interest to protectcriminally in any branch of the public service, and exactly as we haveagain and again during the past seven years prosecuted and convictedsuch criminals who were in the executive branch of the Government, soin my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if foundin the legislative branch. But if this is not considered desirable aspecial exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of theSecret Service force in investigating members of the Congress. It wouldbe far better to do this than to do what actually was done, and striveto prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals bythe executive branch of the Government.POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.I again renew my recommendation for postal savings hanks, fordepositing savings with the security of the Government behind them. Theobject is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage earner and personof moderate means. In 14 States the deposits in savings banks asreported to the Comptroller of the Currency amount to $3,590,245,402,or 98.4 per cent of the entire deposits, while in the remaining 32States there are only $70,308,543, or 1.6 per cent, showingconclusively that there are many localities in the United States wheresufficient opportunity is not given to the people to deposit theirsavings. The result is that money is kept in hiding and unemployed. Itis believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be broughtinto circulation through the instrumentality of the postal savingsbanks. While there are only 1,453 savings banks reporting to theComptroller there are more than 61,000 post offices, 40,000 of whichare money order offices. Postal savings banks are now in operation inpractically all of the great civilized countries with the exception ofthe United States.PARCEL POST.In my last annual message I commended the Postmaster General\'srecommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes.The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be tothe mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper, and it isdesirable that the routes, serving more than 15,000,000 people, shouldbe utilized to the fullest practicable extent. An amendment wasproposed in the Senate at the last session, at the suggestion of thePostmaster General, providing that, for the purpose of ascertaining thepracticability of establishing a special local parcel post system onthe rural routes throughout the United States, the Postmaster Generalbe authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress theresult of such experiment by establishing a special local parcel postsystem on rural delivery routes in not to exceed four counties in theUnited States for packages of fourth class matter originating on arural route or at the distributing post office for delivery by ruralcarriers. It would seem only proper that such an experiment should betried in order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposition,especially as the Postmaster General estimates that the revenue derivedfrom the operation of such a system on all the rural routes wouldamount to many million dollars.EDUCATION.The share that the National Government should take in the broad work ofeducation has not received the attention and the care it rightlydeserves. The immediate responsibility for the support and improvementof our educational systems and institutions rests and should alwaysrest with the people of the several States acting through their stateand local governments, but the Nation has an opportunity in educationalwork which must not be lost and a duty which should no longer beneglected.The National Bureau of Education was established more than forty yearsago. Its purpose is to collect and diffuse such information "as shallaid the people of the United States in the establishment andmaintenance of efficient school systems and otherwise promote the causeof education throughout the country." This purpose in no way conflictswith the educational work of the States, but may be made of greatadvantage to the States by giving them the fullest, most accurate, andhence the most helpful information and suggestion regarding the besteducational systems. The Nation, through its broader field ofactivities, its wider opportunity for obtaining information from allthe States and from foreign countries, is able to do that which noteven the richest States can do, and with the distinct additionaladvantage that the information thus obtained is used for the immediatebenefit of all our people.With the limited means hitherto provided, the Bureau of Education hasrendered efficient service, but the Congress has neglected toadequately supply the bureau with means to meet the educational growthof the country. The appropriations for the general work of the bureau,outside education in Alaska, for the year 1909 are but $87,500 anamount less than they were ten years ago, and some of the importantitems in these appropriations are less than they were thirty years ago.It is an inexcusable waste of public money to appropriate an amountwhich is so inadequate as to make it impossible properly to do the workauthorized, and it is unfair to the great educational interests of thecountry to deprive them of the value of the results which can beobtained by proper appropriations.I earnestly recommend that this unfortunate state of affairs as regardsthe national educational office be remedied by adequate appropriations.This recommendation is urged by the representatives of our commonschools and great state universities and the leading educators, who allunite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the Congressupon this subject.CENSUS.I strongly urge that the request of the Director of the Census inconnection with the decennial work so soon to be begun be complied withand that the appointments to the census force be placed under the civilservice law, waiving the geographical requirements as requested by theDirector of the Census. The supervisors and enumerators should not beappointed under the civil service law, for the reasons given by theDirector. I commend to the Congress the careful consideration of theadmirable report of the Director of the Census, and I trust that hisrecommendations will be adopted and immediate action thereon taken.PUBLIC HEALTH.It is highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on thepart of the Nation on the question of preserving the health of thecountry. Through the practical extermination in San Francisco ofdisease bearing rodents our country has thus far escaped the bubonicplague. This is but one of the many achievements of American healthofficers; and it shows what can be accomplished with a betterorganization than at present exists. The dangers to public health fromfood adulteration and from many other sources, such as the menace tothe physical, mental and moral development of children from childlabor, should be met and overcome. There are numerous diseases, whichare now known to be preventable, which are, nevertheless, notprevented. The recent International Congress on Tuberculosis has madeus painfully aware of the inadequacy of American public healthlegislation. This Nation can not afford to lag behind in the world widebattle now being waged by all civilized people with the microscopicfoes of mankind, nor ought we longer to ignore the reproach that thisGovernment takes more pains to protect the lives of hogs and of cattlethan of human beings.REDISTRIBUTION OF BUREAUS.The first legislative step to be taken is that for the concentration ofthe proper bureaus into one of the existing departments. I thereforeurgently recommend the passage of a bill which shall authorize aredistribution of the bureaus which shall best accomplish this end.GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.I recommend that legislation be enacted placing under the jurisdictionof the Department of Commerce and Labor the Government Printing Office.At present this office is under the combined control, supervision, andadministrative direction of the President and of the Joint Committee onPrinting of the two Houses of the Congress. The advantage of having the4,069 employees in this office and the expenditure of the $5,761,377.57appropriated therefor supervised by an executive department is obvious,instead of the present combined supervision.SOLDIERS\' HOMES.All Soldiers\' Homes should be placed under the complete jurisdictionand control of the War Department.INDEPENDENT BUREAUS AND COMMISSIONS.Economy and sound business policy require that all existing independentbureaus and commissions should be placed under the jurisdiction ofappropriate executive departments. It is unwise from every standpoint,and results only in mischief, to have any executive work done save bythe purely executive bodies, under the control of the President; andeach such executive body should be under the immediate supervision of aCabinet Minister.STATEHOOD.I advocate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as States.This should be done at the present session of the Congress. The peopleof the two Territories have made it evident by their votes that theywill not come in as one State. The only alternative is to admit them astwo, and I trust that this will be done without delay.INTERSTATE FISHERIES.I call the attention of the Congress to the importance of the problemof the fisheries in the interstate waters. On the Great Lakes we arenow, under the very wise treaty of April 11th of this year, endeavoringto come to an international agreement for the preservation andsatisfactory use of the fisheries of these waters which can nototherwise be achieved. Lake Erie, for example, has the richest freshwater fisheries in the world; but it is now controlled by the statutesof two Nations, four States, and one Province, and in this Province bydifferent ordinances in different counties. All these politicaldivisions work at cross purposes, and in no case can they achieveprotection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and justice to thelocalities and individuals on the other. The case is similar in PugetSound.But the problem is quite as pressing in the interstate waters of theUnited States. The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but afraction of what they were twenty five years ago, and what they wouldbe now if the United States Government had taken complete charge ofthem by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During thesetwenty five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried totake all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been ableto agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for theprotection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregonside is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washingtonside of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as tothe very statutes under which this action and non action result.Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably fouryears hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from astruggle between the associated, or gill net, fishermen on the onehand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river. The fisheriesof the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Potomac are also in a bad way.For this there is no remedy except for the United States to control andlegislate for the interstate fisheries as part of the business ofinterstate commerce. In this case the machinery for scientificinvestigation and for control already exists in the United StatesBureau of Fisheries. In this as in similar problems the obvious andsimple rule should be followed of having those matters which noparticular State can manage taken in hand by the United States;problems which in the seesaw of conflicting State legislatures areabsolutely unsolvable are easy enough for Congress to control.FISHERIES AND FUR SEALS.The federal statute regulating interstate traffic in game should beextended to include fish. New federal fish hatcheries should beestablished. The administration of the Alaskan fur seal service shouldbe vested in the Bureau of Fisheries.FOREIGN AFFAIRS.This Nation\'s foreign policy is based on the theory that right must bedone between nations precisely as between individuals, and in ouractions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faithby our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, towards other nationsas in private life an honorable man would behave towards his fellows.LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS.The commercial and material progress of the twenty Latin AmericanRepublics is worthy of the careful attention of the Congress. No othersection of the world has shown a greater proportionate development ofits foreign trade during the last ten years and none other has morespecial claims on the interest of the United States. It offers to dayprobably larger opportunities for the legitimate expansion of ourcommerce than any other group of countries. These countries will wantour products in greatly increased quantities, and we shallcorrespondingly need theirs. The International Bureau of the AmericanRepublics is doing a useful work in making these nations and theirresources better known to us, and in acquainting them not only with usas a people and with our purposes towards them, but with what we haveto exchange for their goods. It is an international institutionsupported by all the governments of the two Americas.PANAMA CANAL.The work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed, efficiency andentire devotion to duty which make it a model for all work of the kind.No task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by anynation; and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The menon the isthmus, from Colonel Goethals and his fellow commissionersthrough the entire list of employees who are faithfully doing theirduty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude ofthe American people.OCEAN MAIL LINERS.I again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so thatsatisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America, Asia, thePhilippines, and Australasia may be established. The creation of suchsteamship lines should be the natural corollary of the voyage of thebattle fleet. It should precede the opening of the Panama Canal. Evenunder favorable conditions several years must elapse before such linescan be put into operation. Accordingly I urge that the Congress actpromptly where foresight already shows that action sooner or later willbe inevitable.HAWAII.I call particular attention to the Territory of Hawaii. The importanceof those islands is apparent, and the need of improving their conditionand developing their resources is urgent. In recent years industrialconditions upon the islands have radically changed, The importation ofcoolie labor has practically ceased, and there is now developing such adiversity in agricultural products as to make possible a change in theland conditions of the Territory, so that an opportunity may be givento the small land owner similar to that on the mainland. To aid thesechanges, the National Government must provide the necessary harborimprovements on each island, so that the agricultural products can becarried to the markets of the world. The coastwise shipping laws shouldbe amended to meet the special needs of the islands, and the aliencontract labor law should be so modified in its application to Hawaiias to enable American and European labor to be brought thither.We have begun to improve Pearl Harbor for a naval base and to providethe necessary military fortifications for the protection of theislands, but I can not too strongly emphasize the need ofappropriations for these purposes of such an amount as will within theshortest possible time make those islands practically impregnable. Itis useless to develop the industrial conditions of the islands andestablish there bases of supply for our naval and merchant fleetsunless we insure, as far as human ingenuity can, their safety fromforeign seizure.One thing to be remembered with all our fortifications is that it isalmost useless to make them impregnable from the sea if they are leftopen to land attack. This is true even of our own coast, but it isdoubly true of our insular possessions. In Hawaii, for instance, it isworse than useless to establish a naval station unless we establish itbehind fortifications so strong that no landing force can take themsave by regular and long continued siege operations.THE PHILIPPINES.Real progress toward self government is being made in the PhilippineIslands. The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and Philippineassembly marks a process absolutely new in Asia, not only as regardsAsiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic possessionsof other Asiatic powers; and, indeed, always excepting the striking andwonderful example afforded by the great Empire of Japan, it opens anentirely new departure when compared with anything which has happenedamong Asiatic powers which are their own masters. Hitherto thisPhilippine legislature has acted with moderation and self restraint,and has seemed in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth thatthere must always be government, and that the only way in which anybody of individuals can escape the necessity of being governed byoutsiders is to show that they are able to restrain themselves, to keepdown wrongdoing and disorder. The Filipino people, through theirofficials, are therefore making real steps in the direction ofself government. I hope and believe that these steps mark the beginningof a course which will continue till the Filipinos become fit to decidefor themselves whether they desire to be an independent nation. But itis well for them (and well also for those Americans who during the pastdecade have done so much damage to the Filipinos by agitation for animmediate independence for which they were totally unfit) to rememberthat self government depends, and must depend, upon the Filipinosthemselves. All we can do is to give them the opportunity to developthe capacity for self government. If we had followed the advice of thefoolish doctrinaires who wished us at any time during the last tenyears to turn the Filipino people adrift, we should have shirked theplainest possible duty and have inflicted a lasting wrong upon theFilipino people. We have acted in exactly the opposite spirit. We havegiven the Filipinos constitutional government a government based uponjustice and we have shown that we have governed them for their goodand not for our aggrandizement. At the present time, as during the pastten years, the inexorable logic of facts shows that this governmentmust be supplied by us and not by them. We must be wise and generous;we must help the Filipinos to master the difficult art of self control,which is simply another name for self government. But we can not givethem self government save in the sense of governing them so thatgradually they may, if they are able, learn to govern themselves. Underthe present system of just laws and sympathetic administration, we haveevery reason to believe that they are gradually acquiring the characterwhich lies at the basis of self government, and for which, if it belacking, no system of laws, no paper constitution, will in any wiseserve as a substitute. Our people in the Philippines have achieved whatmay legitimately be called a marvelous success in giving to them agovernment which marks on the part of those in authority both thenecessary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose toserve them disinterestedly and in good faith. I trust that within ageneration the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide forthemselves whether it is well for them to become independent, or tocontinue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power, ableto guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreigninvasion. But no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wiseto consider independence as a fixed and definite policy. It would beworse than folly to try to set down such a date in advance, for it mustdepend upon the way in which the Philippine people themselves developthe power of self mastery.PORTO RICO.I again recommend that American citizenship be conferred upon thepeople of Porto Rico.CUBA.In Cuba our occupancy will cease in about two months\' time, the Cubanshave in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, andthe island will be turned over to them. Our occupation on this occasionhas lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and prosperedunder it. Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of theisland shall now govern themselves with justice, so that peace andorder may be secure. We will gladly help them to this end; but I wouldsolemnly warn them to remember the great truth that the only way apeople can permanently avoid being governed from without is to showthat they both can and will govern themselves from within.JAPANESE EXPOSITION.The Japanese Government has postponed until 1917 the date of the greatinternational exposition, the action being taken so as to insure ampletime in which to prepare to make the exposition all that it should bemade. The American commissioners have visited Japan and thepostponement will merely give ampler opportunity for America to berepresented at the exposition. Not since the first internationalexposition has there been one of greater importance than this will be,marking as it does the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to thethrone of the Emperor of Japan. The extraordinary leap to a foremostplace among the nations of the world made by Japan during this halfcentury is something unparalleled in all previous history. Thisexposition will fitly commemorate and signalize the giant progress thathas been achieved. It is the first exposition of its kind that has everbeen held in Asia. The United States, because of the ancient friendshipbetween the two peoples, because each of us fronts on the Pacific, andbecause of the growing commercial relations between this country andAsia, takes a peculiar interest in seeing the exposition made a successin every way.I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way inwhich in Japan, in Australia, in New Zealand, and in all the States ofSouth America, the battle fleet has been received on its practicevoyage around the world. The American Government can not too stronglyexpress its appreciation of the abounding and generous hospitalityshown our ships in every port they visited.THE ARMY.As regards the Army I call attention to the fact that while our juniorofficers and enlisted men stand very high, the present system ofpromotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher grades manymen of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No manshould regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in theArmy any more than in any other profession. It is a curious and by nomeans creditable fact that there should be so often a failure on thepart of the public and its representatives to understand the greatneed, from the standpoint of the service and the Nation, of refusing topromote respectable, elderly incompetents. The higher places should begiven to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at leastseniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress ofmodern industrial competition no business firm could succeed if thoseresponsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground thatthey were the oldest people in its employment; yet this is the courseadvocated as regards the Army, and required by law for all gradesexcept those of general officer. As a matter of fact, all of the bestofficers in the highest ranks of the Army are those who have attainedtheir present position wholly or in part by a process of selection.The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they couldconsider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to securea far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination ofofficers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But thisplan is recommended only if the Congress does not see fit to providewhat in my judgment is far better; that is, for selection in promotion,and for elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rankby a certain age should be retired for instance, if a man should notattain field rank by the time he is 45 he should of course be placed onthe retired list. General officers should be selected as at present,and one third of the other promotions should be made by selection, theselection to be made by the President or the Secretary of War from alist of at least two candidates proposed for each vacancy by a board ofofficers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to bemade. A bill is now before the Congress having for its object to securethe promotion of officers to various grades at reasonable ages througha process of selection, by boards of officers, of the least efficientfor retirement with a percentage of their pay depending upon length ofservice. The bill, although not accomplishing all that should be done,is a long step in the right direction; and I earnestly recommend itspassage, or that of a more completely effective measure.The cavalry arm should be reorganized upon modern lines. This is an armin which it is peculiarly necessary that the field officers should notbe old. The cavalry is much more difficult to form than infantry, andit should be kept up to the maximum both in efficiency and in strength,for it can not be made in a hurry. At present both infantry andartillery are too few in number for our needs. Especial attentionshould be paid to development of the machine gun. A general servicecorps should be established. As things are now the average soldier hasfar too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform.NATIONAL GUARD.Now that the organized militia, the National Guard, has beenincorporated with the Army as a part of the national forces, itbehooves the Government to do every reasonable thing in its power toperfect its efficiency. It should be assisted in its instruction andotherwise aided more liberally than heretofore. The continuous servicesof many well trained regular officers will be essential in thisconnection. Such officers must be specially trained at service schoolsbest to qualify them as instructors of the National Guard. But thedetailing of officers for training at the service schools and for dutywith the National Guard entails detaching them from their regimentswhich are already greatly depleted by detachment of officers forassignment to duties prescribed by acts of the Congress.A bill is now pending before the Congress creating a number of extraofficers in the Army, which if passed, as it ought to be, will enablemore officers to be trained as instructors of the National Guard andassigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of the utmostimportance to have a large number of trained officers to use forturning raw levies into good troops.There should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organizingthe great body of volunteers behind the Regular Army and National Guardwhen war has come. Congressional assistance should be given those whoare endeavoring to promote rifle practice so that our men, in theservices or out of them, may know how to use the rifle. While teamsrepresenting the United States won the rifle and revolver championshipsof the world against all comers in England this year, it isunfortunately true that the great body of our citizens shoot less andless as time goes on. To meet this we should encourage rifle practiceamong schoolboys, and indeed among all classes, as well as in themilitary services, by every means in our power. Thus, and nototherwise, may we be able to assist in preserving the peace of theworld. Fit to hold our own against the strong nations of the earth, ourvoice for peace will carry to the ends of the earth. Unprepared, andtherefore unfit, we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves,protect others, or preserve peace. The first step in the direction ofpreparation to avert war if possible, and to be fit for war if itshould come is to teach our men to shoot.THE NAVY.I approve the recommendations of the General Board for the increase ofthe Navy, calling especial attention to the need of additionaldestroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It isdesirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eightbattleships of the best existing type. The North Dakota, Delaware,Florida, and Utah will form the first division of this squadron. Thefour vessels proposed will form the second division. It will be animprovement on the first, the ships being of the heavy, single caliber,all big gun type. All the vessels should have the same tacticalqualities that is, speed and turning circle and as near as possiblethese tactical qualities should be the same as in the four vesselsbefore named now being built.I most earnestly recommend that the General Board be by law turned intoa General Staff. There is literally no excuse whatever for continuingthe present bureau organization of the Navy. The Navy should be treatedas a purely military organization, and everything should besubordinated to the one object of securing military efficiency. Suchmilitary efficiency can only be guaranteed in time of war if there isthe most thorough previous preparation in time of peace a preparation,I may add, which will in all probability prevent any need of war. TheSecretary must be supreme, and he should have as his official advisersa body of line officers who should themselves have the power to passupon and coordinate all the work and all the proposals of the severalbureaus. A system of promotion by merit, either by selection or byexclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced. It is out of thequestion, if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority iskept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers. Ourmen come too old, and stay for too short a time, in the high commandpositions.Two hospital ships should be provided. The actual experience of thehospital ship with the fleet in the Pacific has shown the invaluablework which such a ship does, and has also proved that it is well tohave it kept under the command of a medical officer. As was to beexpected, all of the anticipations of trouble from such a command haveproved completely baseless. It is as absurd to put a hospital shipunder a line officer as it would be to put a hospital on shore undersuch a command. This ought to have been realized before, and there isno excuse for failure to realize it now.Nothing better for the Navy from every standpoint has ever occurredthan the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The improvementof the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and they have gainedfar more experience in battle tactics than they would have gained ifthey had stayed in the Atlantic waters. The American people have causefor profound gratification, both in view of the excellent condition ofthe fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the improvement thecruise has worked in this already high condition. I do not believe thatthere is any other service in the world in which the average ofcharacter and efficiency in the enlisted men is as high as is now thecase in our own. I believe that the same statement can be made as toour officers, taken as a whole; but there must be a reservation made inregard to those in the highest ranks as to which I have alreadyspoken and in regard to those who have just entered the service;because we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval schoolat Annapolis. It is absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as ensigns;to keep them for two years in such an anomalous position as at presentthe law requires is detrimental to them and to the service. In theacademy itself, every first classman should be required in turn toserve as petty officer and officer; his ability to discharge his dutiesas such should be a prerequisite to his going into the line, and hissuccess in commanding should largely determine his standing atgraduation. The Board of Visitors should be appointed in January, andeach member should be required to give at least six days\' service, onlyfrom one to three days\' to be performed during June week, which is theleast desirable time for the board to be at Annapolis so far asbenefiting the Navy by their observations is concerned.THE WHITE HOUSE,Tuesday, December 8, 1908.
Warren Harding
MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:It is a very gratifying privilege to come to the Congress with the Republicat peace with all the nations of the world. More, it is equally gratifyingto report that our country is not only free from every impending, menace ofwar, but there are growing assurances of the permanency of the peace whichwe so deeply cherish.For approximately ten years we have dwelt amid menaces of war or asparticipants in war\'s actualities, and the inevitable aftermath, with itsdisordered conditions, bits added to the difficulties of government whichadequately can not be appraised except by, those who are in immediatecontact and know the responsibilities. Our tasks would be less difficult ifwe had only ourselves to consider, but so much of the world was involved,the disordered conditions are so well nigh universal, even among nationsnot engaged in actual warfare, that no permanent readjustments can beeffected without consideration of our inescapable relationship to worldaffairs in finance and trade. Indeed, we should be unworthy of our besttraditions if we were unmindful of social, moral, and political conditionswhich are not of direct concern to us, but which do appeal to the humansympathies and the very becoming interest of a people blest with ournational good fortune.It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration. In themain such a program must be worked out by the nations more directlyconcerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic remedies for themenacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, andwe mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly because there is compensationin the consciousness of assisting, selfishly because the commerce andinternational exchanges in trade, which marked our high tide of fortunateadvancement, are possible only when the nations of all continents arerestored to stable order and normal relationship.In the main the contribution of this Republic to restored normalcy in theworld must come through the initiative of the executive branch of theGovernment, but the best of intentions and most carefully consideredpurposes would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of Congresswere not cheerfully accorded.I am very sure we shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutionalduties or authority. During the anxieties of war, when necessity seemedcompelling there were excessive grants of authority and all extraordinaryconcentration of powers in the Chief Executive. The repeal of war timelegislation and the automatic expirations which attended the peaceproclamations have put an end to these emergency excesses but I have thewish to go further than that. I want to join you ill restoring , ill themost cordial way, the spirit of coordination and cooperation, and thatmutuality of confidence and respect which is necessary ill representativepopular government.Encroachment upon the functions of Congress or attempted dictation of itspolicy are not to be thought of, much less attempted, but there is allinsistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed thesolution of the difficult problems confronting both the legislative andexecutive branches of the Government.It is worth while to make allusion here to the character of our CloveGovernment, mindful as one must be that an address to you is no less itmessage to all our people, for whom you speak most intimately. Ours is itpopular Government through political parties. We divide along politicallines, and I would ever have it so. I do not mean that partisan preferencesshould hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious andpatriotic official duty. We saw partisan lines utterly obliterated when warimperiled, and our faith in the Republic was riveted anew. We ought not tofind these partisan lines obstructing the expeditious solution of theurgent problems of peace.Granting that we are fundamentally a representative popular Government,with political parties the governing agencies, I believe the politicalparty in power should assume responsibility, determine upon policies illthe conference which supplements conventions and election campaigns, andthen strive for achievement through adherence to the accepted policy.There is vastly greater security, immensely more of the nationalviewpoint, much larger and prompter accomplishment where our divisions arealong party lines, in the broader and loftier sense, than to dividegeographically, or according to pursuits, or personal following. For acentury and a third, parties have been charged with responsibility and heldto strict accounting. When they fail, they are relieved of authority; andthe system has brought its to a national eminence no less than a worldexample.Necessarily legislation is a matter of compromise. The full ideal is seldomattained. In that meeting of minds necessary to insure results, there mustand will be accommodations and compromises, but in the estimate ofconvictions and sincere put poses the supreme responsibility to nationalinterest must not be ignored. The shield to the high minded public servantwho adheres to party policy is manifest, but the higher purpose is the goodof the Republic as a whole.It would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really largevolume and excellent quality of work accomplished by the extraordinarysession of Congress which so recently adjourned. I am not unmindful of thevery difficult tasks with which you were called to deal, and no one canignore the insistent conditions which, during recent years, have called forthe continued and almost exclusive attention of your membership to publicwork. It would suggest insincerity if I expressed complete accord withevery expression recorded in your roll calls, but we are all agreed aboutthe difficulties and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seeking thereduction, amelioration and readjustment of the burdens of taxation. Lateron, when other problems are solved, I shall make some recommendations aboutrenewed consideration of our tax program, but for the immediate time beforeus we must be content with the billion dollar reduction in the tax draftupon the people, and diminished irritations, banished uncertainty andimproved methods of collection. By your sustainment of the rigid economiesalready inaugurated, with hoped for extension of these economies and addedefficiencies in administration, I believe further reductions may be enactedand hindering burdens abolished.In these urgent economies we shall be immensely assisted by the budgetsystem for which you made provision in the extraordinary session. The firstbudget is before you. Its preparation is a signal achievement, and theperfection of the system, a thing impossible in the few months availablefor its initial trial, will mark its enactment as the beginning of thegreatest reformation in governmental practices since the beginning of theRepublic.There is pending a grant of authority to the administrative branch of theGovernment for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loans growingout of our grant of war credits. With the hands of the executive branchheld impotent to deal with these debts we are hindering urgentreadjustments among our debtors and accomplishing nothing for ourselves. Ithink it is fair for the Congress to assume that the executive branch ofthe Government would adopt no major policy in dealing with these matterswhich would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans,certainly not without asking congressional approval, but there are minorproblems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguarding of ourinterests which can not even be attempted without this authorization. Itwill be helpful to ourselves and it will improve conditions among ourdebtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may benegotiated.The previous Congress, deeply concerned in behalf of our merchant marine,in 1920 enacted the existing shipping law, designed for the upbuilding ofthe American merchant marine. Among other things provided to encourage ourshipping on the world\'s seas, the Executive was directed to give notice ofthe termination of all existing commercial treaties in order to admit ofreduced duties on imports carried in American bottoms. During the life ofthe act no Executive has complied with this order of the Congress. When thepresent administration came into responsibility it began an early inquiryinto the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones Act. Onlyone conclusion has been possible. Frankly, Members of House and Senate,eager its I am to join you in the making of an American merchant marinecommensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of our commercialtreaties would involve us in a chaos of trade relationships and addindescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world.Our power to do so is not disputed, but power and ships, without comity ofrelationship, will not give us the expanded trade which is inseparablylinked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction ofduty, for which the treaty denouncements were necessary, encouraged onlythe carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage whichunfurls the flag on the seas is both free and dutiable, and the cargoeswhich make it nation eminent in trade are outgoing, rather than incoming.It is not my thought to lay the problem before you in detail today. It isdesired only to say to you that the executive branch of the Government,uninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made, is wellconvinced that your proposal, highly intended and heartily supported here,is so fraught with difficulties and so marked by tendencies to discouragetrade expansion, that I invite your tolerance of noncompliance for only afew weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draftupon the Public Treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer itto day, gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine, that it willargue its own approval. It is enough to say to day that we are so possessedof ships, and the American intention to establish it merchant marine is sounalterable, that a plain of reimbursement, at no other cost than iscontemplated in the existing act, will appeal to the pride and encouragethe hope of all the American people.There is before you the completion of the enactment of what has been termeda "permanent" tariff law, the word "permanent" being used to distinguishit from the emergency act which the Congress expedited early in theextraordinary session, and which is the law today. I can not too stronglyurge in early completion of this necessary legislation It is needed tostabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite ourtrade relations abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many ofour own industries which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of ourNation.There is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting opinionabout any tariff revision. We can not go far wrong when we base our tariffson the policy of preserving the productive activities which enhanceemployment and add to our national prosperity.Again comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world conditions,that peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilitation and that we cannot dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time dothe just thing in aiding world reconstruction and readjustment. We do notseek a selfish aloofness, and we could not profit by it, were it possible.We recognize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanencyof trade lies in its acceptable exchanges. In our pursuit of markets wemust give as well as receive. We can not sell to others who do not produce,nor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of every obligation ofhumanity, commerce and finance, linked as they are in the present worldcondition, it is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to behelpful to others. With all my heart I wish restoration to the peoplesblighted by the awful World War, but the process of restoration does notlie in our acceptance of like conditions. It were better to, remain on firmground, strive for ample employment and high standards of wage at home, andpoint the way to balanced budgets, rigid economies, and resolute, efficientwork as the necessary remedies to cure disaster.Everything relating to trade, among ourselves and among nations, has beenexpanded, excessive, inflated, abnormal, and there is a madness in financewhich no American policy alone will cure. We are a creditor Nation, not bynormal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfishness toseek to save ourselves, when the processes of that salvation are not onlynot denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine forothers no industry by which they subsist; we are obligated to permit theundermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintainedactivities.Every contemplation, it little matters in which direction one turns,magnifies the difficulty of tariff legislation, but the necessity of therevision is magnified with it. Doubtless we are justified in seeking it.More flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will befound to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjustedto meet unusual and changing conditions which can not be accuratelyanticipated. There are problems incident to unfair practices, and toexchanges which madness in money have made almost unsolvable. I know of nomanner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of thepowers of the Tariff Commission so that it can adapt itself to itscientific and wholly just administration of the law.I am not unmindful of the constitutional difficulties. These can be met bygiving authority to the Chief Executive, who could proclaim additionalduties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate.At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the Executive\'s powersor add to the responsibilities of the office. They are already too large.If there were any other plan I would prefer it.The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the TariffCommission into new and enlarged activities, because no Executive coulddischarge such a duty except upon the information acquired andrecommendations made by this commission. But the plan is feasible, and theproper functioning of the board would give its it better administration ofa defined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribedwithout flexibility.There is a manifest difference of opinion about the merits of Americanvaluation. Many nations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis forcollecting duties; that is, they take the cost of the imports delivered atthe port of entry as the basis for levying duty. It is no radicaldeparture, in view of varying conditions and the disordered state of moneyvalues, to provide for American valuation, but there can not be ignored thedanger of such a valuation, brought to the level of our own productioncosts, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do so in many instanceswhere imports ought to be encouraged. I believe Congress ought wellconsider the desirability of the only promising alternative, namely, aprovision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribedconditions, on any given list of articles imported.In this proposed flexibility, authorizing increases to meet conditions solikely to change, there should also be provision for decreases. A rate maybe just to day, and entirely out of proportion six months from to day. Ifour tariffs are to be made equitable, and not necessarily burden ourimports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessaryfor years to come. Knowing the impossibility of modification by act ofCongress for any one or a score of lines without involving a long array ofschedules, I think we shall go a long ways toward stabilization, if thereis recognition of the Tariff Commission\'s fitness to recommend urgentchanges by proclamation.I am sure about public opinion favoring the early determination of ourtariff policy. There have been reassuring signs of a business revival fromthe deep slump which all the world has been experiencing. Our unemployment,which gave its deep concern only a few weeks ago, has grown encouraginglyless, and new assurances and renewed confidence will attend thecongressional declaration that American industry will be held secure.Much has been said about the protective policy for ourselves making itimpossible for our debtors to discharge their obligations to us. This is acontention not now pressing for decision. If we must choose between apeople in idleness pressing for the payment of indebtedness, or a peopleresuming the normal ways of employment and carrying the credit, let uschoose the latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human ill most vividin our minds. We have been giving, and are giving now, of our influence andappeals to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crushingburdens of armament. It is all very earnest, with a national soulimpelling. But a people unemployed, and gaunt with hunger, face a situationquite as disheartening as war, and our greater obligation to day is to dothe Government\'s part toward resuming productivity and promoting fortunateand remunerative employment.Something more than tariff protection is required by American agriculture.To the farmer has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment.There is actual depression in our agricultural industry, while agriculturalprosperity is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of thecountry.Congress has sought very earnestly to provide relief. It has promptly givensuch temporary relief as has been possible, but the call is insistent forthe permanent solution. It is inevitable that large crops lower the pricesand short crops advance them. No legislation can cure that fundamental law.But there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation inreturns for agricultural production.It is rather shocking to be told, and to have the statement stronglysupported, that 9,000,000 bales of cotton, raised on American plantationsin a given year, will actually be worth more to the producers than13,000,000 bales would have been. Equally shocking is the statement that700,000,000 bushels of wheat, raised by American farmers, would bring themmore money than a billion bushels. Yet these are not exaggeratedstatements. In a world where there are tens of millions who need food andclothing which they can not get, such a condition is sure to indict thesocial system which makes it possible.In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every properencouragement should be given to the cooperative marketing programs. Thesehave proven very helpful to the cooperating communities in Europe. InRussia the cooperative community has become the recognized bulwark of lawand order, and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis.Ultimately they will be accredited with the salvation of the RussianState.There is the appeal for this experiment. Why not try it? No one challengesthe right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumer\'s pay for hisproduct, no one disputes that we can not live without the farmer. He isjustified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fairreturn for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financialaid; and given assurance that his labors shall not be in vain, we reassureall the people of a production sufficient to meet our National requirementand guard against disaster.The base of the pyramid of civilization which rests upon the soil isshrinking through the drift of population from farm to city. For ageneration we have been expressing more or less concern about thistendency. Economists have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thoughtfor at time that modern conveniences and the more intimate contact wouldhalt the movement, but it has gone steadily on. Perhaps only grim necessitywill correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy.The existing scheme of adjusting freight rates hits been favoring thebasing points, until industries are attracted to some centers and repelledfrom others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation hasattended, and the cost increased accordingly. The grain milling andmeat packing industries afford ample illustration, and the attendingconcentration is readily apparent. The menaces in concentration are notlimited to the retardingly influences on agriculture. Manifestly the.conditions and terms of railway transportation ought not be permitted toincrease this undesirable tendency. We have a just pride in our greatcities, but we shall find a greater pride in the Nation, which has itlarger distribution of its population into the country, where comparativelyself sufficient smaller communities may blend agricultural andmanufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and enhanced goodfortune. Such a movement contemplates no destruction of things wrought, ofinvestments made, or wealth involved. It only looks to a general policy oftransportation of distributed industry, and of highway construction, toencourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balancebetween city and country. The problem may well have your earnestattention.It has been perhaps the proudest claim of our American civilization that indealing with human relationships it has constantly moved toward suchjustice in distributing the product of human energy that it has improvedcontinuously the economic status of the mass of people. Ours has been ahighly productive social organization. On the way up from the elementalstages of society we have eliminated slavery and serfdom and are now far onthe way to the elimination of poverty.Through the eradication of illiteracy and the diffusion of educationmankind has reached a stage where we may fairly say that in the UnitedStates equality of opportunity has been attained, though all are notprepared to embrace it. There is, indeed, a too great divergence betweenthe economic conditions of the most and the least favored classes in thecommunity. But even that divergence has now come to the point where webracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunateclasses. Our efforts may well be directed to improving the status of both.While this set of problems is commonly comprehended under the generalphrase "Capital and labor," it is really vastly broader. It is a questionof social and economic organization. Labor has become a large contributor,through its savings, to the stock of capital; while the people who own thelargest individual aggregates of capital are themselves often hard andearnest laborers. Very often it is extremely difficult to draw the line ofdemarcation between the two groups; to determine whether a particularindividual is entitled to be set down as laborer or as capitalist. In avery large proportion of cases he is both, and when he is both he is themost useful citizen.The right of labor to organize is just as fundamental and necessary as isthe right of capital to organize. The right of labor to negotiate, to dealwith and solve its particular problems in an organized way, through itschosen agents, is just as essential as is the right of capital to organize,to maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed,we have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as amember of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation ofliability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit.Along this line of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress towardsolution of our problem of capital and labor.In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limitedliability of stockholders, particularly when engaged in in the publicservice, it is recognized that the outside public has a large concernwhich must be protected; and so we provide regulations, restrictions, andin some cases detailed supervision. Likewise in the case of labororganizations, we might well apply similar and equally well definedprinciples of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public\'sinterests as affected by their operations.Just as it is not desirable that a corporation shall be allowed to imposeundue exactions upon the public, so it is not desirable that a labororganization shall be permitted to exact unfair terms of employment orsubject the public to actual distresses in order to enforce its terms.Finally, just as we are earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjustand settle political differences between nations without resort to war, sowe may well look about for means to settle the differences betweenorganized capital and organized labor without resort to those forms ofwarfare which we recognize under the name of strikes, lockouts, boycotts,and the like.As we have great bodies of law carefully regulating the organization andoperations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treatiesand compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differenceswithout the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans ofconference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration, and judicialdetermination in controversies between labor and capital. To accomplishthis would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoing code ofpractice in dealing with such affairs It might be well to frankly set forththe superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor groupor the capital group. With rights, privileges, immunities, and modes oforganization thus carefully defined, it should be possible to set upjudicial or quasi judicial tribunals for the consideration anddetermination of all disputes which menace the public welfare.In an industrial society such as ours the strike, the lockout, and theboycott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as iswar or armed revolution in the domain of politics. The same disposition toreasonableness, to conciliation, to recognition of the other side\'s pointof view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes,ought to make it possible to solve the one set of questions its easily asthe other. I believe the solution is possible.The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of careand deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elementalrights, dealing with the relations of employer and employee. Thisfoundation in the law, dealing with the modern conditions of social andeconomic life, would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industrywhich a rejoicing nation would acclaim.After each war, until the last, the Government has been enabled to givehomes to its returned soldiers, and a large part of our settlement anddevelopment has attended this generous provision of land for the Nation\'sdefenders.There is yet unreserved approximately 200,000,000 acres in the publicdomain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible ofreclamation and made fit for homes by provision for irrigation.The Government has been assisting in the development of its remaininglands, until the estimated increase in land values in the irrigatedsections is full $500,000,000 and the crops of 1920 alone on these landsare estimated to exceed $100,000,000. Under the law authorization theseexpenditures for development the advances are to be returned and it wouldbe good business for the Government to provide for the reclamation of theremaining 20,000,000 acres, in addition to expediting the completion ofprojects long under way.Under what is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also todeposits of phosphates and other minerals on the public domain, leases arenow being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large revenues tothe Government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all royalties isto be paid directly to the Federal Treasury, and of the remainder 50 percentum is to be used for reclamation of arid lands by irrigation, and 40per centum is to be paid to the States, in which the operations arelocated, to be used by them for school and road purposes.These resources are so vast, and the development is affording so reliable abasis of estimate, that the Interior Department expresses the belief thatultimately the present law will add in royalties and payments to thetreasuries of the Federal Government and the States containing these publiclands a total of $12,000,000,000. This means, of course, an added wealth ofmany times that sum. These prospects seem to afford every justification ofGovernment advances in reclamation and irrigation.Contemplating the inevitable and desirable increase of population, there isanother phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration. There are79,000,000 acres of swamp and cut over lands which may be reclaimed andmade as valuable as any farm lands we possess. These acres are largelylocated in Southern States, and the greater proportion is owned by theStates or by private citizens. Congress has a report of the survey of thisfield for reclamation, and the feasibility is established. I gladly commendFederal aid, by way of advances, where State and private participation isassured.Home making is one of the greater benefits which government can bestow.Measures are pending embodying this sound policy to which we may welladhere. It is easily possible to make available permanent homes which willprovide, in turn, for prosperous American families, without injuriouscompetition with established activities, or imposition on wealth alreadyacquired.While we are thinking of promoting the fortunes of our own people I am surethere is room in the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human beingswho are suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. A severe drought inthe Valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into grievous famine.Our voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save thelives of children in this area, but it is now evident that unless relief isafforded the loss of life will extend into many millions. America can notbe deaf to such a call as that.We do not recognize the government of Russia, nor tolerate the propagandawhich emanates therefrom, but we do not forget the traditions of Russianfriendship. We may put aside our consideration of all internationalpolitics and fundamental differences in government. The big thing is thecall of the suffering and the dying. Unreservedly I recommend theappropriation necessary to supply the American Relief Administration with10,000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grains, not aloneto halt the wave of death through starvation, but to enable spring plantingin areas where the seed grains have been exhausted temporarily to stemstarvation.The American Relief Administration is directed in Russia by former officersof our own armies, and has fully demonstrated its ability to transport anddistribute relief through American hands without hindrance or loss. Thetime has come to add the Government\'s support to the wonderful reliefalready wrought out of the generosity of the American private purse.I am not unaware that we have suffering and privation at home. When itexceeds the capacity for the relief within the States concerned, it willhave Federal consideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to ourown heart promptings, and out of accord with the spirit which acclaims theChristmastide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lightenthis burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine\'s peril.There are it full score of topics concerning which it would be becoming toaddress you, and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I havealluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I can notend this limited address without a suggested amendment to the organic law.Many of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant aboutaltering the fundamental law. I think our tax problems, the tendency ofwealth to seek nontaxable investment, and the menacing increase of publicdebt, Federal, State and municipal all justify a proposal to change theConstitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bonds. No action canchange the status of the many billions outstanding, but we can guardagainst future encouragement of capital\'s paralysis, while a halt in thegrowth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout our wholeland.Such a change in the Constitution must be very thoroughly considered beforesubmission. There ought to be known what influence it will have on theinevitable refunding of our vast national debt, how it will operate on thenecessary refunding of State and municipal debt, how the advantages ofNation over State and municipality, or the contrary, may be avoided.Clearly the States would not ratify to their own apparent disadvantage. Isuggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxablesecurities is hindering the flow of large capital to our industries,manufacturing, agricultural, and carrying, until we are discouraging thevery activities which make our wealth.Agreeable to your expressed desire and in complete accord with the purposesof the executive branch of the Government, there is in Washington, as youhappily know, an International Conference now most earnestly at work onplans for the limitation of armament, a naval holiday, and the justsettlement of problems which might develop into causes of internationaldisagreement.It is easy to believe a world hope is centered on this Capital City. A mostgratifying world accomplishment is not improbable.
Warren Harding
MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:So many problems are calling for solution that a recital of all of them, inthe face of the known limitations of a short session of Congress, wouldseem to lack sincerity of purpose. It is four years since the World Warended, but the inevitable readjustment of the social and economic order isnot more than barely begun. There is no acceptance of pre war conditionsanywhere in the world. In a very general way humanity harbors individualwishes to go on with war time compensation for production, with pre warrequirements in expenditure. In short, everyone, speaking broadly, cravesreadjustment for everybody except himself, while there can be no just andpermanent readjustment except when all participate.The civilization which measured its strength of genius and the power ofscience and the resources of industries, in addition to testing the limitsof man power and the endurance and heroism of men and women that samecivilization is brought to its severest test in restoring a tranquil orderand committing humanity to the stable ways of peace.If the sober and deliberate appraisal of pre war civilization makes it seema worth while inheritance, then with patience and good courage it will bepreserved. There never again will be precisely the old order; indeed, Iknow of no one who thinks it to be desirable For out of the old order camethe war itself, and the new order, established and made secure, never willpermit its recurrence.It is no figure of speech to say we have come to the test of Ourcivilization. The world has been passing is today passing through of agreat crisis. The conduct of war itself is not more difficult than thesolution of the problems which necessarily follow. I am not speaking atthis moment of the problem in its wider aspect of world rehabilitation orof international relationships. The reference is to our own social,financial, and economic problems at home. These things are not to beconsidered solely as problems apart from all international relationship,but every nation must be able to carry on for itself, else itsinternational relationship will have scant importance.Doubtless our own people have emerged from the World War tumult lessimpaired than most belligerent powers; probably we have made largerprogress toward reconstruction. Surely we have been fortunate indiminishing unemployment, and our industrial and business activities, whichare the lifeblood of our material existence, have been restored as in noother reconstruction period of like length in the history of the world. Hadwe escaped the coal and railway strikes, which had no excuse for theirbeginning and less justification for their delayed settlement, we shouldhave done infinitely better. But labor was insistent on holding to the warheights, and heedless forces of reaction sought the pre war levels, andboth were wrong. In the folly of conflict our progress was hindered, andthe heavy cost has not yet been fully estimated. There can be neitheradjustment nor the penalty of the failure to readjust in which all do notsomehow participate.The railway strike accentuated the difficulty of the American farmer. Thefirst distress of readjustment came to the farmer, and it will not be areadjustment fit to abide until he is relieved. The distress brought to thefarmer does not affect him alone. Agricultural ill fortune is a nationalill fortune. That one fourth of our population which produces the food ofthe Republic and adds so largely to our export commerce must participate inthe good fortunes of the Nation, else there is none worth retaining.Agriculture is a vital activity in our national life. In it we had ourbeginning, and its westward march with the star of the empire has reflectedthe growth of the Republic. It has its vicissitudes which no legislationwill prevent, its hardships for which no law can provide escape. But theCongress can make available to the farmer the financial facilities whichhave been built up under Government aid and supervision for othercommercial and industrial enterprises. It may be done on the same solidfundamentals and make the vitally important agricultural industry moresecure, and it must be done.This Congress already has taken cognizance of the misfortune whichprecipitate deflation brought to American agriculture. Your measures ofrelief and the reduction of the Federal reserve discount rate undoubtedlysaved the country from widespread disaster. The very proof of helpfulnessalready given is the strongest argument for the permanent establishment ofwidened credits, heretofore temporarily extended through the War FinanceCorporation.The Farm Loan Bureau, which already has proven its usefulness through theFederal land banks, may well have its powers enlarged to provide ample farmproduction credits as well as enlarged land credits. It is entirelypractical to create a division in the Federal land banks to deal withproduction credits, with the limitations of time so adjusted to the farmturnover as the Federal reserve system provides for the turnover in themanufacturing and mercantile world. Special provision must be made forlive stock production credits, and the limit of land loans may be safelyenlarged. Various measures are pending before you, and the best judgment ofCongress ought to be expressed in a prompt enactment at the presentsession.But American agriculture needs more than added credit facilities. Thecredits will help to solve the pressing problems growing out ofwar inflated land values and the drastic deflation of three years ago, butpermanent and deserved agricultural good fortune depends on better andcheaper transportation.Here is an outstanding problem, demanding the most rigorous considerationof the Congress and the country. It has to do with more than agriculture.It provides the channel for the flow of the country\'s commerce. But thefarmer is particularly hard hit. His market, so affected by the worldconsumption, does not admit of the price adjustment to meet carryingcharges. In the last half of the year now closing the railways, broken incarrying capacity because of motive power and rolling stock out of order,though insistently declaring to the contrary, embargoed his shipments ordenied him cars when fortunate markets were calling. Too frequentlytransportation failed while perishable products were turning from possibleprofit to losses counted in tens of millions.I know of no problem exceeding in importance this one of transportation. Inour complex and interdependent modern life transportation is essential toour very existence. Let us pass for the moment the menace in the possibleparalysis of such service as we have and note the failure, for whateverreason, to expand our transportation to meet the Nation\'s needs.The census of 1880 recorded a population of 50,000,000. In two decades morewe may reasonably expect to count thrice that number. In the three decadesending in 1920 the country\'s freight by rail increased from 631,000,000tons to 2,234,000,000 tons; that is to say, while our population wasincreasing, less than 70 per cent, the freight movement increased over 250per cent.We have built 40 per cent of the world\'s railroad mileage, and yet find itinadequate to our present requirements. When we contemplate the inadequacyof to day it is easy to believe that the next few decades will witness theparalysis of our transportation using social scheme or a completereorganization on some new basis. Mindful of the tremendous costs ofbetterments, extensions, and expansions, and mindful of the staggeringdebts of the world to day, the difficulty is magnified. Here is a problemdemanding wide vision and the avoidance of mere makeshifts. No matter whatthe errors of the past, no matter how we acclaimed construction and thencondemned operations in the past, we have the transportation and the honestinvestment in the transportation which sped us on to what we are, and weface conditions which reflect its inadequacy to day, its greater inadequacyto morrow, and we contemplate transportation costs which much of thetraffic can not and will not continue to pay.Manifestly, we have need to begin on plans to coordinate all transportationfacilities. We should more effectively connect up our rail lines with ourcarriers by sea. We ought to reap some benefit from the hundreds ofmillions expended on inland waterways, proving our capacity to utilize aswell as expend. We ought to turn the motor truck into a railway feeder anddistributor instead of a destroying competitor.It would be folly to ignore that we live in a motor age. The motor carreflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present daylife. It long ago ran down Simple Living, and never halted to inquire aboutthe prostrate figure which fell as its victim. With full recognition ofmotor car transportation we must turn it to the most practical use. It cannot supersede the railway lines, no matter how generously we afford ithighways out of the Public Treasury. If freight traffic by motor werecharged with its proper and proportionate share of highway construction, weshould find much of it wasteful and more costly than like service by rail.Yet we have paralleled the railways, a most natural line of construction,and thereby taken away from the agency of expected service much of itsprofitable traffic, which the taxpayers have been providing the highways,whose cost of maintenance is not yet realized.The Federal Government has a right to inquire into the wisdom of thispolicy, because the National Treasury is contributing largely to thishighway construction. Costly highways ought to be made to serve as feedersrather than competitors of the railroads, and the motor truck should becomea coordinate factor in our great distributing system.This transportation problem can not be waived aside. The demand for loweredcosts on farm products and basic materials can not be ignored. Rateshorizontally increased, to meet increased wage outlays during the warinflation, are not easily reduced. When some very moderate wage reductionswere effected last summer there was a 5 per cent horizontal reduction inrates. I sought at that time, in a very informal way, to have the railwaymanagers go before the Interstate Commerce Commission and agree to aheavier reduction on farm products and coal and other basic commodities,and leave unchanged the freight tariffs which a very large portion of thetraffic was able to bear. Neither the managers nor the commission tilesuggestion, so we had the horizontal reduction saw fit to adopt too slightto be felt by the higher class cargoes and too little to benefit the heavytonnage calling most loudly for relief.Railways are not to be expected to render the most essential service in oursocial organization without a air return on capital invested, but theGovernment has gone so far in the regulation of rates and rules ofoperation that it has the responsibility of pointing the way to the reducedfreight costs so essential to our national welfare.Government operation does not afford the cure. It was Government operationwhich brought us to the very order of things against which we now rebel,and we are still liquidating the costs of that supreme folly.Surely the genius of the railway builders has not become extinct among therailway managers. New economies, new efficiencies in cooperation must befound. The fact that labor takes 50 to 60 per cent of total railwayearnings makes limitations within which to effect economies very difficult,but the demand is no less insistent on that account.Clearly the managers are without that intercarrier, cooperativerelationship so highly essential to the best and most economical operation.They could not function in harmony when the strike threatened the paralysisof all railway transportation. The relationship of the service to publicwelfare, so intimately affected by State and Federal regulation, demandsthe effective correlation and a concerted drive to meet an insistent andjustified public demand.The merger of lines into systems, a facilitated interchange of freightcars, the economic use of terminals, and the consolidation of facilitiesare suggested ways of economy and efficiency.I remind you that Congress provided a Joint Commission of AgriculturalInquiry which made an exhaustive investigation of car service andtransportation, and unanimously recommended in its report of October 15,1921, the pooling of freight cars under a central agency. This report welldeserves your serious consideration. I think well of the central agency,which shall be a creation of the railways themselves, to provide, under thejurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the means for financingequipment for carriers which are otherwise unable to provide theirproportion of car equipment adequate to transportation needs. This sameagency ought to point the way to every possible economy in maintainedequipment and the necessary interchanges in railway commerce.In a previous address to the Congress I called to your attention theinsufficiency of power to enforce the decisions of the Railroad LaborBoard. Carriers have ignored its decisions, on the one hand, railwayworkmen have challenged its decisions by a strike, on the other hand.The intent of Congress to establish a tribunal to which railway labor andmanagers may appeal respecting questions of wages and working conditionscan not be too strongly commended. It is vitally important that some suchagency should be a guaranty against suspended operation. The public must bespared even the threat of discontinued service.Sponsoring the railroads as we do, it is an obligation that labor shall beassured the highest justice and every proper consideration of wage andworking conditions, but it is an equal obligation to see that no concertedaction in forcing demands shall deprive the public of the transportationservice essential to its very existence. It is now impossible to safeguardpublic interest, because the decrees of the board are unenforceable againsteither employer or employee.The Labor Board itself is not so constituted as best to serve the publicinterest. With six partisan members on a board of nine, three partisansnominated by the employees and three by the railway managers, it isinevitable that the partisan viewpoint is maintained throughout hearingsand in decisions handed down. Indeed, the few exceptions to a strictlypartisan expression in decisions thus far rendered have been followed byaccusations of betrayal of the partisan interests represented. Only thepublic group of three is free to function in unbiased decisions. Thereforethe partisan membership may well be abolished, and decisions should be madeby an impartial tribunal.I am well convinced that the functions of this tribunal could be muchbetter carried on here in Washington. Even were it to be continued as aseparate tribunal, there ought to be contact with the Interstate CommerceCommission, which has supreme authority in the rate making to which wagecost bears an indissoluble relationship Theoretically, a fair and livingwage must be determined quite apart from the employer\'s earning capacity,but in practice, in the railway service, they are inseparable. The recordof advanced rates to meet increased wages, both determined by theGovernment, is proof enough.The substitution of a labor division in the Interstate Commerce Commissionmade up from its membership, to hear and decide disputes relating to wagesand working conditions which have failed of adjustment by proper committeescreated by the railways and their employees, offers a more effective plan.It need not be surprising that there is dissatisfaction over delayedhearings and decisions by the present board when every trivial dispute iscarried to that tribunal. The law should require the railroads and theiremployees to institute means and methods to negotiate between themselvestheir constantly arising differences, limiting appeals to the Governmenttribunal to disputes of such character as are likely to affect the publicwelfare.This suggested substitution will involve a necessary increase in themembership of the commission, probably four, to constitute the labordivision. If the suggestion appeals to the Congress, it will be well tospecify that the labor division shall be constituted of representatives ofthe four rate making territories, thereby assuring a tribunal conversantwith the conditions which obtain in the different ratemaking sections ofthe country.I wish I could bring to you the precise recommendation for the preventionof strikes which threaten the welfare of the people and menace publicsafety. It is an impotent civilization and an inadequate government whichlacks the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to publicwelfare as we experienced last summer. You were aware of the Government\'sgreat concern and its futile attempt to aid in an adjustment. It willreveal the inexcusable obstinacy which was responsible for so much distressto the country to recall now that, though all disputes are not yetadjusted, the many settlements which have been made were on the terms whichthe Government proposed in mediation.Public interest demands that ample power shall be conferred upon the. labortribunal, whether it is the present board or the suggested substitute, torequire its rulings to be accepted by both parties to a disputed question.Let there be no confusion about the purpose of the suggested conferment ofpower to make decisions effective. There can be no denial of constitutionalrights of either railway workmen or railway managers. No man can be deniedhis right to labor when and how he chooses, or cease to labor when he soelects, but, since the Government assumes to safeguard his interests whileemployed in an essential public service, the security of society itselfdemands his retirement from the service shall not be so timed and relatedas to effect the destruction of that service. This vitally essential publictransportation service, demanding so much of brain and brawn, so much forefficiency and security, ought to offer the most attractive workingconditions and the highest of wages paid to workmen in any employment.In essentially every branch, from track repairer to the man at thelocomotive throttle, the railroad worker is responsible for the safety ofhuman lives and the care of vast property. His high responsibility mightwell rate high his pay within the limits the traffic will bear; but thesame responsibility, plus governmental protection, may justly deny him andhis associates a withdrawal from service without a warning or undercircumstances which involve the paralysis of necessary transportation. Wehave assumed so great a responsibility in necessary regulation that weunconsciously have assumed the responsibility for maintained service;therefore the lawful power for the enforcement of decisions is necessaryto sustain the majesty of government and to administer to the publicwelfare.During its longer session the present Congress enacted a new tariff law.The protection of the American standards of living demanded the insuranceit provides against the distorted conditions of world commerce The framersof the law made provision for a certain flexibility of customs duties,whereby it is possible to readjust them as developing conditions mayrequire. The enactment has imposed a large responsibility upon theExecutive, but that responsibility will be discharged with a broadmindfulness of the whole business situation. The provision itself admitseither the possible fallibility of rates or their unsuitableness tochanging conditions. I believe the grant of authority may be promptly anddiscreetly exercised, ever mindful of the intent and purpose to safeguardAmerican industrial activity, and at the same time prevent the exploitationof the American consumer and keep open the paths of such liberal exchangesas do not endanger our own productivity.No one contemplates commercial aloofness nor any other aloofnesscontradictory to the best American traditions or loftiest human purposes.Our fortunate capacity for comparative self containment affords the firmfoundation on which to build for our own security, and a like foundation onwhich to build for a future of influence and importance in world commerce.Our trade expansion must come of capacity and of policies of righteousnessand reasonableness in till our commercial relations.Let no one assume that our provision for maintained good fortune at home,and our unwillingness to assume the correction of all the ills of theworld, means a reluctance to cooperate with other peoples or to assumeevery just obligation to promote human advancement anywhere in the world.War made its a creditor Nation. We did not seek an excess possession of theworld\'s gold, and we have neither desire to profit Unduly by its possessionnor permanently retain it. We do not seek to become an internationaldictator because of its power.The voice of the United States has a respectful hearing in internationalcouncils, because we have convinced the world that we have no selfish endsto serve, no old grievances to avenge, no territorial or other greed tosatisfy. But the voice being heard is that of good counsel, not ofdictation. It is the voice of sympathy and fraternity and helpfulness,seeking to assist but not assume for the United States burdens whichnations must bear for themselves. We would rejoice to help rehabilitatecurrency systems and facilitate all commerce which does not drag us to thevery levels of those we seek to lift up.While I have everlasting faith in our Republic, it would be folly, indeed,to blind ourselves to our problems at home. Abusing the hospitality of ourshores are the advocates of revolution, finding their deluded followersamong those who take on the habiliments of an American without knowing anAmerican soul. There is the recrudescence of hyphenated Americanism whichwe thought to have been stamped out when we committed the Nation, life andsoul, to the World War.There is a call to make the alien respect our institutions while heaccepts our hospitality. There is need to magnify the American viewpoint tothe alien who seeks a citizenship among us. There is need to magnify thenational viewpoint to Americans throughout the land. More there is a demandfor every living being in the United States to respect and abide by thelaws of the Republic. Let men who are rending the moral fiber of theRepublic through easy contempt for the prohibition law, because they thinkit restricts their personal liberty, remember that they set the example andbreed a contempt for law which will ultimately destroy the Republic.Constitutional prohibition has been adopted by the Nation. It is thesupreme law of the land. In plain speaking, there are conditions relatingto its enforcement which savor of nation wide scandal. It is the mostdemoralizing factor in our public life.Most of our people assumed that the adoption of the eighteenth amendmentmeant the elimination of the question from our politics. On the contrary,it has been so intensified as an issue that many voters are disposed tomake all political decisions with reference to this single question. It isdistracting the public mind and prejudicing the judgment of theelectorate.The day is unlikely to come when the eighteenth amendment will be repealed.The fact may as well be recognized and our course adapted accordingly. Ifthe statutory provisions for its enforcement are contrary to deliberatepublic opinion, which I do not believe the rigorous and literal enforcementwill concentrate public attention on any requisite modification. Such acourse, conforms with the law and saves the humiliation of the Governmentand the humiliation of our people before the world, and challenges thedestructive forces engaged in widespread violation, official corruption andindividual demoralization.The eighteenth amendment involves the concurrent authority of State andFederal Governments, for the enforcement of the policy it defines. Acertain lack of definiteness, through division of responsibility is thusintroduced. In order to bring about a full understanding of duties andresponsibilities as thus distributed, I purpose to invite the governors ofthe States and Territories, at an early opportunity, to a conference withthe Federal Executive authority. Out of the full and free considerationswhich will thus be possible, it is confidently believed, will emerge a moreadequate, comprehension of the whole problem, and definite policies ofNational and State cooperation in administering the laws.There are pending bills for the registration of the alien who has come toour shores. I wish the passage of such an act might be expedited. Life amidAmerican opportunities is worth the cost of registration if it is worth theseeking, and the Nation has the right to know who are citizens in themaking or who live among us anti share our advantages while seeking toundermine our cherished institutions. This provision will enable us toguard against the abuses in immigration, checking the undesirable whoseirregular Willing is his first violation of our laws. More, it willfacilitate the needed Americanizing of those who mean to enroll as fellowcitizens.Before enlarging the immigration quotas we had better provide registrationfor aliens, those now here or continually pressing for admission, andestablish our examination boards abroad, to make sure of desirables only.By the examination abroad we could end the pathos at our ports, when menand women find our doors closed, after long voyages and wasted savings,because they are unfit for admission It would be kindlier and safer to tellthem before they embark.Our program of admission and treatment of immigrants is very intimatelyrelated to the educational policy of the Republic With illiteracy estimatedat front two tenths of 1 per cent to less than 2 per cent in 10 of theforemost nations of Europe it rivets our attention to it serious problemwhen we are reminded of a 6 per cent illiteracy in the United States. Thefigures are based on the test which defines an Illiterate as one having noschooling whatever. Remembering the wide freedom of our public schoolswith compulsory attendance in many States in the Union, one is convincedthat much of our excessive illiteracy comes to us from abroad, and theeducation of the immigrant becomes it requisite to his Americanization. Itmust be done if he is fittingly to exercise the duties as well as enjoy theprivileges of American citizenship. Here is revealed the special field forFederal cooperation in furthering education.From the very beginning public education has been left mainly in the handsof the States. So far as schooling youth is concerned the policy has beenjustified, because no responsibility can be so effective as that of thelocal community alive to its task. I believe in the cooperation of thenational authority to stimulate, encourage, and broaden the work of thelocal authorities. But it is the especial obligation of the FederalGovernment to devise means and effectively assist in the education of thenewcomer from foreign lands, so that the level of American education may bemade the highest that is humanly possible.Closely related to this problem of education is the abolition of childlabor. Twice Congress has attempted the correction of the evils incident tochild employment. The decision of the Supreme Court has put this problemoutside the proper domain of Federal regulation until the Constitution isso amended as to give the Congress indubitable authority. I recommend thesubmission of such an amendment.We have two schools of thought relating to amendment of the Constitution.One need not be committed to the belief that amendment is weakening thefundamental law, or that excessive amendment is essential to meet everyephemeral whim. We ought to amend to meet the demands of the people whensanctioned by deliberate public opinion.One year ago I suggested the submission of an amendment so that we maylawfully restrict the issues of tax exempt securities, and I renew thatrecommendation now. Tax exempt securities are drying up the sources ofFederal taxation and they are encouraging unproductive and extravagantexpenditures by States and municipalities. There is more than the menace inmounting public debt, there is the dissipation of capital which should bemade available to the needs of productive industry. The proposed amendmentwill place the State and Federal Governments and all political subdivisionson an exact equality, and will correct the growing menace of publicborrowing, which if left unchecked may soon threaten the stability of ourinstitutions.We are so vast and so varied in our national interests that scores ofproblems are pressing for attention. I must not risk the wearying of yourpatience with detailed reference.Reclamation and irrigation projects, where waste land may be made availablefor settlement and productivity, are worthy of your favorableconsideration.When it is realized that we are consuming our timber four times as rapidlyas we are growing it, we must encourage the greatest possible cooperationbetween the Federal Government, the various States, and the owners offorest lands, to the end that protection from fire shall be made moreeffective and replanting encouraged.The fuel problem is under study now by a very capable fact findingcommission, and any attempt to deal with the coal problem, of such deepconcern to the entire Nation, must await the report of the commission.There are necessary studies of great problems which Congress might wellinitiate. The wide spread between production costs and prices whichconsumers pay concerns every citizen of the Republic. It contributes verylargely to the unrest in agriculture and must stand sponsor for muchagainst which we inveigh in that familiar term the high cost of living.No one doubts the excess is traceable to the levy of the middleman, but itwould be unfair to charge him with all responsibility before we appraisewhat is exacted of him by our modernly complex life. We have attacked theproblem on one side by the promotion of cooperative marketing, and we mightwell inquire into the benefits of cooperative buying. Admittedly, theconsumer is much to blame himself, because of his prodigal expenditure andhis exaction of service, but Government might well serve to point the wayof narrowing the spread of price, especially between the production of foodand its consumption.A superpower survey of the eastern industrial region has recently beencompleted, looking to unification of steam, water, and electric powers, andto a unified scheme of power distribution. The survey proved that vasteconomies in tonnage movement of freights, and in the efficiency of therailroads, would be effected if the superpower program were adopted. I amconvinced that constructive measures calculated to promote such anindustrial development I am tempted to say, such an industrialrevolution would be well worthy the careful attention and fosteringinterest of the National Government.The proposed survey of a plan to draft all the resources of the Republic,human and material, for national defense may well have your approval. Icommended such a program in case of future war, in the inaugural address.of March 4, 1921, and every experience in the adjustment and liquidation ofwar claims and the settlement of war obligations persuades me we ought tobe prepared for such universal call to armed defense.I bring you no apprehension of war. The world is abhorrent of it, and ourown relations are not only free from every threatening cloud, but we havecontributed our larger influence toward making armed conflict less likely.Those who assume that we played our part in the World War and later tookourselves aloof and apart, unmindful of world obligations, give scantcredit to the helpful part we assume in international relationships.Whether all nations signatory ratify all the treaties growing out of theWashington Conference on Limitation of Armament or some withhold approval,the underlying policy of limiting naval armament has the sanction of thelarger naval powers, and naval competition is suspended. Of course,unanimous ratification is much to be desired.The four power pact, which abolishes every probability of war on thePacific, has brought new confidence in a maintained peace, and I can wellbelieve it might be made a model for like assurances wherever in the worldany common interests are concerned.We have had expressed the hostility of the American people to asupergovernment or to any commitment where either a council or an assemblyof leagued powers may chart our course. Treaties of armed alliance can haveno likelihood of American sanction, but we believe in respecting the rightsof nations, in the value of conference and consultation, in theeffectiveness of leaders of nations looking each other in the face acebefore resorting to the arbitrament of arms.It has been our fortune both to preach and promote internationalunderstanding. The influence of the United States in bringing near thesettlement of an ancient dispute between South American nations is addedproof of the glow of peace in ample understanding. In Washington to day aremet the delegates of the Central American nations, gathered at the table ofinternational understanding, to stabilize their Republics and remove everyvestige of disagreement. They are met here by our invitation, not in ouraloofness, and they accept our hospitality because they have faith in ourunselfishness and believe in our helpfulness. Perhaps we are selfish incraving their confidence and friendship, but such a selfishness we proclaimto the world, regardless of hemisphere, or seas dividing.I would like the Congress and the people of the Nation to believe that in afirm and considerate way we are insistent on American rights wherever theymay be questioned, and deny no rights of others in the assertion of ourown. Moreover we are cognizant of the world\'s struggles for fullreadjustment and rehabilitation, and we have shirked no duty which comes ofsympathy, or fraternity, or highest fellowship among nations. Everyobligation consonant with American ideals and sanctioned under our form ofgovernment is willingly met. When we can not support we do not demand. Ourconstitutional limitations do not forbid the exercise of a moral influence,the measure of which is not less than the high purposes we have sought toserve.After all there is less difference about the part this great Republic shallplay in furthering peace and advancing humanity than in the manner ofplaying it. We ask no one to assume responsibility for us; we assume noresponsibility which others must bear for themselves, unless nationality ishopelessly swallowed up in internationalism.
Calvin Coolidge
Since the close of the last Congress the Nation has lost President Harding.The world knew his kindness and his humanity, his greatness and hischaracter. He has left his mark upon history. He has made justice morecertain and peace more secure. The surpassing tribute paid to his memory ashe was borne across the continent to rest at last at home revealed theplace he held in the hearts of the American people. But this is not theoccasion for extended reference to the man or his work. In this presence,among these who knew and loved him, that is unnecessary. But we who wereassociated with him could not resume together the functions of our officewithout pausing for a moment, and in his memory reconsecrating ourselves tothe service of our country. He is gone. We remain. It is our duty, underthe inspiration of his example, to take up the burdens which he waspermitted to lay down, and to develop and support the wise principles ofgovernment which he represented.FOREIGN AFFAIRSFor us peace reigns everywhere. We desire to perpetuate it always bygranting full justice to others and requiring of others full justice toourselves.Our country has one cardinal principle to maintain in its foreign policy.It is an American principle. It must be an American policy. We attend toour own affairs, conserve our own strength, and protect the interests ofour own citizens; but we recognize thoroughly our obligation to helpothers, reserving to the decision of our own Judgment the time, the place,and the method. We realize the common bond of humanity. We know theinescapable law of service.Our country has definitely refused to adopt and ratify the covenant of theLeague of Nations. We have not felt warranted in assuming theresponsibilities which its members have assumed. I am not proposing anychange in this policy; neither is the Senate. The incident, so far as weare concerned, is closed. The League exists as a foreign agency. We hope itwill be helpful. But the United States sees no reason to limit its ownfreedom and independence of action by joining it. We shall do well torecognize this basic fact in all national affairs and govern ourselvesaccordingly.WORLD COURTOur foreign policy has always been guided by two principles. The one is theavoidance of permanent political alliances which would sacrifice our properindependence. The other is the peaceful settlement of controversies betweennations. By example and by treaty we have advocated arbitration. For nearly25 years we have been a member of The Hague Tribunal, and have long soughtthe creation of a permanent World Court of Justice. I am in full accordwith both of these policies. I favor the establishment of such a courtintended to include the whole world. That is, and has long been, anAmerican policy.Pending before the Senate is a proposal that this Government give itssupport to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which is a new andsomewhat different plan. This is not a partisan question. It should notassume an artificial importance. The court is merely a convenientinstrument of adjustment to which we could go, but to which we could notbe brought. It should be discussed with entire candor, not by a politicalbut by a judicial method, without pressure and without prejudice.Partisanship has no place in our foreign relations. As I wish to see acourt established, and as the proposal presents the only practical plan onwhich many nations have ever agreed, though it may not meet every desire, Itherefore commend it to the favorable consideration of the Senate, with theproposed reservations clearly indicating our refusal to adhere to theLeague of Nations.RUSSIAOur diplomatic relations, lately so largely interrupted, are now beingresumed, but Russia presents notable difficulties. We have every desire tosee that great people, who are our traditional friends, restored to theirposition among the nations of the earth. We have relieved their pitiabledestitution with an enormous charity. Our Government offers no objectionto the carrying on of commerce by our citizens with the people of Russia.Our Government does not propose, however, to enter into relations withanother regime which refuses to recognize the sanctity of internationalobligations. I do not propose to barter away for the privilege of trade anyof the cherished rights of humanity. I do not propose to make merchandiseof any American principles. These rights and principles must go whereverthe sanctions of our Government go.But while the favor of America is not for sale, I am willing to make verylarge concessions for the purpose of rescuing the people of Russia. Alreadyencouraging evidences of returning to the ancient ways of society can bedetected. But more are needed. Whenever there appears any disposition tocompensate our citizens who were despoiled, and to recognize that debtcontracted with our Government, not by the Czar, but by the newly formedRepublic of Russia; whenever the active spirit of enmity to ourinstitutions is abated; whenever there appear works mete for repentance;our country ought to be the first to go to the economic and moral rescue ofRussia. We have every desire to help and no desire to injure. We hope thetime is near at hand when we can act.DEBTSThe current debt and interest due from foreign Governments, exclusive ofthe British debt of $4,600,000,000, is about $7,200,000,000. I do not favorthe cancellation of this debt, but I see no objection to adjusting it inaccordance with the principle adopted for the British debt. Our countrywould not wish to assume the role of an oppressive creditor, but wouldmaintain the principle that financial obligations between nations arelikewise moral obligations which international faith and honor requireshould be discharged.Our Government has a liquidated claim against Germany for the expense ofthe army of occupation of over $255,000,000. Besides this, the Mixed ClaimsCommission have before them about 12,500 claims of American citizens,aggregating about $1,225,000,000. These claims have already been reduced bya recent decision, but there are valid claims reaching well toward$500,000,000. Our thousands of citizens with credits due them of hundredsof millions of dollars have no redress save in the action of ourGovernment. These are very substantial interests, which it is the duty ofour Government to protect as best it can. That course I propose to pursue.It is for these reasons that we have a direct interest in the economicrecovery of Europe. They are enlarged by our desire for the stability ofcivilization and the welfare of humanity. That we are making sacrifices tothat end none can deny. Our deferred interest alone amounts to a milliondollars every day. But recently we offered to aid with our advice andcounsel. We have reiterated our desire to see France paid and Germanyrevived. We have proposed disarmament. We have earnestly sought to composedifferences and restore peace. We shall persevere in well doing, not byforce, but by reason.FOREIGN PAPERSUnder the law the papers pertaining to foreign relations to be printed aretransmitted as a part of this message. Other volumes of these papers willfollow.FOREIGN SERVICEThe foreign service of our Government needs to be reorganized andimproved.FISCAL CONDITIONOur main problems are domestic problems. Financial stability is the firstrequisite of sound government. We can not escape the effect of worldconditions. We can not avoid the inevitable results of the economicdisorders which have reached all nations. But we shall diminish their harmto us in proportion as we continue to restore our Government finances to asecure and endurable position. This we can and must do. Upon that firmfoundation rests the only hope of progress and prosperity. From that sourcemust come relief for the people.This is being, accomplished by a drastic but orderly retrenchment, which isbringing our expenses within our means. The origin of this has been thedetermination of the American people, the main support has been the courageof those in authority, and the effective method has been the Budget System.The result has involved real sacrifice by department heads, but it has beenmade without flinching. This system is a law of the Congress. It representsyour will. It must be maintained, and ought to be strengthened by theexample of your observance. Without a Budget System there can be no fixedresponsibility and no constructive scientific economy.This great concentration of effort by the administration and Congress hasbrought the expenditures, exclusive of the self supporting Post. OfficeDepartment, down to three billion dollars. It is possible, in consequence,to make a large reduction in the taxes of the people, which is the soleobject of all curtailment. This is treated at greater length in the Budgetmessage, and a proposed plan has been presented in detail in a statement bythe Secretary of the Treasury which has my unqualified approval. Iespecially commend a decrease on earned incomes, and further abolition ofadmission, message, and nuisance taxes. The amusement and educationalvalue of moving pictures ought not to be taxed. Diminishing charges againstmoderate incomes from investment will afford immense relief, while arevision of the surtaxes will not only provide additional money for capitalinvestment, thus stimulating industry and employing more but will notgreatly reduce the revenue from that source, and may in the future actuallyincrease it.Being opposed to war taxes in time of peace, I am not in favor ofexcess profits taxes. A very great service could be rendered throughimmediate enactment of legislation relieving the people of some of theburden of taxation. To reduce war taxes is to give every home a betterchance.For seven years the people have borne with uncomplaining courage thetremendous burden of national and local taxation. These must both bereduced. The taxes of the Nation must be reduced now as much as prudencewill permit, and expenditures must be reduced accordingly. High taxes reacheverywhere and burden everybody. They gear most heavily upon the poor. Theydiminish industry and commerce. They make agriculture unprofitable. Theyincrease the rates on transportation. They are a charge on every necessaryof life. Of all services which the Congress can render to the country, Ihave no hesitation in declaring t neglect it, to postpone it, to obstructit by unsound proposals, is to become unworthy of public confidence anduntrue to public trust. The country wants this measure to have the right ofway over an others.Another reform which is urgent in our fiscal system is the abolition of theright to issue tax exempt securities. The existing system not only permitsa large amount of the wealth of the Notion to escape its just burden butacts as a continual stimulant to municipal extravagance. This should beprohibited by constitutional amendment. All the wealth of the Nation oughtto contribute its fair share to the expenses of the Nation.TARIFF TAWThe present tariff law has accomplished its two main objects. It hassecured an abundant revenue and been productive of an abounding prosperity.Under it the country has had a very large export and import trade. Aconstant revision of the tariff by the Congress is disturbing and harmful.The present law contains an elastic provision authorizing the President toincrease or decrease present schedules not in excess of 50 per centum tomeet the difference in cost of production at home and abroad. This doesnot, to my mind, warrant a rewriting g of the whole law, but does mean, andwill be so administered, that whenever the required investigation showsthat inequalities of sufficient importance exist in any schedule, the powerto change them should and will be applied.SHIPPINGThe entire well being of our country is dependent upon transportation bysea and land. Our Government during the war acquired a large merchant fleetwhich should be transferred, as soon as possible, to private ownership andoperation under conditions which would secure two results: First, and ofprime importance, adequate means for national defense; second, adequateservice to American commerce. Until shipping conditions are such that ourfleet can be disposed of advantageously under these conditions, it will beoperated as economically as possible under such plans as may be devisedfrom time to time by the Shipping Board. We must have a merchant marinewhich meets these requirements, and we shall have to pay the cost of itsservice.PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTSThe time has come to resume in a moderate way the opening of ourintracoastal waterways; the control of flood waters of the Mississippi andof the Colorado Rivers; the improvement of the waterways from the GreatLakes toward the Gulf of Mexico; and the development of the great power andnavigation project of the St. Lawrence River, for which efforts are nowbeing made to secure the necessary treaty with Canada. These projects cannot all be undertaken at once, but all should have the immediateconsideration of the Congress and be adopted as fast as plans can bematured and the necessary funds become available. This is not incompatiblewith economy, for their nature does not require so much a publicexpenditure as a capital investment which will be reproductive, asevidenced by the marked increase in revenue from the Panama Canal. Uponthese projects depend much future industrial and agricultural progress.They represent the protection of large areas from flood and the addition ofa great amount of cheap power and cheap freight by use of navigation, chiefof which is the bringing of ocean going ships to the Great Lakes.Another problem of allied character is the superpower development of theNortheastern States, consideration of which is growing under the directionof the Department of Commerce by joint conference with the localauthorities.RAILROADSCriticism of the railroad law has been directed, first, to the sectionlaying down the rule by which rates are fixed, and providing for payment tothe Government and use of excess earnings; second, to the method for theadjustment of wage scales; and third, to the authority permittingconsolidations.It has been erroneously assumed that the act undertakes to guaranteerailroad earnings. The law requires that rates should be just andreasonable. That has always been the rule under which rates have beenfixed. To make a rate that does not yield a fair return results inconfiscation, and confiscatory rates are of course unconstitutional. Unlessthe Government adheres to the rule of making a rate that will yield a fairreturn, it must abandon rate making altogether. The new and importantfeature of that part of the law is the recapture and redistribution ofexcess rates. The constitutionality of this method is now before theSupreme Court for adjudication. Their decision should be awaited beforeattempting further legislation on this subject. Furthermore, the importanceof this feature will not be great if consolidation goes into effect.The settlement of railroad labor disputes is a matter of grave publicconcern. The Labor Board was established to protect the public in theenjoyment of continuous service by attempting to insure justice between thecompanies and their employees. It has been a great help, but is notaltogether satisfactory to the public, the employees, or the companies. Ifa substantial agreement can be reached among the groups interested, thereshould be no hesitation in enacting such agreement into law. If it is notreached, the Labor Board may very well be left for the present to protectthe public welfare.The law for consolidations is not sufficiently effective to be expeditious.Additional legislation is needed giving authority for voluntaryconsolidations, both regional and route, and providing Government machineryto aid and stimulate such action, always subject to the approval of theInterstate Commerce Commission. This should authorize the commission toappoint committees for each proposed group, representing the public and thecomponent roads, with power to negotiate with individual security holdersfor an exchange of their securities for those of the, consolidation on suchterms and conditions as the commission may prescribe for avoiding anyconfiscation and preserving fair values. Should this permissiveconsolidation prove ineffective after a limited period, the authority ofthe Government will have to be directly invoked.Consolidation appears to be the only feasible method for the maintenance ofan adequate system of transportation with an opportunity so to adjustfreight rates as to meet such temporary conditions as now prevail in someagricultural sections. Competent authorities agree that an entirereorganization of the rate structure for freight is necessary. This shouldbe ordered at once by the Congress.DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEAs no revision of the laws of the United States has been made since 1878, acommission or committee should be created to undertake this work. TheJudicial Council reports that two more district judges are needed in thesouthern district of New York, one in the northern district of Georgia, andtwo more circuit judges in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the EighthCircuit. Legislation should be considered for this purpose.It is desirable to expedite the hearing and disposal of cases. Acommission of Federal judges and lawyers should be created to recommendlegislation by which the procedure in the Federal trial courts may besimplified and regulated by rules of court, rather than by statute; suchrules to be submitted to the Congress and to be in force until annulled ormodified by the Congress. The Supreme Court needs legislation revising andsimplifying the laws governing review by that court, and enlarging theclasses of cases of too little public importance to be subject to review.Such reforms would expedite the transaction of the business of the courts.The administration of justice is likely to fail if it be long delayed.The National Government has never given adequate attention to its prisonproblems. It ought to provide employment in such forms of production as canbe used by the Government, though not sold to the public in competitionwith private business, for all prisoners who can be placed at work, and forwhich they should receive a reasonable compensation, available for theirdependents.Two independent reformatories are needed; one for the segregation of women,and another for the segregation of young men serving their first sentence.The administration of justice would be facilitated greatly by including inthe Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice a Division ofCriminal Identification, where there would be collected this informationwhich is now indispensable in the suppression of crime.PROHIBITIONThe prohibition amendment to the Constitution requires the Congress. andthe President to provide adequate laws to prevent its violation. It is myduty to enforce such laws. For that purpose a treaty is being negotiatedwith Great Britain with respect to the right of search of hoveringvessels. To prevent smuggling, the Coast Card should be greatlystrengthened, and a supply of swift power boats should be provided. Themajor sources of production should be rigidly regulated, and every effortshould be made to suppress interstate traffic. With this action on the partof the National Government, and the cooperation which is usually renderedby municipal and State authorities, prohibition should be made effective.Free government has no greater menace than disrespect for authority andcontinual violation of law. It is the duty of a citizen not only to observethe law but to let it be known that he is opposed to its violation.THE NEGRONumbered among our population are some 12,000,000 colored people. Under ourConstitution their rights are just as sacred as those of any other citizen.It is both a public and a private duty to protect those rights. TheCongress ought to exercise all its powers of prevention and punishmentagainst the hideous crime of lynching, of which the negroes are by no meansthe sole sufferers, but for which they furnish a majority of the victims.Already a considerable sum is appropriated to give the negroes vocationaltraining in agriculture. About half a million dollars is recommended formedical courses at Howard University to help contribute to the education of500 colored doctors needed each year. On account of the integration oflarge numbers into industrial centers, it has been proposed that acommission be created, composed of members from both races, to formulate abetter policy for mutual understanding and confidence. Such an effort is tobe commended. Everyone would rejoice in the accomplishment of the resultswhich it seeks. But it is well to recognize that these difficulties are toa large extent local problems which must be worked out by the mutualforbearance and human kindness of each community. Such a method gives muchmore promise of a real remedy than outside interference.CIVIL SERVICEThe maintenance and extension of the classified civil service isexceedingly important. There are nearly 550,000 persons in the executivecivil service drawing about $700,000,000 of yearly compensation.Four fifths of these are in the classified service. This method ofselection of the employees of the United States is especially desirable forthe Post Office Department. The Civil Service Commission has recommendedthat postmasters at first, second, and third class offices be classified.Such action, accompanied by a repeal of the four year term of office, wouldundoubtedly be an improvement. I also recommend that the field force forprohibition enforcement be brought within the classified civil servicewithout covering in the present membership. The best method for selectingpublic servants is the merit system.PUBLIC BUILDINGSMany of the departments in Washington need better housing facilities. Someare so crowded that their work is impeded, others are so scattered thatthey lose their identity. While I do not favor at this time a generalpublic building law, I believe it is now necessary, in accordance withplans already sanctioned for a unified and orderly system for thedevelopment of this city, to begin the carrying out of those plans byauthorizing the erection of three or four buildings most urgently needed byan annual appropriation of $5,000,000.REGULATORY LEGISLATIONCooperation with other maritime powers is necessary for complete protectionof our coast waters from pollution. Plans for this are under way, butawait certain experiments for refuse disposal. Meantime laws prohibitingspreading oil and oil refuse from vessels in our own territorial waterswould be most helpful against this menace and should be speedily enacted.Laws should be passed regulating aviation.Revision is needed of the laws regulating radio interference.Legislation and regulations establishing load liner, to provide safeloading of vessels leaving our ports are necessary and recodification ofour navigation laws is vital.Revision of procedure of the Federal Trade Commission will give moreconstructive purpose to this department.If our Alaskan fisheries are to be saved from destruction, there must befurther legislation declaring a general policy and delegating the authorityto make rules and regulations to an administrative body.ARMY AND NAVYFor several years we have been decreasing the personnel of the Army andNavy, and reducing their power to the danger point. Further reductionsshould not be made. The Army is a guarantee of the security of our citizensat home; the Navy is a guarantee of the security of our citizens abroad.Both of these services should be strengthened rather than weakened.Additional planes are needed for the Army, and additional submarines forthe Navy. The defenses of Panama must be perfected. We want no morecompetitive armaments. We want no more war. But we want no weakness thatinvites imposition. A people who neglect their national defense are puttingin jeopardy their national honor.INSULAR POSSESSIONSConditions in the insular possessions on the whole have been good. Theirbusiness has been reviving. They are being administered according to law.That effort has the full support of the administration. Suchrecommendations as may conic from their people or their governments shouldhave the most considerate attention.EDUCATION AND WELFAREOur National Government is not doing as much as it legitimately can do topromote the welfare of the people. Our enormous material wealth, ourinstitutions, our whole form of society, can not be considered fullysuccessful until their benefits reach the merit of every individual. Thisis not a suggestion that the Government should, or could, assume for thepeople the inevitable burdens of existence. There is no method by which wecan either be relieved of the results of our own folly or be guaranteed asuccessful life. There is an inescapable personal responsibility for thedevelopment of character, of industry, of thrift, and of self control.These do not come from the Government, but from the people themselves. Butthe Government can and should always be expressive of steadfastdetermination, always vigilant, to maintain conditions under which thesevirtues are most likely to develop and secure recognition and reward. Thisis the American policy.It is in accordance with this principle that we have enacted laws for theprotection of the public health and have adopted prohibition in narcoticdrugs and intoxicating liquors. For purposes of national uniformity weought to provide, by constitutional amendment and appropriate legislation,for a limitation of child labor, and in all cases under the exclusivejurisdiction of the Federal Government a minimum wage law for women, whichwould undoubtedly find sufficient power of enforcement in the influence ofpublic opinion.Having in mind that education is peculiarly a local problem, and that itshould always be pursued with the largest freedom of choice by students andparents, nevertheless, the Federal Government might well give the benefitof its counsel and encouragement more freely in this direction. If anyonedoubts the need of concerted action by the States of the Nation for thispurpose, it is only necessary to consider the appalling figures ofilliteracy representing a condition which does not vary much in all partsof the Union. I do not favor the making of appropriations from the NationalTreasury to be expended directly on local education, but I do consider it afundamental requirement of national activity which, accompanied by alliedsubjects of welfare, is worthy of a separate department and a place in theCabinet. The humanitarian side of government should not be repressed, butshould be cultivated.Mere intelligence, however, is not enough. Enlightenment must beaccompanied by that moral power which is the product of the home and ofrebellion. Real education and true welfare for the people rest inevitablyon this foundation, which the Government can approve and commend, but whichthe people themselves must create.IMMIGRATIONAmerican institutions rest solely on good citizenship. They were created bypeople who had a background of self government. New arrivals should belimited to our capacity to absorb them into the ranks of good citizenship.America must be kept American. For this purpose, it is necessary tocontinue a policy of restricted immigration. It would be well to make suchimmigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source, andbased either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization. Eithermethod would insure the admission of those with the largest capacity andbest intention of becoming citizens. I am convinced that our presenteconomic and social conditions warrant a limitation of those to beadmitted. We should find additional safety in a law requiring the immediateregistration of all aliens. Those who do not want to be partakers of theAmerican spirit ought not to settle in America.VETERANSNo more important duty falls on the Government of the United States thanthe adequate care of its veterans. Those suffering disabilities incurred inthe service must have sufficient hospital relief and compensation. Theirdependents must be supported. Rehabilitation and vocational training mustbe completed. All of this service must be clean, must be prompt andeffective, and it must be administered in a spirit of the broadest anddeepest human sympathy. If investigation reveals any present defects ofadministration or need Of legislation, orders will be given for theimmediate correction of administration, and recommendations for legislationshould be given the highest preference.At present there are 9,500 vacant beds in Government hospitals, I recommendthat all hospitals be authorized at once to receive and care for, withouthospital pay, the veterans of all wars needing such care, whenever thereare vacant beds, and that immediate steps be taken to enlarge and build newhospitals to serve all such cases.The American Legion will present to the Congress a legislative programtoo extensive for detailed discussion here. It is a carefully matured plan.While some of it I do not favor, with much of it I am in hearty accord, andI recommend that a most painstaking effort be made to provide remedies forany defects in the administration of the present laws which theirexperience has revealed. The attitude of the Government toward theseproposals should be one of generosity. But I do not favor the granting of abonus.COALThe cost of coal has become unbearably high. It places a great burden onour industrial and domestic life. The public welfare requires a reductionin the price of fuel. With the enormous deposits in existence, failure ofsupply ought not to be tolerated. Those responsible for the conditions inthis industry should undertake its reform and free it from any charge ofprofiteering.The report of the Coal Commission will be before the Congress. It comprisesall the facts. It represents the mature deliberations and conclusions ofthe best talent and experience that ever made a national survey of theproduction and distribution of fuel. I do not favor Government ownership oroperation of coal mines. The need is for action under private ownershipthat will secure greater continuity of production and greater publicprotection. The Federal Government probably has no peacetime authority toregulate wages, prices, or profits in coal at the mines or among dealers,but by ascertaining and publishing facts it can exercise great influence.The source of the difficulty in the bituminous coal fields is theintermittence of operation which causes great waste of both capital andlabor. That part of the report dealing with this problem has muchsignificance, and is suggestive of necessary remedies. By amending, the carrules, by encouraging greater unity of ownership, and possibly bypermitting common selling agents for limited districts on condition thatthey accept adequate regulations and guarantee that competition betweendistricts be unlimited, distribution, storage, and continuity ought to beimproved.The supply of coal must be constant. In case of its prospectiveinterruption, the President should have authority to appoint a commissionempowered to deal with whatever emergency situation might arise, to aidconciliation and voluntary arbitration, to adjust any existing orthreatened controversy between the employer and the employee whencollective bargaining fails, and by controlling distribution to preventprofiteering in this vital necessity. This legislation is exceedinglyurgent, and essential to the exercise of national authority for theprotection of the people. Those who undertake the responsibility ofmanagement or employment in this industry do so with the full knowledgethat the public interest is paramount, and that to fail through any motiveof selfishness in its service is such a betrayal of duty as warrantsuncompromising action by the Government.REORGANIZATIONA special joint committee has been appointed to work out a plan for areorganization of the different departments and bureaus of the Governmentmore scientific and economical than the present system. With the exceptionof the consolidation of the War and Navy Departments and some minordetails, the plan has the general sanction of the President and theCabinet. It is important that reorganization be enacted into law at thepresent session.AGRICULTUREAided by the sound principles adopted by the Government, the business ofthe country has had an extraordinary revival. Looked at as a whole, theNation is in the enjoyment of remarkable prosperity. Industry and commerceare thriving. For the most tart agriculture is successful, eleven stapleshaving risen in value from about $5,300,000,000 two years ago to about.$7,000,000,000 for the current year. But range cattle are still low inprice, and some sections of the wheat area, notably Minnesota, NorthDakota, and on west, have many cases of actual distress. With his productsnot selling on a parity with the products of industry, every sound remedythat can be devised should be applied for the relief of the farmer. Herepresents a character, a type of citizenship, and a public necessity thatmust be preserved and afforded every facility for regaining prosperity.The distress is most acute among those wholly dependent upon one crop..Wheat acreage was greatly expanded and has not yet been sufficientlyreduced. A large amount is raised for export, which has to meet thecompetition in the world market of large amounts raised on land muchcheaper and much more productive.No complicated scheme of relief, no plan for Government fixing of prices,no resort to the public Treasury will be of any permanent value inestablishing agriculture. Simple and direct methods put into operation bythe farmer himself are the only real sources for restoration.Indirectly the farmer must be relieved by a reduction of national and localtaxation. He must be assisted by the reorganization of the freight ratestructure which could reduce charges on his production. To make this fullyeffective there ought to be railroad consolidations. Cheaper fertilizersmust be provided.He must have organization. His customer with whom he exchanges products ohe farm for those of industry is organized, labor is organized, business isorganized, and there is no way for agriculture to meet this unless it, too,is organized. The acreage of wheat is too large. Unless we can meet theworld market at a profit, we must stop raising for export. Organizationwould help to reduce acreage. Systems of cooperative marketing created bythe farmers themselves, supervised by competent management, without doubtwould be of assistance, but, the can not wholly solve the problem. Ouragricultural schools ought to have thorough courses in the theory oforganization and cooperative marketing.Diversification is necessary. Those farmers who raise their living on theirland are not greatly in distress. Such loans as are wisely needed to assistbuying stock and other materials to start in this direction should befinanced through a Government agency as a temporary and emergencyexpedient.The remaining difficulty is the disposition of exportable wheat. I do notfavor the permanent interference of the Government in this problem. Thatprobably would increase the trouble by increasing production. But it seemsfeasible to provide Government assistance to exports, and authority shouldbe given the War Finance Corporation to grant, in its discretion, the mostliberal terms of payment for fats and grains exported for the directbenefit of the farm.MUSCLE SHOALSThe Government is undertaking to develop a great water power project knownas Muscle Shoals, on which it has expended many million dollars. The workis still going on. Subject to the right to retake in time of war, Irecommend that this property with a location for auxiliary steam plant andrights of way be sold. This would end the present burden of expense andshould return to the Treasury the largest price possible to secure.While the price is an important element, there is another considerationeven more compelling. The agriculture of the Nation needs a greater supplyand lower cost of fertilizer. This is now imported in large quantities. Thebest information I can secure indicates that present methods of powerproduction would not be able profitably to meet the price at which theseimports can be sold. To obtain a supply from this water power would requirelong and costly experimentation to perfect a process for cheap production.Otherwise our purpose would fail completely. It seems desirable, therefore,in order to protect and promote the public welfare, to have adequatecovenants that such experimentation be made and carried on to success. Thegreat advantage of low priced nitrates must be secured for the directbenefit of the farmers and the indirect benefit of the public in time ofpeace, and of the Government in time of war. If this main object beaccomplished, the amount of money received for the property is not aprimary or major consideration.Such a solution will involve complicated negotiations, and there is noauthority for that purpose. I therefore recommend that the Congressappoint a small joint committee to consider offers, conduct negotiations,and report definite recommendations.RECLAMATIONBy reason of many contributing causes, occupants of our reclamationprojects are in financial difficulties, which in some cases are acute.Relief should be granted by definite authority of law empowering theSecretary of the Interior in his discretion to suspend, readjust, andreassess all charges against water users. This whole question is beingconsidered by experts. You will have the advantage of the facts andconclusions which they may develop. This situation, involving a Governmentinvestment of more than $135,000,000, and affecting more than 30,000 waterusers, is serious. While relief which is necessary should be granted, yetcontracts with the Government which can be met should be met. Theestablished general policy of these projects should not be abandoned forany private control.HIGHWAYS AND FORESTSHighways and reforestation should continue to have the interest and supportof the Government. Everyone is anxious for good highways. I have made aliberal proposal in the Budget for the continuing payment to the States bythe Federal Government of its share for this necessary public improvement.No expenditure of public money contributes so much to the national wealthas for building good roads.Reforestation has an importance far above the attention it usually secures.A special committee of the Senate is investigating this need, and I shallwelcome a constructive policy based on their report.It is 100 years since our country announced the Monroe doctrine. Thisprinciple has been ever since, and is now, one of the main foundations ofour foreign relations. It must be maintained. But in maintaining it we mustnot be forgetful that a great change has taken place. We are no longer aweak Nation, thinking mainly of defense, dreading foreign imposition. Weare great and powerful. New powers bring new responsibilities. Our dittythen was to protect ourselves. Added to that, our duty now is to help givestability to the world. We want idealism. We want that vision which liftsmen and nations above themselves. These are virtues by reason of their ownmerit. But they must not be cloistered; they must not be impractical; theymust not be ineffective.The world has had enough of the curse of hatred and selfishness, ofdestruction and war. It has had enough of the wrongful use of materialpower. For the healing of the nations there must be good will and charity,confidence and peace. The time has come for a more practical use of moralpower, and more reliance upon the principle that right makes its own might.Our authority among the nations must be represented by justice and mercy.It is necessary not only to have faith, but to make sacrifices for ourfaith. The spiritual forces of the world make all its final determinations.It is with these voices that America should speak. Whenever they declare arighteous purpose there need be no doubt that they will be heard. Americahas taken her place in the world as a Republic free, independent,powerful. The best service that can be rendered to humanity is theassurance that this place will be maintained.
Calvin Coolidge
To the Congress of the United States:The present state of the Union, upon which it is customary for thePresident to report to the Congress under the provisions of theConstitution, is such that it may be regarded with encouragement andsatisfaction by every American. Our country is almost unique in its abilityto discharge fully and promptly all its obligations at home and abroad, andprovide for all its inhabitants an increase in material resources, inintellectual vigor and in moral power. The Nation holds a positionunsurpassed in all former human experience. This does not mean that we donot have any problems. It is elementary that the increasing breadth of ourexperience necessarily increases the problems of our national life. But itdoes mean that if all will but apply ourselves industriously and honestly,we have ample powers with which to meet our problems and provide for I heirspeedy solution. I do not profess that we can secure an era of perfectionin human existence, but we can provide an era of peace and prosperity,attended with freedom and justice and made more and more satisfying by theministrations of the charities and humanities of life.Our domestic problems are for the most part economic. We have our enormousdebt to pay, and we are paying it. We have the high cost of government todiminish, and we are diminishing it. We have a heavy burden of taxation toreduce, and we are reducing it. But while remarkable progress has been madein these directions, the work is yet far from accomplished. We still oweover $21,000,000,000, the cost of the National Government is still about$3,500,000,000, and the national taxes still amount to about $27 for eachone of our inhabitants. There yet exists this enormous field for theapplication of economy.In my opinion the Government can do more to remedy the economic ills of thepeople by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can beaccomplished through any other action. The costs of our national and localgovernments combined now stand at a sum close to $100 for each inhabitantof the land. A little less than one third of this is represented bynational expenditure, and a little more than two thirds by localexpenditure. It is an ominous fact that only the National Government isreducing its debt. Others are increasing theirs at about $1,000,000,000each year. The depression that overtook business, the disaster experiencedin agriculture, the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in allvalues which our country experienced in a most acute form in 1920, resultedin no small measure from the prohibitive taxes which were then levied onall productive effort. The establishment of a system of drastic economy inpublic expenditure, which has enabled us to pay off about one fifth of thenational debt since 1919, and almost cut in two the national tax burdensince 1921, has been one of the main causes in reestablishing a prosperitywhich has come to include within its benefits almost every one of ourinhabitants. Economy reaches everywhere. It carries a blessing toeverybody.The fallacy of the claim that the costs of government are borne by the richand those who make a direct contribution to the National Treasury can notbe too often exposed. No system has been devised, I do not think any systemcould be devised, under which any person living in this country couldescape being affected by the cost of our government. It has a direct effectboth upon the rate and the purchasing power of wages. It is felt in theprice of those prime necessities of existence, food, clothing, fuel andshelter. It would appear to be elementary that the more the Governmentexpends the more it must require every producer to contribute out of hisproduction to the Public Treasury, and the less he will have for his ownbenefit. The continuing costs of public administration can be met in onlyone way by the work of the people. The higher they become, the more thepeople must work for the Government. The less they are, the more the peoplecan work for themselves.The present estimated margin between public receipts and expenditures forthis fiscal year is very small. Perhaps the most important work that thissession of the Congress can do is to continue a policy of economy andfurther reduce the cost of government, in order that we may have areduction of taxes for the next fiscal year. Nothing is more likely toproduce that public confidence which is the forerunner and the mainstay ofprosperity, encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ampleopportunity for employment at good wages, provide a larger market foragricultural products, and put our country in a stronger position to beable to meet the world competition in trade, than a continuing policy ofeconomy. Of course necessary costs must be met, proper functions of theGovernment performed, and constant investments for capital account andreproductive effort must be carried on by our various departments. But thepeople must know that their Government is placing upon them no unnecessaryburden.TAXESEveryone desires a reduction of taxes, and there is a great preponderanceof sentiment in favor of taxation reform. When I approved the present taxlaw, I stated publicly that I did so in spite of certain provisions which Ibelieved unwise and harmful. One of the most glaring of these was themaking public of the amounts assessed against different income tax payers.Although that damage has now been done, I believe its continuation to bedetrimental To the public welfare and bound to decrease public revenues, sothat it ought to be repealed.Anybody can reduce taxes, but it is not so easy to stand in the gap andresist the passage of increasing appropriation bills which would make taxreduction impossible. It will be very easy to measure the strength of theattachment to reduced taxation by the power with which increasedappropriations are resisted. If at the close of the present session theCongress has kept within the budget which I propose to present, it willthen be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the taxreform that the Congress may wish for during the next fiscal year. Thecountry is now feeling the direct stimulus which came from the passage ofthe last revenue bill, and under the assurance of a reasonable system oftaxation there is every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedentedproportions. But it would be idle to expect any such results unlessbusiness can continue free from excess profits taxation and be accorded asystem of surtaxes at rates which have for their object not the punishmentof success or the discouragement of business, but the production of thegreatest amount of revenue from large incomes. I am convinced that thelarger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to theGovernment if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward.Moreover the effect of the present method of this taxation is to increasethe cost of interest on productive enterprise and to increase the burdenof rent. It is altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage andstimulate investment that it would firmly establish our country in theeconomic leadership of the world.WATERWAYSMeantime our internal development should go on. Provision should be madefor flood control of such rivers as the Mississippi and the Colorado, andfor the opening up of our inland waterways to commerce. Consideration isdue to the project of better navigation from the Great Lakes to the Gulf.Every effort is being made to promote an agreement with Canada to buildthe, St. Lawrence waterway. There are pending before the Congress bills forfurther development of the Mississippi Basin, for the taking over of theCape Cod Canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seems to havebeen incurred during the war, and for the improvement of harbors on boththe Pacific and the Atlantic coasts. While this last should be divested ofsome of its projects and we must proceed slowly, these bills in generalhave my approval. Such works are productive of wealth and in the long runtend to a reduction of the tax burden.RECLAMATIONOur country has a well defined policy of reclamation established understatutory authority. This policy should be continued and made aself sustaining activity administered in a manner that will meet localrequirements and bring our and lands into a profitable state of cultivationas fast as there is a market for their products. Legislation is pendingbased on the report of the Fact Finding Commission for the proper relief ofthose needing extension of time in which to meet their payments onirrigated land, and for additional amendments and reforms of ourreclamation laws, which are all exceedingly important and should be enactedat once.No more important development has taken place in the last year than thebeginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition. Wemust permit no division of classes in this country, with one occupationstriving to secure advantage over another. Each must proceed under openopportunities and with a fair prospect of economic equality. The Governmentcan not successfully insure prosperity or fix prices by legislative fiat.Every business has its risk and its times of depression. It is well knownthat in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a moresatisfactory range of prices under the natural working out of economic lawsthan when the Government undertakes the artificial support of markets andindustries. Still we can so order our affairs, so protect our own peoplefrom foreign competition, so arrange our national finances, so administerour monetary system, so provide for the extension of credits, so improvemethods of distribution, as to provide a better working machinery for thetransaction of the business of the Nation with the least possible frictionand loss. The Government has been constantly increasing its efforts inthese directions for the relief and permanent establishment of agricultureon a sound and equal basis with other business.It is estimated that the value of the crops for this harvest year may reach$13,000,000,000, which is an increase of over $3,000,000,000 in threeyears. It compares with $7,100,000,000 in 1913, and if we make deductionfrom the figures of 1924 for the comparatively decreased value of thedollar, the yield this year still exceeds 1913 in purchasing power by over$1,000,000,000, and in this interval there has been no increase in thenumber of farmers. Mostly by his own effort the farmer has decreased thecost of production. A marked increase in the price of his products and somedecrease in the price of his supplies has brought him about to a paritywith the rest of the Nation. The crop area of this season is estimated at370,000,000 acres, which is a decline of 3,000,000 acres from last year,and 6,000,000 acres from 1919. This has been a normal and naturalapplication of economic laws, which has placed agriculture on a foundationwhich is undeniably sound and beginning to be satisfactory.A decrease in the world supply of wheat has resulted in a very largeincrease in the price of that commodity. The position of all agriculturalproducts indicates a better balanced supply, but we can not yet concludethat agriculture is recovered from the effects of the war period or that itis permanently on a prosperous basis. The cattle industry has not yetrecovered and in some sections has been suffering from dry weather. Everyeffort must be made both by Government activity and by private agencies torestore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship withother industries.It was on account of past depression, and in spite of present moreencouraging conditions, that I have assembled an Agricultural Conferencemade up of those who are representative of this great industry in both itsoperating and economic sides. Everyone knows that the great need of thefarmers is markets. The country is not suffering on the side of production.Almost the entire difficulty is on the side of distribution. This reachesback, of course, to unit costs and diversification, and many alliedsubjects. It is exceedingly intricate, for our domestic and foreign trade,transportation and banking, and in fact our entire economic system, areclosely related to it. In time for action at this session, I hope to reportto the Congress such legislative remedies as the conference may recommend.An appropriation should be made to defray their necessary expenses.MUSCLE SHOALSThe production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosives in war ismore and more important. It is one of the chief sustaining elements oflife. It is estimated that soil exhaustion each year is represented byabout 9,000,000 tons and replenishment by 5,450,000 tons. The deficit of3,550,000 tons is reported to represent the impairment of 118,000,000 acresof farm lands each year.To meet these necessities the Government has been developing a water powerproject at Muscle Shoals to be equipped to produce nitrogen for explosivesand fertilizer. It is my opinion that the support of agriculture is thechief problem to consider in connection with this property. It could by nomeans supply the present needs for nitrogen, but it would help and itsdevelopment would encourage bringing other water powers into like use.Several offers have been made for the purchase of this property. Probablynone of them represent final terms. Much costly experimentation isnecessary to produce commercial nitrogen. For that reason it is a fieldbetter suited to private enterprise than to Government operation. I shouldfavor a sale of this property, or long time lease, tinder rigid guarantiesof commercial nitrogen production at reasonable prices for agriculturaluse. There would be a surplus of power for many years over any possibilityof its application to a developing manufacture of nitrogen. It may be foundadvantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with suchreservations as will allow its gradual withdrawal and application tonitrogen manufacture. A subcommittee of the Committees on Agricultureshould investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchasers. Ifno advantageous offer be made, the development should continue and theplant should be dedicated primarily to the production of materials for thefertilization of the soil.RAILWAYSThe railways during the past year have made still further progress inrecuperation from the war, with large rains in efficiency and abilityexpeditiously to handle the traffic of the country. We have now passedthrough several periods of peak traffic without the car shortages which sofrequently in the past have brought havoc to our agriculture andindustries. The condition of many of our great freight terminals is stillone of difficulty and results in imposing, large costs on the public forinward bound freight, and on the railways for outward bound freight. Owingto the growth of our large cities and the great increase in the volume oftraffic, particularly in perishables, the problem is not only difficult ofsolution, but in some cases not wholly solvable by railway action alone.In my message last year I emphasized the necessity for further legislationwith a view to expediting the consolidation of our rail ways into largersystems. The principle of Government control of rates and profits, nowthoroughly imbedded in our governmental attitude toward natural monopoliessuch as the railways, at once eliminates the need of competition by smallunits as a method of rate adjustment. Competition must be preserved as astimulus to service, but this will exist and can be increased tinderenlarged systems. Consequently the consolidation of the railways intolarger units for the purpose of securing the substantial values to thepublic which will come from larger operation has been the logicalconclusion of Congress in its previous enactments, and is also supported bythe best opinion in the country. Such consolidation will assure not only agreater element of competition as to service, but it will afford economy inoperation, greater stability in railway earnings, and more economicalfinancing. It opens large possibilities of better equalization of ratesbetween different classes of traffic so as to relieve undue burdens uponagricultural products and raw materials generally, which are now notpossible without ruin to small units owing to the lack of diversity oftraffic. It would also tend to equalize earnings in such fashion as toreduce the importance of section 15A, at which criticism, often misapplied,has been directed. A smaller number of units would offer less difficultiesin labor adjustments and would contribute much to the, solution of terminaldifficulties.The consolidations need to be carried out with due regard to publicinterest and to the rights and established life of various communities inour country. It does not seem to me necessary that we endeavor toanticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeableproject which shall stipulate a fixed number of systems, but rather weought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that it can beworked out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration ofpublic interest. Whether the number of ultimate systems shall be more orless seems to me can only be determined by time and actual experience inthe development of such consolidations.Those portions of the present law contemplating consolidations ore not,sufficiently effective in producing expeditious action and needamplification of the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission,particularly in affording a period for voluntary proposals to thecommission and in supplying Government pressure to secure action after theexpiration of such a period.There are other proposals before Congress for amending the transportationacts. One of these contemplates a revision of the method of valuation forrate making purposes to be followed by a renewed valuation of the railways.The valuations instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission 10 yearsago have not yet been completed. They have cost the Government an enormoussum, and they have imposed great expenditure upon the railways, most ofwhich has in effect come out of the public in increased rates. This workshould not be abandoned or supplanted until its results are known and canbe considered.Another matter before the Congress is legislation affecting the laborsections of the transportation act. Much criticism has been directed at theworkings of this section and experience has shown that some usefulamendment could be made to these provisions.It would be helpful if a plan could be adopted which, while retaining thepractice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntaryarbitration of labor differences, could also provide simplicity inrelations and more direct local responsibility of employees and managers.But such legislation will not meet the requirements of the situation unlessit recognizes the principle that t e public has a right to theuninterrupted service of transportation, and therefore a right to be heardwhen there is danger that the Nation may suffer great injury through theinterruption of operations because of labor disputes. If these elements arenot comprehended in proposed legislation, it would be better to gainfurther experience with the present organization for dealing with thesequestions before undertaking a change.SHIPPING BOARDThe form of the organization of the Shipping Board was based originally onits functions as a semi judicial body in regulation of rates. During thewar it was loaded with enormous administrative duties. It has beendemonstrated time and again that this form of organization results inindecision, division of opinion and administrative functions, which make awholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great businessenterprise. The first principle in securing the objective set out byCongress in building up the American merchant marine upon the great traderoutes and subsequently disposing of it into private operation can notproceed with effectiveness until the entire functions of the board arereorganized. The immediate requirement is to transfer into the EmergencyFleet, Corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet andother property, leaving to the Shipping Board solely the duty ofdetermining certain major policies which require deliberative action.The procedure under section 28 of the merchant marine act has created greatdifficulty and threatened friction during the past 12 months. Its attemptedapplication developed not only great opposition from exporters,particularly as to burdens that may be imposed upon agricultural products,but also great anxiety in the different seaports as to the effect upontheir relative rate structures. This trouble will certainly recur if actionis attempted under this section. It is uncertain in some of its terms andof great difficulty in interpretation.It is my belief that action under this section should be suspended untilthe Congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of theexperience that has been developed since its enactment.NATIONAL ELECTIONSNothing is so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form ofgovernment as honesty in all that relates to the conduct of elections. I amof the opinion that the national laws governing the choice of members ofthe Congress should be extended to include appropriate representation ofthe respective parties at the ballot box ant equality of representation onthe various registration boards, wherever they exist.THE JUDICIARYThe docket of the Supreme Court is becoming congested. At the opening termlast year it had 592 cases, while this year it had 687 cases. Justice longdelayed is justice refused. Unless the court be given power by preliminaryand summary consideration to determine the importance of cases, and bydisposing of those which are not of public moment reserve its time for themore extended consideration of the remainder, the congestion of the docketis likely to increase. It is also desirable that Supreme Court should havepower to improve and reform procedure in suits at law in the Federal courtsthrough the adoption of appropriate rules. The Judiciary Committee of theSenate has reported favorably upon two bills providing for these reformswhich should have the immediate favorable consideration of the Congress.I further recommend that provision be made for the appointment of acommission, to consist of two or three members of the Federal judiciary andas many members of the bar, to examine the present criminal code ofprocedure and recommend to the Congress measures which may reform andexpedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of ourcriminal laws.PRISON REFORMPending before the Congress is a bill which has already passed one Houseproviding for a reformatory to which could be committed first offenders andyoung men for the purpose of segregating them from contact with bannedcriminals and providing them with special training in order to reestablishin them the power to pursue a law abiding existence in the social andeconomic life of the Nation. This is a matter of so much importance as towarrant the early attention of the present session. Further provisionshould also be made, for a like reason, for a separate reformatory forwomen.NATIONAL POLICE BUREAURepresentatives of the International Police Conference will bring to t eattention of the Congress a proposal for the establishment of a nationalpolice bureau. Such action would provide a central point for gathering,compiling, and later distributing to local police authorities muchinformation which would be helpful in the prevention and detection ofcrime. I believe this bureau is needed, and I recommend favorableconsideration of this proposal.DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WELFAREThe welfare work of the District of Columbia is administered by severaldifferent boards dealing with charities and various correctional efforts.It would be an improvement if this work were consolidated and placed underthe direction of a single commission.FRENCH SPOLIATION CLAIMSDuring the last session of the Congress legislation was introduced lookingto the payment of the remaining claims generally referred to as the Frenchspoliation claims. The Congress has provided for the payment of manysimilar claims. Those that remain unpaid have been long pending. Thebeneficiaries thereunder have every reason to expect payment. These claimshave been examined by the Court of Claims and their validity and amountdetermined. The United States ought to pay its debts. I recommend action bythe Congress which will permit of the payment of these remaining claims.THE WAGE EARNERTwo very important policies have been adopted by this country which, whileextending their benefits also in other directions, have been of the utmostimportance to the wage earners. One of these is the protective tariff,which enables our people to live according to a better standard and receivea better rate of compensation than any people, any time, anywhere on earth,ever enjoyed. This saves the American market for the products of theAmerican workmen. The other is a policy of more recent origin and seeks toshield our wage earners from the disastrous competition of a great influxof foreign peoples. This has been done by the restrictive immigration law.This saves the American job for the American workmen. I should like to seethe administrative features of this law rendered a little more humane forthe purpose of permitting those already here a greater latitude in securingadmission of members of their own families. But I believe this law inprinciple is necessary and sound, and destined to increase greatly thepublic welfare. We must maintain our own economic position, we must defendour own national integrity.It is gratifying to report that the progress of industry, the enormousincrease in individual productivity through labor saving devices, and thehigh rate of wages have all combined to furnish our people in general withsuch an abundance not only of the necessaries but of the conveniences oflife that we are by a natural evolution solving our problems of economicand social justice.THE NEGROThese developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in thecondition of the negro race. Gradually, but surely, with the almostuniversal sympathy of those among whom they live, the colored people areworking out their own destiny. I firmly believe that it is better for allconcerned that they should be cheerfully accorded their full constitutionalrights, that they should be protected from all of those impositions towhich, from their position, they naturally fall a prey, especially from thecrime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement tobecome full partakers in all the blessings of our common Americancitizenship.CIVIL SERVICEThe merit system has long been recognized as the correct basis foremployment in our, civil service. I believe that first second, and thirdclass postmasters, and without covering in the present membership thefield force of prohibition enforcement, should be brought within theclassified service by statute law. Otherwise the Executive order of oneadministration is changed by the Executive order of another administration,and little real progress is made. Whatever its defects, the merit system iscertainly to be preferred to the spoils system.DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATIONOne way to save public money would be to pass the pending bill for thereorganization of the various departments. This project has been pendingfor some time, and has had the most careful consideration of experts andthe thorough study of a special congressional committee. This legislationis vital as a companion piece to the Budget law. Legal authority for athorough reorganization of the Federal structure with some latitude ofaction to the Executive in the rearrangement of secondary functions wouldmake for continuing economy in the shift of government activities whichmust follow every change in a developing country. Beyond this many of theindependent agencies of the Government must be placed under responsibleCabinet officials, if we are to have safeguards of efficiency, economy, andprobity.ARMY AND NAVYLittle has developed in relation to our national defense which needsspecial attention. Progress is constantly being made in air navigation andrequires encouragement and development. Army aviators have made asuccessful trip around the world, for which I recommend suitablerecognition through provisions for promotion, compensation, and retirement.Under the direction of the Navy a new Zeppelin has been successfullybrought from Europe across the Atlantic to our own country.Due to the efficient supervision of the Secretary of War the Army of theUnited States has been organized with a small body of Regulars and amoderate National Guard and Reserve. The defense test of September 12demonstrated the efficiency of the operating plans. These methods andoperations are well worthy of congressional support.Under the limitation of armaments treaty a large saving in outlay and aconsiderable decrease in maintenance of the Navy has been accomplished. Weshould maintain the policy of constantly working toward the full treatystrength of the Navy. Careful investigation is being made in thisdepartment of the relative importance of aircraft, surface and submarinevessels, in order that we may not fail to take advantage of all modernimprovements for our national defense. A special commission also isinvestigating the problem of petroleum oil for the Navy, considering thebest policy to insure the future supply of fuel oil and prevent thethreatened drainage of naval oil reserves. Legislative action is requiredto carry on experiments in oil shale reduction, as large deposits of thistype have been set aside for the use of the Navy.We have been constantly besought to engage in competitive armaments.Frequent reports will reach us of the magnitude of the military equipmentof other, nations. We shall do well to be little impressed by such reportsor such actions. Any nation undertaking to maintain a militaryestablishment with aggressive and imperialistic designs will find itselfseverely handicapped in the economic development of the world. I believethoroughly in the Army and Navy, in adequate defense and preparation. But Iam opposed to any policy of competition in building and maintaining land orsea armaments.Our country has definitely relinquished the old standard of dealing withother countries by terror and force, and is definitely committed to the newstandard of dealing with them through friendship and understanding. Thisnew policy should be constantly kept in mind by the guiding forces of theArmy and Navy, by the. Congress and by the country at large. I believe itholds a promise of great benefit to humanity. I shall resist any attempt toresort to the old methods and the old standards. I am especially solicitousthat foreign nations should comprehend the candor and sincerity with whichwe have adopted this position. While we propose to maintain defensive andsupplementary police forces by land and sea, and to train them throughinspections and maneuvers upon appropriate occasions in order to maintaintheir efficiency, I wish every other nation to understand that this doesnot express any unfriendliness or convey any hostile intent. I want thearmed forces of America to be considered by all peoples not as enemies butas friends as the contribution which is made by this country for themaintenance of the peace and security of the world.VETERANSWith the authorization for general hospitalization of the veterans of allwars provided during the present year, the care and treatment of those whohave served their country in time of peril and the attitude of theGovernment toward them is not now so much one of needed legislation as oneof careful, generous and humane administration. It will ever be recognizedthat their welfare is of the first concern and always entitled to the mostsolicitous consideration oil the part of their fellow citizens. They areorganized in various associations, of which the chief and mostrepresentative is the American Legion. Through its officers the Legion willpresent to the Congress numerous suggestions for legislation. They coversuch a wide variety of subjects that it is impossible to discuss themwithin the scope of this message. With many of the proposals I join inhearty approval and commend them all to the sympathetic investigation andconsideration of the Congress.FOREIGN RELATIONSAt no period in the past 12 years have our foreign relations been in such asatisfactory condition as they are at the present time. Our actions in therecent months have greatly strengthened the American policy of permanentpeace with independence. The attitude which our Government took andmaintained toward an adjustment of European reparations, by pointing outthat it wits not a political but a business problem, has demonstrated itswisdom by its actual results. We desire to see Europe restored that it mayresume its productivity in the increase of industry and its support in theadvance of civilization. We look with great gratification at the hopefulprospect of recuperation in Europe through the Dawes plan. Such assistanceas can be given through the action of the public authorities and of ourprivate citizens, through friendly counsel and cooperation, and througheconomic and financial support, not for any warlike effort but forreproductive enterprise, not to provide means for unsound governmentfinancing but to establish sound business administration should beunhesitatingly provided.Ultimately nations, like individuals, can not depend upon each other butmust depend upon themselves. Each one must work out its own salvation. Wehave every desire to help. But with all our resources we are powerless tosave unless our efforts meet with a constructive response. The situation inour own country and all over the world is one Chat can be improved only bybard work and self denial. It is necessary to reduce expenditures, increasesavings and liquidate debts. It is in this direction that there lies thegreatest hope of domestic tranquility and international peace. Our owncountry ought to finish the leading example in this effort. Our pastadherence to this policy, our constant refusal to maintain a militaryestablishment that could be thought to menace the security of others, ourhonorable dealings with other nations whether great or small, has left usin the almost constant enjoyment of peace.It is not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of thiscountry for the promotion of peace. It is the leading principle of all ourforeign relations. We have on every occasion tried to cooperate to this endin all ways that were consistent with our proper independence and ourtraditional policies. It will be my constant effort to maintain theseprinciples, and to reinforce them by all appropriate agreements andtreaties. While we desire always to cooperate and to help, we are equallydetermined to be independent and free. Right and truth and justice andhumanitarian efforts will have the moral support of this country all overthe world. But we do not wish to become involved in the politicalcontroversies of others. Nor is the country disposed to become a member ofthe League of Nations or to assume the obligations imposed by itscovenant.INTERNATIONAL COURTAmerica has been one of the foremost nations in advocating tribunals forthe settlement of international disputes of a justiciable character. Ourrepresentatives took a leading in those conferences which resulted in theestablishment of e ague Tribunal, and later in providing for a PermanentCourt of International Justice. I believe it would be for the advantage ofthis country and helpful to the stability of other nations for us to adhereto the protocol establishing, that court upon the conditions stated in therecommendation which is now before the Senate, and further that our countryshall not be bound by advisory opinions which may be, rendered by the courtupon questions which we have not voluntarily submitted for its judgment.This court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before whichwe could go voluntarily, but to which we could not be summoned, for adetermination of justiciable questions when they fail to be resolved bydiplomatic negotiations.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCEMany times I have expressed my desire to see the work of the WashingtonConference on Limitation of Armaments appropriately supplemented by furtheragreements for a further reduction M for the purpose of diminishing themenace and waste of the competition in preparing instruments ofinternational war. It has been and is my expectation that we mighthopefully approach other great powers for further conference on thissubject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as theestablished and settled policy of Europe has created a favorableopportunity. But on account of proposals which have already been made byother governments for a European conference, it will be necessary to waitto see what the outcome of their actions may be. I should not wish topropose or have representatives attend a conference which would contemplatecommitments opposed to the freedom of action we desire to maintainunimpaired with respect to our purely domestic policies.INTERNATIONAL LAWOur country should also support efforts which are being made toward thecodification of international law. We can look more hopefully, in the firstinstance, for research and studies that are likely to be productive ofresults, to a cooperation among representatives of the bar and members ofinternational law institutes and societies, than to a conference of thosewho are technically representative of their respective governments,although, when projects have been developed, they must go to thegovernments for their approval. These expert professional studies are goingon in certain quarters and should have our constant encouragement andapproval.OUTLAW OF WARMuch interest has of late been manifested in this country in the discussionof various proposals to outlaw aggressive war. I look with great sympathyupon the examination of this subject. It is in harmony with the traditionalpolicy of our country, which is against aggressive war and for themaintenance of permanent and honorable peace. While, as I have said, wemust safeguard our liberty to deal according to our own judgment with ourdomestic policies, we can not fail to view with sympathetic interest allprogress to this desired end or carefully to study the measures that may beproposed to attain it.LATIN AMERICAWhile we are desirous of promoting peace in every quarter of the globe, wehave a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere. It is our constantdesire that all causes of dispute in this area may be tranquilly andsatisfactorily adjusted. Along with our desire for peace is the earnesthope for the increased prosperity of our sister republics of Latin America,and our constant purpose to promote cooperation with them which may bemutually beneficial and always inspired by the most cordial friendships.FOREIGN DEBTSAbout $12,000,000,000 is due to our Government from abroad, mostly fromEuropean Governments. Great Britain, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania and Polandhave negotiated settlements amounting close to $5,000,000,000. Thisrepresents the funding of over 42 per cent of the debt since the creationof the special Foreign Debt Commission. As the life of this commission isabout to expire, its term should be extended. I am opposed to thecancellation of these debts and believe it for the best welfare of theworld that they should be liquidated and paid as fast as possible. I do notfavor oppressive measures, but unless money that is borrowed is repaidcredit can not be secured in time of necessity, and there exists besides amoral obligation which our country can not ignore and no other country canevade. Terms and conditions may have to conform to differences in thefinancial abilities of the countries concerned, but the principle that eachcountry should meet its obligation admits of no differences and is ofuniversal application.It is axiomatic that our country can not stand still. It would seem to beperfectly plain from recent events that it is determined to go forward. Butit wants no pretenses, it wants no vagaries. It is determined to advance inan orderly, sound and common sense way. It does not propose to abandon thetheory of the Declaration that the people have inalienable rights which nomajority and no power of government can destroy. It does not propose toabandon the practice of the Constitution that provides for the protectionof these rights. It believes that within these limitations, which areimposed not by the fiat of man but by the law of the Creator,self government is just and wise. It is convinced that it will beimpossible for the people to provide their own government unless theycontinue to own their own property.These are the very foundations of America. On them has been erected aGovernment of freedom and equality, of justice and mercy, of education andcharity. Living under it and supporting it the people have come into greatpossessions on the material and spiritual sides of life. I want to continuein this direction. I know that the Congress shares with me that desire. Iwant our institutions to be more and more expressive of these principles. Iwant the people of all the earth to see in the American flag the symbol ofa Government which intends no oppression at home and no aggression abroad,which in the spirit of a common brotherhood provides assistance in time ofdistress.
Calvin Coolidge
Members of the Congress:In meeting the constitutional requirement of informing the Congress uponthe state of the Union, it is exceedingly gratifying to report that thegeneral condition is one of progress and prosperity. Here and there arecomparatively small and apparently temporary difficulties needingadjustment and improved administrative methods, such as are always to beexpected, but in the fundamentals of government and business the resultsdemonstrate that we are going in the right direction. The country does notappear to require radical departures from the policies already adopted somuch as it needs a further extension of these policies and the improvementof details. The age of perfection is still in the somewhat distant future,but it is more in danger of being retarded by mistaken Government activitythan it is from lack of legislation. We are by far the most likely toaccomplish permanent good if we proceed with moderation.In our country the people are sovereign and independent, and must acceptthe resulting responsibilities. It is their duty to support themselves andsupport the Government. That is the business of the Nation, whatever thecharity of the Nation may require. The functions which the Congress are todischarge are not those of local government but of National Government. Thegreatest solicitude should be exercised to prevent any encroachment uponthe rights of the States or their various political subdivisions. Localself government is one of our most precious possessions. It is the greatestcontributing factor to the stability strength liberty, and progress of theNation. It ought not to be in ringed by assault or undermined by purchase.It ought not to abdicate its power through weakness or resign its authoritythrough favor. It does not at all follow that because abuses exist it isthe concern of the Federal Government to attempt the r reform.Society is in much more danger from encumbering the National Governmentbeyond its wisdom to comprehend, or its ability to administer, than fromleaving the local communities to bear their own burdens and remedy theirown evils. Our local habit and custom is so strong, our variety of race andcreed is so great the Federal authority is so tenuous, that the area withinwhich it can function successfully is very limited. The wiser policy is toleave the localities, so far as we can, possessed of their own sources ofrevenue and charged with their own obligations.GOVERNMENT ECONOMYIt is a fundamental principle of our country that the people are sovereign.While they recognize the undeniable authority of the state, they haveestablished as its instrument a Government of limited powers. They holdinviolate in their own hands the jurisdiction over their own freedom andthe ownership of their own property. Neither of these can be impairedexcept by due process of law. The wealth of our country is not publicwealth, but private wealth. It does not belong to the Government, itbelongs to the people. The Government has no justification in takingprivate Property except for a public purpose. It is always necessary tokeep these principles in mind in the laying of taxes and in the making ofappropriations. No right exists to levy on a dollar, or to order theexpenditure of a dollar, of the money of the people, except for a necessarypublic purpose duly authorized by the Constitution. The power over thepurse is the power over liberty.That is the legal limitation within which the Congress can act, How itwill, proceed within this limitation is always a question of policy. Whenthe country is prosperous and free from debt, when the rate of taxation islow, opportunity exists for assuming new burdens and undertaking newenterprises. Such a condition now prevails only to a limited extent. Allproposals for assuming new obligations ought to be postponed, unless theyare reproductive capital investments or are such as are absolutelynecessary at this time. We still have an enormous debt of over$20,000,000,000, on which the interest and sinking fund requirements are$1,320,000,000. Our appropriations for the Pension Office and the Veterans\'Bureau are $600,000,000. The War and Navy Departments call for$642,000,000. Other requirements, exclusive of the Post Office which isvirtually self sustaining, brought the appropriations for the current yearup to almost $3,100,060,000. This shows an expenditure of close to $30 forevery inhabitant of our country. For the average family of five it means atax, directly or indirectly paid, of about $150 for national purposesalone. The local tax adds much more. These enormous expenditures ought notto be increased, but through every possible effort they ought to bereduced.Only one of these great items can be ultimately extinguished. That is theitem of our war debt. Already this has been reduced to about$6,000,000,000, which means an annual saving in interest of close to$250,000,000. The present interest charge is about $820,000,000 yearly. Itwould seem to be obvious that the sooner this debt can be retired the morethe taxpayers will save in interest and the easier it will be to securefunds with which to prosecute needed running expenses, constructions, andimprovements. This item of $820,000,000 for interest is a heavy charge onall the people of the country, and it seems to me that we might wellconsider whether it is not greatly worth while to dispense with it as earlyas possible by retiring the principal debt which it is required to serve.It has always been our policy to retire our debts. That of theRevolutionary War period, notwithstanding the additions made in 1812, waspaid by 1835. and the Civil War debt within 23 years. Of the amount alreadypaid, over $1,000,000,000 is a reduction in cash balances. That source isexhausted. Over one and two thirds billions of dollars was derived fromexcess receipts. Tax reduction eliminates that. The sale of surplus warmaterials has been another element of our income. That is practicallyfinished. With these eliminated, the reduction of the debt has been onlyabout $500,000,000 each year, not an excessive sum on so large a debt.Proposals have been made to extend the payment over a period of 62 years.If $1,000,000,000 is paid at the end of 20 years, the cost to the taxpayersis the principal and, if the interest is 4% per cent, a total of$1,850,000,000. If the same sum is paid at the end of 62 years, the cost is$3,635,000,000, or almost double. Here is another consideration: Comparedwith its purchasing power in 1913, the dollar we borrowed represented but52 cents. As the value of our dollar increases, due to the falling pricesof commodities, the burden of our debt increases. It has now risen to 631/2cents. The taxpayer will be required to produce nearly twice the amount ofcommodities to pay his debt if the dollar returns to the 1913 value. Themore we pay while prices are high, the easier it will be.Deflation of government after a war period is slower than deflation ofbusiness, where curtailment is either prompt and effective or disasterfollows. There is room for further economy in the cost of the FederalGovernment, but a co n of current expenditures with pre war expenditures isnot able to the efficiency with which Government business is now beingdone. The expenditures of 19161 the last pre war year, were $742,000,000,and in 1925 over $3,500,000,000, or nearly five times as great. If wesubtract expenditures for debt retirements and interest, veterans\' relief,increase of pensions, and other special outlays, consisting of refunds,trust investments, and like charges, we find that the general expendituresof the Government in 1925 were slightly more than twice as large as in1916.As prices in 1925 were approximately 40 per cent higher than in 1916, thecost of the same Government must also have increased. But the Government isnot the same. It is more expensive to collect the much greater revenuenecessary and to administer our great debt. We have given enlarged andimproved services to agriculture and commerce. Above all, America has grownin population and wealth. Government expenditures must always share inthis growth. Taking into account the factors I have mentioned, I believethat present Federal expenses are not far out of line with pre warexpenses. We have nearly accomplished the deflation.This does not mean that further economies will not come. As we reduce ourdebt our interest charges decline. There are many details yet to correct.The real improvement, however, must come not from additional curtailment ofexpenses, but by a more intelligent, more ordered spending. Our economymust be constructive. While we should avoid as far as possible increases inpermanent current expenditures, oftentimes a capital outlay like internalimprovements will result in actual constructive saving. That is economy inits best sense. It is an avoidance of waste that there may be the means foran outlay to day which will bring larger returns to morrow. We shouldconstantly engage in scientific studies of our future requirements andadopt an orderly program for their service. Economy is the method by whichwe prepare to day to afford the improvements of to morrow.A mere policy of economy without any instrumentalities for putting it intooperation would be very ineffective. The Congress has wisely set up theBureau of the Budget to investigate and inform the President whatrecommendations he ought to make for current appropriations. This gives acentralized authority where a general and comprehensive understanding canbe reached of the sources of income and the most equitable distribution ofexpenditures. How well it has worked is indicated by the fact that thedepartmental estimates for 1922, before the budget law, were $4,068,000,000while the Budget estimates for 1927 are $3,156,000,000. This latter figureshows the reductions in departmental estimates for the coming year madepossible by the operation of the Budget system that the Congress hasprovided.But it is evidently not enough to have care in making appropriationswithout any restraint upon expenditure. The Congress has provided thatcheck by establishing the office of Comptroller General.The purpose of maintaining the Budget Director and the Comptroller Generalis to secure economy and efficiency in Government expenditure. No bettermethod has been devised for the accomplishment of that end. These officescan not be administered in all the various details without making someerrors both of fact and of judgment. But the important considerationremains that these are the instrumentalities of the Congress and that noother plan has ever been adopted which was so successful in promotingeconomy and efficiency. The Congress has absolute authority over theappropriations and is free to exercise its judgment, as the evidence maywarrant, in increasing or decreasing budget recommendations. But it oughtto resist every effort to weaken or break down this most beneficial systemof supervising appropriations and expenditures. Without it all the claim ofeconomy would be a mere pretense.TAXATIONThe purpose of reducing expenditures is to secure a reduction in taxes.That purpose is about to be realized. With commendable promptness the Waysand Means Committee of the House has undertaken in advance of the meetingof the Congress to frame a revenue act. As the bill has proceeded throughthe committee it has taken on a nonpartisan character, and both Republicansand Democrats have joined in a measure which embodies many sound principlesof tax reform. The bill will correct substantially the economic defectsinjected into the revenue act of 1924, as well as many which have remainedas war time legacies. In its present form it should provide sufficientrevenue for the Government.The excessive surtaxes have been reduced, estate tax rates are restored tomore reasonable figures, with every prospect of withdrawing from the fieldwhen the States have had the opportunity to correct the abuses in their owninheritance tax laws, the gift tax and publicity section are to be repealedmany miscellaneous taxes are lowered or abandoned, and the Board of TaxAppeals and the administrative features of the law are improved andstrengthened. I approve of the bill in principle. In so far as income taxexemptions are concerned, it seems, to me the committee has gone as far asit is Safe to go and somewhat further than I should have gone. Any furtherextension along these lines would, in my opinion, impair the integrity ofour income tax system.I am advised that the bill will be through the House by Christmas. Forthis prompt action the country call thank the good sense of the Ways andMeans Committee in framing an economic measure upon economicconsiderations. If this attitude continues to be reflected through theCongress, the taxpayer will have his relief by the time his March 15thinstallment of income taxes is due. Nonpartisan effort means certain, quickaction. Determination of a revenue law definitely, promptly and solely as arevenue law, is one of the greatest gifts a legislature can bestow upon itsconstituents. I commend the example of file Ways and Means Committee. Iffollowed, it will place sound legislation upon the books in time to givethe taxpayers the full benefit of tax reduction next year. This means thatthe bill should reach me prior to March 15.All these economic results are being sought not to benefit the rich, but tobenefit the people. They are for the purpose of encouraging industry inorder that employment may be plentiful. They seek to make business good inorder that wages may be good. They encourage prosperity in order thatpoverty may be banished from the home. They, seek to lay the foundationwhich, through increased production, may, give the people a more bountifulsupply of the necessaries of life, afford more leisure for the improvementof the mind, the appreciation of the arts of music and literature,sculpture and painting, and the beneficial enjoyment of outdoor sports andrecreation, enlarge the resources which minister to charity and by allthese means attempting to strengthen the spiritual life of the Nation.FOREIGN RELATIONSThe policy of our foreign relations, casting aside any suggestion of force,rests solely on the foundation of peace, good will, and good works. We havesought, in our intercourse with other nations, better understandingsthrough conference and exchange of views its befits beings endowed withreason. The results have been the gradual elimination of disputes, thesettlement of controversies, and the establishment of a firmer friendshipbetween America and the rest of the world that has ever existed tit anyprevious time.The example of this attitude has not been without its influence upon othercountries. Acting upon it, an adjustment was made of the difficult problemof reparations. This was the second step toward peace in Europe. It pavedthe way for the agreements which were drawn up at the Locarno Conference.When ratified, these will represent the third step toward peace. While theydo not of themselves provide an economic rehabilitation, which is necessaryfor the progress of Europe, by strengthening the guarantees of peace theydiminish the need for great armaments. If the energy which now goes intomilitary effort is transferred to productive endeavor it will greatlyassist economic progress.The Locarno agreements were made by the, European countries directlyinterested without any formal intervention of America, although on July 3I publicly advocated such agreements in an address made in Massachusetts.We have consistently refrained from intervening except when our help hasbeen sought and we have felt it could be effectively given, as in thesettlement of reparations and the London Conference. These recent Locarnoagreements represent the success of this policy which we have beeninsisting ought to be adopted, of having European countries settle theirown political problems without involving this country. This beginning seemsto demonstrate that this policy is sound. It is exceedingly gratifying toobserve this progress, both in its method and in its result promises somuch that is beneficial to the world.When these agreements are finally adopted, they will provide guarantees ofpeace that make the present prime reliance upon force in some parts ofEurope very much less necessary. The natural corollary to these treatiesshould be further international contracts for the limitation of armaments.This work was successfully begun at the Washington Conference. Nothing wasdone at that time concerning land forces because of European objection. Ourstanding army has been reduced to around 118,000, about the necessarypolice force for 115,000,000 people. We are not proposing to increase it,nor is it supposable that any foreign country looks with the slightestmisapprehension upon our land forces. They do not menace anybody. They arerather a protection to everybody.The question of disarming upon land is so peculiarly European in itspractical aspects that our country would look with particular gratitudeupon any action which those countries might take to reduce their ownmilitary forces. This is in accordance with our policy of not interveningunless the European powers are unable to agree and make request for ourassistance. Whenever they are able to agree of their own accord it isespecially gratifying to its, and such agreements may be sure of oursympathetic support.It seems clear that it is the reduction of armies rather than of naviesthat is of the first importance to the world at the present time. We shalllook with great satisfaction upon that effort and give it our approbationand encouragement. If that can be settled, we may more easily considerfurther reduction and limitation of naval armaments. For that purpose ourcountry has constantly through its Executive, and through repeated acts ofCongress, indicated its willingness to call such a conference. Undercongressional sanction it would seem to be wise to participate in anyconference of the great powers for naval limitation of armament proposedupon such conditions that it would hold a fair promise of being effective.The general policy of our country is for disarmament, and it ought not tohesitate to adopt any practical plan that might reasonably be expected tosucceed. But it would not care to attend a conference which from itslocation or constituency would in all probability prove futile.In the further pursuit, of strengthening the bonds of peace and good willwe have joined with other nations in an international conference held atGeneva and signed an agreement which will be laid before the Senate forratification providing suitable measures for control and for publicity ininternational trade in arms, ammunition, and implements of war, and alsoexecuted a protocol providing for a prohibition of the use of poison gas inwar, in accordance with the principles of Article 5 of the treaty relatingthereto signed at the Washington Conference. We are supporting the PanAmerican efforts that are being made toward the codification ofinternational law, and looking with sympathy oil the investigationsconducted under philanthropic auspices of the proposal to agreementsoutlawing war. In accordance with promises made at the WashingtonConference, we have urged the calling of and are now represented at theChinese Customs Conference and on the Commission on Extraterritoriality,where it will be our policy so far as possible to meet the, aspirations ofChina in all ways consistent with the interests of the countries involved.COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICEPending before the Senate for nearly three years is the proposal to adhereto the protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice.A well established line of precedents mark America\'s effort to effect theestablishment of it court of this nature.. We took a leading part in layingthe foundation on which it rests in the establishment of The Hague Court ofArbitration. It is that tribunal which nominates the judges who are electedby the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations.The proposal submitted to the Senate was made dependent upon fourconditions, the first of which is that by supporting the court we do notassume any obligations under the league; second, that we may participateupon an equality with other States in the election of judges; third, thatthe Congress shall determine what part of the expenses we shall bear;fourth, that the statute creating the court shall not be amended withoutout consent; and to these I have proposed an additional condition to theeffect that we are not to be bound by advisory opinions rendered withoutour consent.The court appears to be independent of the league. It is true the judgesare elected by the Assembly and Council, but they are nominated by theCourt of Arbitration, which we assisted to create and of which we are apart. The court was created by it statute, so called, which is really atreaty made among some forty eight different countries, that might properlybe called a constitution of the court. This statute provides a method bywhich the judges are chosen so that when the Court of Arbitrationnominates them and the Assembly and Council of the League elect them, theyare not acting as instruments of the Court of Arbitration or instruments ofthe league, but as instruments of the statute.This will be even more apparent if our representatives sit with the membersof the council and assembly in electing the judges. It is true they arepaid through the league though not by the league, but by the countrieswhich are members of the league and by our country if we accept theprotocol. The judges are paid by the league only in the same sense that itcould be said United States judges are paid by the Congress. The courtderives all its authority from the statute and is so completely independentof the league that it could go on functioning if the league were disbanded,at least until the terms of the judges expired.The most careful provisions are made in the statute as to thequalifications of judges. Those who make the nominations are recommended toconsult with their highest court of justice, their law schools andacademies. The judges must be persons of high moral character, qualified tohold the highest judicial offices in that country, or be jurisconsults ofrecognized competence in international law. It must be assumed that theserequirements will continue to be carefully met, and with America joiningthe countries already concerned it is difficult to comprehend how humaningenuity could better provide for the establishment of a court which wouldmaintain its independence. It has to be recognized that independence is toa considerable extent a matter of ability, character, and personality. Someeffort was made in the early beginnings to interfere with the independenceof our Supreme Court. It did not succeed because of the quality of the menwho made up that tribunal.It does not seem that the authority to give advisory opinions interfereswith the independence of the court. Advisory opinions in and of themselvesare not harmful, but may be used in such a way as to be very beneficialbecause they undertake to prevent injury rather than merely afford a remedyafter the injury has been done. As a principle that only implies that thecourt shall function when proper application is made to it. Deciding thequestion involved upon issues submitted for an advisory opinion does notdiffer materially from deciding the question involved upon issues submittedby contending parties. Up to the present time the court has given anadvisory opinion when it judged it had jurisdiction, and refused to giveone when it judged it did not have jurisdiction. Nothing in the work of thecourt has yet been an indication that this is an impairment of itsindependence or that its practice differs materially from the giving oflike opinions under the authority of the constitutions of several of ourStates.No provision of the statute seems to me to give this court any authority tobe a political rather than a judicial court. We have brought cases in thiscountry before our courts which, when they have been adjudged to bepolitical, have been thereby dismissed. It is not improbable that politicalquestions will be submitted to this court, but again up to the present timethe court has refused to pass on political questions and our support wouldundoubtedly have a tendency to strengthen it in that refusal.We are not proposing to subject ourselves to any compulsory jurisdiction.If we support the court, we can never be obliged to submit any case whichinvolves our interests for its decision. Our appearance before it wouldalways be voluntary, for the purpose of presenting a case which we hadagreed might be presented. There is no more danger that others might bringcases before the court involving our interests which we did not wish tohave brought, after we have adhered, and probably not so much, than therewould be of bringing such cases if we do not adhere. I think that we wouldhave the same legal or moral right to disregard such a finding in the onecase that we would in the other.If we are going to support any court, it will not be one that we have setup alone or which reflects only our ideals. Other nations have theircustoms and their institutions, their thoughts and their methods of life.If a court is going to be international, its composition will have to yieldto what is good in all these various elements. Neither will it be possibleto support a court which is exactly perfect, or under which we assumeabsolutely no obligations. If we are seeking that opportunity, we might aswell declare that we are opposed to supporting any court. If any agreementis made, it will be because it undertakes to set up a tribunal which can dosome of the things that other nations wish to have done. We shall not findourselves bearing a disproportionate share of the world\'s burdens by ouradherence, and we may as well remember that there is absolutely no escapefor our country from bearing its share of the world\'s burdens in any case.We shall do far better service to ourselves and to others if we admit thisand discharge our duties voluntarily, than if we deny it and are forced tomeet the same obligations unwillingly.It is difficult to imagine anything that would be more helpful to the worldthan stability, tranquility and international justice. We may say that weare contributing to these factors independently, but others lessfortunately located do not and can not make a like contribution exceptthrough mutual cooperation. The old balance of power, mutual alliances, andgreat military forces were not brought bout by any mutual dislike forindependence, but resulted from the domination of circumstances. Ultimatelythey were forced on us. Like all others engaged in the war whatever we saidas a matter of fact we joined an alliance, we became a military power, weimpaired our independence. We have more at stake than any one else inavoiding a repetition of that calamity. Wars do not, spring into existence.They arise from small incidents and trifling irritations which can beadjusted by an international court. We can contribute greatly to theadvancement of our ideals by joining with other nations in maintaining sucha tribunal.FOREIGN DEBTSGradually, settlements have been made which provide for the liquidation ofdebts due to our Government from foreign governments. Those made with GreatBritain, Finland, Hungary Lithuania, and Poland have already been approvedby the Congress. Since the adjournment, further agreements have beenentered into with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Italy, andRumania. These 11 nations, which have already made settlements, represent$6,419,528,641 of the original principal of the loans. The principal sumswithout interest, still pending, are the debt of France, of $3,340,000,000;Greece, $15,000,000; Yugoslavia, $.51,000,000; Liberia, $26,000; Russia,$192,000,000, which those at present in control have undertaken, openly torepudiate; Nicaragua, $84,000, which is being paid currently; and Austria,$24,000,000, on which by act of Congress a moratorium of 20 years has beengranted. The only remaining sum is $12,000,000, due from Armenia, which hasnow ceased to exist as an independent nation.In accordance with the settlements made, the amount of principal andinterest which is to be paid to the United States under these agreementsaggregate $15,200,688,253.93. It is obvious that the remaining settlements,which will undoubtedly be made, will bring this sum up to an amount whichwill more than equal the principal due on our present national debt. Whilethese settlements are very large in the aggregate, it has been felt thatthe terms granted were in all cases very generous. They impose no undueburden and are mutually beneficial in the observance of international faithand the improvement of international credit.Every reasonable effort will be made to secure agreements for liquidationwith the remaining countries, whenever they are in such condition that theycan be made. Those which have already been negotiated under the bipartisancommission established by the Congress have been made only after the mostthoroughgoing and painstaking investigation, continued for a long timebefore meeting with the representatives of the countries concerned. It isbelieved that they represent in each instance the best that can be done andthe wisest settlement that can be secured. One very important result is thestabilization of foreign currency, making exchange assist rather thanembarrass our trade. Wherever sacrifices have been made of money, it willbe more than amply returned in better understanding and friendship, whilein so far as these adjustments will contribute to the financial stabilityof the debtor countries, to their good order, prosperity, and progress,they represent hope of improved trade relations and mutual contributions tothe civilization of the world.ALIEN PROBLEMNegotiations are progressing among the interested parties in relation tothe final distribution of the assets in the hands of the Alien PropertyCustodian. Our Government and people are interested as creditors; theGerman Government and people are interested as debtors and owners of theseized property. Pending the outcome of these negotiations, I do notrecommend any affirmative legislation. For the present we should continuein possession of this property which we hold as security for the settlementof claims due to our people and our Government.IMMIGRATIONWhile not enough time has elapsed to afford a conclusive demonstration,such results as have been secured indicate that our immigration law is onthe whole beneficial. It is undoubtedly a protection to the wage earners ofthis country. The situation should however, be carefully surveyed, in orderto ascertain whether it is working a needless hardship upon our owninhabitants. If it deprives them of the comfort and society of those boundto them by close family ties, such modifications should be adopted as willafford relief, always in accordance with the principle that our Governmentowes its first duty to our own people and that no alien, inhabitant ofanother country, has any legal rights whatever under our Constitution andlaws. It is only through treaty, or through residence here that such rightsaccrue. But we should not, however, be forgetful of the obligations of acommon humanity.While our country numbers among its best citizens many of those of foreignbirth, yet those who now enter in violation of our laws by that very actthereby place themselves in a class of undesirables. Investigationreveals that any considerable number are coming here in defiance of ourimmigration restrictions, it will undoubtedly create the necessity for theregistration of all aliens. We ought to have no prejudice against an alienbecause he is an alien. The standard which we apply to our inhabitants isthat of manhood, not place of birth. Restrictive immigration is to a largedegree for economic purposes. It is applied in order that we may not have alarger annual increment of good people within our borders than we can weaveinto our economic fabric in such a way as to supply their needs withoutundue injury to ourselves.NATIONAL DEFENSENever before in time of peace has our country maintained so large andeffective a military force as it now has. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps,National Guard, and Organized Reserves represent a strength of about558,400 men. These forces are well trained, well equipped, and high inmorale.A sound selective service act giving broad authority for the mobilizationin time of peril of all the resources of the country, both persons andmaterials, is needed to perfect our defense policy in accordance with ourideals of equality. The provision for more suitable housing to be paid forout of funds derived from the sale of excess lands, pending before the lastCongress, ought to be brought forward and passed. Reasonable replacementsought to be made to maintain a sufficient ammunition reserve.The Navy has the full treaty tonnage of capital ships. Work is goingforward in modernizing the older ones, building aircraft carriers,additional fleet submarines, and fast scout cruisers, but we are carefullyavoiding anything that might be construed as a competition in armamentswith other nations. The joint Army and Navy maneuvers at Hawaii, followedby the cruise of a full Battle Fleet to Australia and New Zealand, weresuccessfully carried out. These demonstrations revealed a most satisfactorycondition of the ships and the men engaged.Last year at my suggestion the General Board of the Navy made aninvestigation and report on the relation of aircraft to warships. As aresult authorizations and appropriations were made for more scout cruisersand fleet submarines and for completing aircraft carriers and equippingthem with necessary planes. Additional training in aviation was begun atthe Military and Naval Academies. A method of coordination and cooperationof the Army and Navy and the principal aircraft builders is beingperfected. At the suggestion of the Secretaries of War and Navy I appointeda special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft.The report of the Air Board ought to be reassuring to the country,gratifying to the service and satisfactory to the Congress. It isthoroughly complete and represents the mature thought of the best talent inthe country. No radical change in organization of the service seemsnecessary. The Departments of War, Navy, and Commerce should each beprovided with an additional assistant secretary, not necessarily withstatutory duties but who would be available under the direction of theSecretary to give especial attention to air navigation. We must have an airstrength worthy of America. Provision should be made for two additionalbrigadier generals for the Army Air Service. Temporary rank correspondingto their duties should be awarded to active flying officers in both Armyand Navy.Aviation is of great importance both for national defense and commercialdevelopment. We ought to proceed in its improvement by the necessaryexperiment and investigation. Our country is not behind in this art. It hasmade records for speed and for the excellence of its planes. It ought to goon maintaining its manufacturing plants capable of rapid production, givingnational assistance to the la in out of airways, equipping itself with amoderate number of planes and keeping an air force trained to the highestefficiency.While I am a thorough believer in national defense and entirely committedto the policy of adequate preparation, I am just as thoroughly opposed toinstigating or participating in a policy of competitive armaments. Nor doespreparation mean a policy of militarizing. Our people and industries aresolicitous for the cause of 0111, country, and have great respect for theArmy and Navy and foil the uniform worn by the men who stand ready at alltimes for our protection to encounter the dangers and perils necessary tomilitary service, but all of these activities are to be taken not in behalfof aggression but in behalf of peace. They are the instruments by which weundertake to do our part to promote good will and support stability amongall peoples.VETERANSIf any one desires to estimate the esteem in which the veterans of Americaare held by their fellow citizens, it is but necessary to remember that thecurrent budget calls for an expenditure of about $650,000.000 in theirbehalf. This is nearly the amount of the total cost of the NationalGovernment, exclusive of the post office, before we entered the last war.At the two previous sessions of Congress legislation affecting veterans\'relief was enacted and the law liberalized. This legislation brought intobeing a number of new provisions tending more nearly to meet the needs ofour veterans, as well as afford the necessary authority to perfect theadministration of these laws.Experience with the new legislation so far has clearly demonstrated itsconstructive nature. It has increased the benefits received by many and hasmade eligible for benefits many others. Direct disbursements to the veteranor his dependents exceeding $21,000,000 have resulted, which otherwisewould not have been made. The degree of utilization of our hospitals hasincreased through making facilities available to the incapacitated veteranregardless of service origin of the disability. This new legislation alsohas brought about a marked improvement of service to the veteran.The organizations of ex service men have proposed additional legislativechanges which you will consider, but until the new law and themodifications made at the last session of Congress are given a morethorough test further changes in the basic law should be few and made onlyafter careful though sympathetic consideration.The principal work now before the Veterans\' Bureau is the perfection of itsorganization and further improvements in service. Some minor legislativechanges are deemed necessary to enable the bureau to retain that high gradeof professional talent essential in handling the problems of the bureau.Such changes as tend toward the improvement of service and the carryingforward to completion of the hospital construction program are recommendedfor the consideration of the proper committees of Congress.With the enormous outlay that is now being made in behalf of the veteransand their dependents, with a tremendous war debt still requiring greatannual expenditure, with the still high rate of taxation, while everyprovision should be made for the relief of the disabled and the necessarycare of dependents, the Congress may well consider whether the financialcondition of the Government is not such that further bounty through theenlargement of general pensions and other emoluments ought not to bepostponed.AGRICULTURENo doubt the position of agriculture as a whole has very much improvedsince the depression of three and four years ago. But there are manylocalities and many groups of individuals, apparently through no fault oftheir own, sometimes due to climatic conditions and sometimes to theprevailing price of a certain crop, still in a distressing condition. Thisis probably temporary, but it is none the less acute. National Governmentagencies, the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, the Farm Loan Board,the intermediate credit banks, and the Federal Reserve Board are allcooperating to be of assistance and relief. On the other hand, there arelocalities and individuals who have had one of their most prosperous years.The general price level is fair, but here again there are exceptions bothways, some items being poor while others are excellent. In spite of alessened production the farm income for this year will be about the same aslast year and much above the three preceding years.Agriculture is a very complex industry. It does not consist of one problem,but of several. They can not be solved at one stroke. They have to be metin different ways, and small gains are not to be despised.It has appeared from all the investigations that I have been able to makethat the farmers as a whole are determined to maintain the independence oftheir business. They do not wish to have meddling on the part of theGovernment or to be placed under the inevitable restrictions involved inany system of direct or indirect price fixing, which would result frompermitting the Government to operate in the agricultural markets. They areshowing a very commendable skill in organizing themselves to transact theirown business through cooperative marketing, which will this year turn overabout $2,500,000,000, or nearly one fifth of the total agriculturalbusiness. In this they are receiving help from the Government. TheDepartment of Agriculture should be strengthened in this facility, in orderto be able to respond when these marketing associations want help. Whileit ought not to undertake undue regulation, it should be equipped to giveprompt information on crop prospects, supply, demand, current receipts,imports, exports, and prices.A bill embodying these principles, which has been drafted under the adviceand with the approval of substantially all the leaders and managers in thecooperative movement, will be presented to the Congress for its enactment.Legislation should also be considered to provide for leasing theunappropriated public domain for grazing purposes and adopting a uniformpolicy relative to grazing on the public lands and in the nationalforests.A more intimate relation should be established between agriculture and theother business activities of the Nation. They are mutually dependent andcan each advance their own prosperity most by advancing the prosperity ofthe other. Meantime the Government will continue those activities whichhave resulted in an unprecedented amount of legislation and the pouring outof great sums of money during the last five years. The work for good roads,better land and water transportation, increased support for agriculturaleducation, extension of credit facilities through the Farm Loan Boards andthe intermediate credit banks, the encouragement of orderly marketing and arepression of wasteful speculation, will all be continued.Following every other depression, after a short period the price of farmproduce has taken and maintained the lead in the advance. This advance hadreached a climax before the war. Everyone will recall the discussion thatwent on for four or five years prior to 1914 concerning the high cost ofliving. This history is apparently beginning to repeat itself. Whilewholesale prices of other commodities have been declining, farm prices havebeen increasing. There is every reason to suppose that a new era inagricultural prosperity lies just before us, which will probably beunprecedented.MUSCLE SHOALSThe problem of Muscle Shoals seems to me to have assumed a place all out ofproportion with its real importance. It probably does not represent inmarket value much more than a first class battleship, yet it has beendiscussed in the Congress over a period of years and for months at a time.It ought to be developed for the production of nitrates primarily, andincidentally for power purposes. This would serve defensive, agricultural,and industrial purposes. I am in favor of disposing of this property tomeet these purposes. The findings of the special commission will betransmitted to the Congress for their information. I am convinced that thebest possible disposition can be made by direct authorization of theCongress. As a means of negotiation I recommend the immediate appointmentof a small joint special committee chosen from the appropriate generalstanding committees of the House and Senate to receive bids, which whenmade should be reported with recommendations as to acceptance, upon which alaw should be enacted, effecting a sale to the highest bidder who willagree to carry out these purposes.If anything were needed to demonstrate the almost utter incapacity of theNational Government to deal directly with an industrial and commercialproblem, it has been provided by our experience with this property. We haveexpended vast fortunes, we have taxed everybody, but we are unable tosecure results, which benefit anybody. This property ought, to betransferred to private management under conditions which will dedicate itto the public purpose for which it was conceived.RECLAMATIONThe National Government is committed to a policy of reclamation andirrigation which it desires to establish on a sound basis and continue inthe interest of the localities concerned. Exhaustive studies have recentlybeen made of Federal reclamation, which have resulted in improving theprojects and adjusting many difficulties. About one third of the projectsis in good financial condition, another third can probably be madeprofitable, while the other third is under unfavorable conditions. TheCongress has already provided for a survey which will soon be embodied in areport. That ought to suggest a method of relief which will makeunnecessary further appeals to the Congress. Unless this can be done,Federal reclamation will be considerably retarded. With the greatlyincreased cost of construction and operation, it has become necessary toplan in advance, by community organization and selective agriculture,methods sufficient to repay these increasing outlays.The human and economic interests of the farmer citizens suggest that theStates should be required to exert some effort and assume someresponsibility, especially in the intimate, detailed, and difficult work ofsecuring settlers and developing farms which directly profit them, but onlyindirectly and remotely can reimburse the Nation. It is believed that theFederal Government should continue to be the agency for planning andconstructing the great undertakings needed to regulate and bring into usethe rivers the West, many of which are interstate in character, but thedetailed work of creating agricultural communities and a rural civilizationon the land made ready for reclamation ought to be either transferred tothe State in its entirety or made a cooperative effort of the State andFederal Government.SHIPPINGThe maintenance of a merchant marine is of the utmost importance fornational defense and the service of our commerce. We have a large number ofships engaged in that service. We also have a surplus supply, costly tocare for, which ought to be sold. All the investigations that have beenmade under my direction, and those which have been prosecutedindependently, have reached the conclusion that the fleet should be underthe direct control of a single executive head, while the Shipping Boardshould exercise its judicial and regulatory functions in Accordance withits original conception. The report of Henry G. Dalton, a business man ofbroad experience, with a knowledge of shipping, made to me after carefulinvestigation, will be transmitted for the information of the Congress, thestudies pursued under the direction of the United States Chamber ofCommerce will also be accessible, and added to these will be the report ofthe special committee of the House.I do not advocate the elimination of regional considerations, but it hasbecome apparent that without centralized executive action the management ofthis great business, like the management of any other great business, willflounder in incapacity and languish under a division of council. A plainand unmistakable reassertion of this principle of unified control, which Ihave always been advised was the intention of the Congress to apply, isnecessary to increase the efficiency of our merchant fleet.COALThe perennial conflict in the coal industry is still going on to the greatdetriment of the wage earners, the owners, and especially to the public.With deposits of coal in this country capable of supplying its needs forhundreds of years, inability to manage and control this great resource forthe benefit of all concerned is very close to a national economic failure.It has been the subject of repeated investigation and reiteratedrecommendation. Yet the industry seems never to have accepted modernmethods of adjusting differences between employers and employees. Theindustry could serve the public much better and become subject to a muchmore effective method of control if regional consolidations and morefreedom in the formation of marketing associations, under the supervisionof the Department of Commerce, were permitted.At the present time the National Government has little or no authority todeal with this vital necessity of the life of the country. It has permitteditself to remain so powerless that its only attitude must be humblesupplication. Authority should be lodged with the President and theDepartments of Commerce and Labor, giving them power to deal with anemergency. They should be able to appoint temporary boards with authorityto call for witnesses and documents, conciliate differences, encouragearbitration, and in case of threatened scarcity exercise control overdistribution. Making the facts public under these circumstances through astatement from an authoritative source would be of great public benefit.The report of the last coal commission should be brought forward,reconsidered, and acted upon.PROHIBITIONUnder the orderly processes of our fundamental institutions theConstitution was lately amended providing for national prohibition. TheCongress passed an act for its enforcement, and similar acts have beenprovided by most of the States. It is the law of the land. It is the dutyof all who come under its, jurisdiction to observe the spirit of that law,and it is the duty of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Departmentto enforce it. Action to prevent smuggling, illegal transportation ininterstate commerce, abuse in the use of permits, and existence of sourcesof supply for illegal traffic is almost entirely imposed upon the FederalGovernment.Through treaties with foreign governments and increased activities of theCoast Guard, revenue agents, district attorneys and enforcement agentseffort is being made to prevent these violations. But the Constitution alsoputs a concurrent duty on the States. We need their active and energeticcooperation, the vigilant action of their police, and the jurisdiction oftheir courts to assist in enforcement. I request of the people observance,of the public officers continuing efforts for enforcement, and of theCongress favorable action on the budget recommendation for the prosecutionof this work.WATERWAY DEVELOPMENTFor many years our country has been employed in plans and M for thedevelopment of our intracoastal and inland waterways. This work along ourcoast is an important adjunct to our commerce. It will be carried on,together with the further opening up of our harbors, as our resourcespermit. The Government made an agreement during the war to take over theCape Cod Canal, under which the owners made valuable concessions. Thispledged faith of the Government ought to be redeemed.Two other main fields are under consideration. One is the Great Lakes andSt. Lawrence, including the Erie Canal. This includes stabilizing the lakelevel, and is both a waterway and power project. A joint commission of theUnited States and Canada is working on plans and surveys which will not becompleted until next April. No final determination can be made, apparently,except under treaty as to the participation of both countries. The other isthe Mississippi River stem. This is almost entirely devoted to navigation.Work on the Ohio River will be completed in about three years. A modernchannel connecting Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Pittsburgh shouldbe laid out and work on the tributaries prosecuted. Some work is being doneof a preparatory nature along the Missouri, and large expenditures arebeing made yearly in the lower reaches of the Mississippi and itstributaries which contribute both to flood control and navigation.Preliminary measures are being taken on the Colorado River project, whichis exceedingly important for flood control, irrigation, power development,and water supply to the area concerned. It would seem to be very doubtful,however, whether it is practical to secure affirmative action of theCongress, except under a Joint agreement of the several States.The Government has already expended large sums upon scientific research andengineering investigation in promotion of this Colorado River project. Theactual progress has been retarded for many years by differences among theseven States in the basin over their relative water rights and amongdifferent groups as to methods. In an attempt to settle the primarydifficulty of the water rights, Congress authorized the Colorado RiverCommission which agreed on November 24, 1922, upon an interstate compact tosettle these rights, subject to the ratification of the State legislaturesand Congress. All seven States except Arizona at one time ratified, theArizona Legislature making certain reservations which failed to meet theapproval of the governor. Subsequently an attempt was made to establish thecompact upon a six State basis, but in this case California imposedreservations. There appears to be no division of opinion upon the majorprinciples of the compact, but difficulty in separating contentions tomethods of development from the discussion of it. It is imperative thatflood control be undertaken for California and Arizona. preparation madefor irrigation, for power, and for domestic water.Some or all of these questions are combined in every proposed development.The Federal Government is interested in some of these phases, Stategovernments and municipalities and irrigation districts in others, andprivate corporations in still others. Because of all this difference ofview it is most desirable that Congress should consider the creation ofsome agency that will be able to determine methods of improvement solelyupon economic and engineering facts, that would be authorized to negotiateand settle, subject to the approval of Congress, the participation, rights,and obligations of each group in any particular works. Only by some suchmethod can early construction be secured.WATER POWERAlong with the development of navigation should go every possibleencouragement for the development of our water power. While steam stillplays a dominant part, this is more and more becoming an era ofelectricity. Once installed, the cost is moderate, has not tended greatlyto increase, and is entirely free from the unavoidable dirt anddisagreeable features attendant upon the burning of coal. Every facilityshould be extended for the connection of the various units into asuperpower plant, capable at all times of a current increasing uniformityover the entire system.RAILROADSThe railroads throughout the country are in a fair state of prosperity.Their service is good and their supply of cars is abundant. Their conditionwould be improved and the public better served by a system ofconsolidations. I recommend that the Congress authorize such consolidationstinder the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, with power toapprove or disapprove when proposed parts are excluded or new parts added.I am informed that the railroad managers and their employees have reached asubstantial agreement as to what legislation is necessary to regulate andimprove their relationship. Whenever they bring forward such proposals,which seem sufficient also to protect the interests of the public, theyshould be enacted into law.It is gratifying to report that both the railroad managers and railroademployees are providing boards for the mutual adjustment of differences inharmony with the principles of conference, conciliation, and arbitration.The solution of their problems ought to be an example to all otherindustries. Those who ask the protections of civilization should be readyto use the methods of civilization.A strike in modern industry has many of the aspects of war in the modernworld. It injures labor and it injures capital. If the industry involved isa basic one, it reduces the necessary economic surplus and, increasing thecost of living, it injures the economic welfare and general comfort of thewhole people. It also involves a deeper cost. It tends to embitter anddivide the community into warring classes and thus weakens the unity andpower of our national life.Labor can make no permanent gains at the cost of the general welfare. Allthe victories won by organized labor in the past generation have been wonthrough the support of public opinion. The manifest inclination of themanagers and employees of the railroads to adopt a policy of action inharmony with these principles marks a new epoch in our industrial life.OUTLYING POSSESSIONSThe time has come for careful investigation of the expenditures and successof the laws by which we have undertaken to administer our outlyingpossessions. A very large amount of money is being expended foradministration in Alaska. It appears so far out of proportion to the numberof inhabitants and the amount of production as to indicate cause forthorough investigation. Likewise consideration should be given to theexperience under the law which governs the Philippines. From such reportsas reach me there are indications that more authority should be given tothe Governor General, so that he will not be so dependent upon the locallegislative body to render effective our efforts to set an example of the,sound administration and good government, which is so necessary for thepreparation of the Philippine people for self government under ultimateindependence. If they are to be trained in these arts, it is our duty toprovide for them the best that there is.RETIREMENT OF JUDGESThe act of March 3, 1911, ought to be amended so that the term of years ofservice of judges of any court of the United States requisite forretirement with pay shall be computed to include not only continuous butaggregate service.MOTHERS\' AIDThe Government ought always to be alert on the side of the humanities. ItOught to encourage provisions for economic justice for the defenseless. Itought to extend its relief through its national and local agencies, as maybe appropriate in each case, to the suffering and the needy. It ought to becharitable.Although more than 40 of our States have enacted measures in aid ofmotherhood, the District of Columbia is still without such a law. Acarefully considered bill will be presented, which ought to have mostthoughtful consideration in order that the Congress may adopt a measurewhich will be hereafter a model for all parts of the Union.CIVIL SERVICEIn 1883 the Congress passed the civil service act, which from a modestbeginning of 14,000 employees has grown until there are now 425,000 in theclassified service. This has removed the clerical force of the Nation fromthe wasteful effects of the spoils system and made it more stable andefficient. The time has come to consider classifying all postmasters,collectors of customs, collectors of internal revenue, and prohibitionagents, by an act covering in those at present in office, except whenotherwise provided by Executive order.The necessary statistics are now being gathered to form the basis of avaluation of the civil service retirement fund based on current conditionsof the service. It is confidently expected that this valuation will becompleted in time to be made available to the Congress during the presentsession. It will afford definite knowledge of existing, and futureliabilities under the present law and determination OF liabilities underany proposed change in the present law. We should have this informationbefore creating further obligations for retirement annuities which willbecome liabilities to be met in the future from the money of the taxpayer.The classification act of 1923, with the subsequent legislative actionproviding for adjustment of the compensation of field service positions,has operated materially to improve employment conditions in the Federalservice. The administration of the act is in the hands of an impartialboard, functioning without the necessity of a direct appropriation. Itwould be inadvisable at this time to place in other hands theadministration of this act.FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONThe proper function of the Federal Trade Commission is to supervise andcorrect those practices in commerce which are detrimental to faircompetition. In this it performs a useful function and should be continuedand supported. It was designed also to be a help to honest business. In mymessage to the Sixty eighth Congress I recommended that changes in theprocedure then existing be made. Since then the commission by its ownaction has reformed its rules, giving greater speed and economy in thedisposal of its cases and full opportunity for those accused to be heard.These changes are improvements and, if necessary, provision should be madefor their permanency.REORGANIZATIONNo final action has yet been taken on the measure providing for thereorganization of the various departments. I therefore suggest that thismeasure, which will be of great benefit to the efficient and economicaladministration of the business of the Government, be brought forward andpassed.THE NEGRONearly one tenth of our population consists of the Negro race. The progresswhich they have made in all the arts of civilization in the last 60 yearsis almost beyond belief. Our country has no more loyal citizens. But theydo still need sympathy, kindness, and helpfulness. They need reassurancethat the requirements of the Government and society to deal out to themeven handed justice will be met. They should be protected from all violenceand supported in the peaceable enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.Those who do violence to them should be punished for their crimes. No othercourse of action is worthy of the American people.Our country has many elements in its population, many different modes ofthinking and living, all of which are striving in their own way to be loyalto the high ideals worthy of the crown of American citizenship. It isfundamental of our institutions that they seek to guarantee to all ourinhabitants the right to live their own lives under the protection of thepublic law. This does not include any license to injure others materially,physically, morally, to Incite revolution, or to violate the establishedcustoms which have long had the sanction of enlightened society.But it does mean the full right to liberty and equality before the lawwithout distinction of race or creed. This condition can not be granted toothers, or enjoyed by ourselves, except by the application of the principleof broadest tolerance. Bigotry is only another name for slavery. It reducesto serfdom not only those against whom it is directed, but also those whoseek to apply it. An enlarged freedom can only be secured by theapplication of the golden rule. No other utterance ever presented such apractical rule of life.CONCLUSIONIt is apparent that we are reaching into an era of great generalprosperity. It will continue only so long as we shall use it properly.After all, there is but a fixed quantity of wealth in this country at anyfixed time. The only way that we can all secure more of it is to createmore. The element of time enters into production, If the people havesufficient moderation and contentment to be willing to improve theircondition by the process of enlarging production, eliminating waste, anddistributing equitably, a prosperity almost without limit lies before its.If the people are to be dominated by selfishness, seeking immediate richesby nonproductive speculation and by wasteful quarreling over the returnsfrom industry, they will be confronted by the inevitable results ofdepression and privation. If they will continue industrious and thrifty,contented with fair wages and moderate profits, and the returns whichaccrue from the development of oar natural resources, our prosperity willextend itself indefinitely.In all your deliberations you should remember that the purpose oflegislation is to translate principles into action. It is an effort to haveour country be better by doing better. Because the thoughts and ways ofpeople are firmly fixed and not easily changed, the field within whichimmediate improvement can be secured is very narrow. Legislation canprovide opportunity. Whether it is taken advantage of or not depends uponthe people themselves. The Government of the United States has been createdby the people. It is solely responsible to them. It will be most successfulif it is conducted solely for their benefit. All its efforts would be oflittle avail unless they brought more justice, more enlightenment, morehappiness and prosperity into the home. This means an opportunity toobserve religion, secure education, and earn a living under a reign of lawand order. It is the growth and improvement of the material and spirituallife of the Nation. We shall not be able to gain these ends merely by ourown action. If they come at all, it will be because we have been willing towork in harmony with the abiding purpose of a Divine Providence.
Calvin Coolidge
Members of the Congress:In reporting to the Congress the state of the Union, I find it impossibleto characterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity. In somequarters our diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolvedproblems, but nowhere are we met with armed conflict. If some occupationsand areas are not flourishing, in none does there remain any acute chronicdepression. What the country requires is not so much new policies as asteady continuation of those which are already being crowned with suchabundant success. It can not be too often repeated that in common with allthe world we are engaged in liquidating the war.In the present short session no great amount of new legislation ispossible, but in order to comprehend what is most desirable some survey ofour general situation is necessary. A large amount of time is consumed inthe passage of appropriation bills. If each Congress in its opening sessionwould make appropriations to continue for two years, very much time wouldbe saved which could either be devoted to a consideration of the generalneeds of the country or would result in decreasing the work of legislation.ECONOMYOur present state of prosperity has been greatly promoted by threeimportant causes, one of which is economy, resulting in reduction andreform in national taxation. Another is the elimination of many kinds ofwaste. The third is a general raising of the standards of efficiency. Thiscombination has brought the perfectly astonishing result of a reduction inthe index price of commodities and an increase in the index rate of wages.We have secured a lowering of the cost to produce and a raising of theability to consume. Prosperity resulting from these causes rests on thesecurest of all foundations. It gathers strength from its own progress.In promoting this progress the chief part which the National Governmentplays lies in the field of economy. Whatever doubts may have beenentertained as to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial resultswhich would accrue from it to all the people of the Nation, its wisdom mustnow be considered thoroughly demonstrated. It may not have appeared to be anovel or perhaps brilliant conception, but it has turned out to bepreeminently sound. It has not failed to work. It has surely broughtresults. It does not have to be excused as a temporary expedient adopted asthe lesser evil to remedy some abuse, it is not a palliative seeking totreat symptoms, but a major operation for the, eradication at the source ofa large number of social diseases.Nothing is easier than the expenditure of public money. It does not appearto belong to anybody. The temptation is overwhelming to bestow it onsomebody. But the results of extravagance are ruinous. The property of thecountry, like the freedom of the country, belongs to the people of thecountry. They have not empowered their Government to take a dollar of itexcept for a necessary public purpose. But if the Constitution conferredsuch right, sound economics would forbid it. Nothing is more, destructiveof the progress of the Nation than government extravagance. It means anincrease in the burden of taxation, dissipation of the returns fromenterprise, a decrease in the real value of wages, with ultimate stagnationand decay. The whole theory of our institutions is based on the liberty andindependence of the individual. He is dependent on himself for support andtherefore entitled to the rewards of his own industry. He is not to bedeprived of what he earns that others may be benefited by what they do notearn. What he saves through his private effort is not to be wasted byGovernment extravagance.Our national activities have become so vast that it is necessary toscrutinize each item of public expenditure if we are to apply the principleof economy. At the last session we made an immediate increase in the annualbudget of more than $100,000,000 in benefits conferred on the veterans ofthree wars, public buildings, and river and harbor improvement. Manyprojects are being broached requiring further large outlays. I am convincedthat it would be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoid at thepresent session all commitments except those of the most pressing nature.From a reduction of the debt and taxes will accrue a wider benefit to allthe people of this country than from embarking on any new enterprise. Whenour war debt is decreased we shall have resources for expansion. Until thatis accomplished we should confine ourselves to expenditures of the mosturgent necessity.The Department of Commerce has performed a most important function inmaking plans and securing support of all kinds of national enterprise forthe elimination of waste. Efficiency has been greatly promoted through goodmanagement and the constantly increasing cooperation of the wage earnersthroughout the whole realm of private business. It is my opinion that thiswhole development has been predicated on the foundation of a protectivetariff.TAX REDUCTIONAs a result of economy of administration by the Executive and ofappropriation by the Congress, the end of this fiscal year will leave asurplus in the Treasury estimated at $383,000,000. Unless otherwiseordered, such surplus is used for the retirement of the war debt. A bondwhich can be retired today for 100 cents will cost the people 104 1/4cents to retire a year from now. While I favor a speedy reduction of thedebt as already required by law and in accordance with the promises made tothe holders of our Liberty bonds when they were issued, there is no reasonwhy a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be applied to areduction of taxation. It can not be repeated too often that the enormousrevenues of this Nation could not be collected without becoming a charge onall the people whether or not they directly pay taxes. Everyone who ispaying or the bare necessities of fool and shelter and clothing, withoutconsidering the better things of life, is indirectly paying a national tax.The nearly 20,000,000 owners of securities, the additional scores ofmillions of holders of insurance policies and depositors in savings banks,are all paying a national tax. Millions of individuals and corporations aremaking a direct contribution to the National Treasury which runs from 11/2to 25 per cent of their income, besides a number of special requirements,like automobile and admission taxes. Whenever the state of the Treasurywill permit, I believe in a reduction of taxation. I think the taxpayersare entitled to it. But I am not advocating tax reduction merely for thebenefit of the taxpayer; I am advocating it for the benefit of thecountry.If it appeared feasible, I should welcome permanent tax reduction at thistime. The estimated surplus, however, for June 30, 1928, is not much largerthan is required in a going business of nearly $4,000,000,000. We have hadbut a few months\' experience under the present revenue act and shall needto know what is developed by the returns of income produced under it, whichare not required t o be made until about the time this session terminates,and what the economic probabilities of the country are in the latter partof 1927, before we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent taxreduction. Moreover the present surplus results from many nonrecurrentitems. Meantime, it is possible to grant some real relief by a simplemeasure making reductions in the payments which accrue on the 15th of Marchand June, 1927. I am very strongly of the conviction that this is so much apurely business matter that it ought not to be dealt with in a partisanspirit. The Congress has already set the notable example of treating taxproblems without much reference to party, which might well be continued.What I desire to advocate most earnestly is relief for the country fromunnecessary tax burdens. We can not secure that if we stop to engage in apartisan controversy. As I do not think any change in the special taxes, ortiny permanent reduction is practical, I therefore urge both parties of theHouse Ways and Means Committee to agree on a bill granting the temporaryrelief which I have indicated. Such a reduction would directly affectmillions of taxpayers, release large sums for investment in new enterprise,stimulating industrial production and agricultural consumption, andindirectly benefiting every family in the whole country. These are myconvictions stated with full knowledge that it is for the Congress todecide whether they judge it best to make such a reduction or leave thesurplus for the present year to be applied to retirement of the war debt.That also is eventually tax reduction.PROTECTIVE TARIFFIt is estimated that customs receipts for the present fiscal year willexceed $615,000,000, the largest which were ever secured from that source.The value of our imports for the last fiscal year was $4,466,000,000, anincrease of more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law went intoeffect. Of these imports about 65 per cent, or, roughly, $2,900,000,000,came in free of duty, which means that the United States affords aduty free market to other countries almost equal in value to the totalimports of Germany and greatly exceeding the total imports of France. Wehave admitted a greater volume of free imports than any other countryexcept England.We are, therefore, levying duties on about $1,550,000,000 of imports.Nearly half of this, or $700,000,000, is subject to duties for theprotection of agriculture and have their origin in countries other thanEurope. They substantially increased the prices received by our farmers fortheir produce. About $300,000.000 more is represented by luxuries such ascostly rugs, furs, precious stones, etc. This leaves only about$550,000,000 of our imports under a schedule of duties which is in generalunder consideration when there is discussion of lowering the tariff. Whilethe duties on this small portion, representing only about 12 per cent ofour imports, undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree ofprosperity or marked depression to many of our industries and thedifference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many ofour wage earners, it is impossible to conceive how other countries or ourown importers could be greatly benefited if these duties are reduced. Thosewho are starting an agitation for a reduction of tariff duties, partly atleast for the benefit of those to whom money has been lent abroad, ought toknow that there does not seem to be a very large field within the area ofour imports in which probable reductions would be advantageous to foreigngoods. Those who wish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely tosecure that result by continuing the present enormous purchasing powerwhich comes from our prosperity that increased our imports over 71per cent in four years than from any advantages that are likely to accruefrom a general tariff reduction.AGRICULTUREThe important place which agriculture holds in the economic and social lifeof the Nation can not be overestimated. The National Government isjustified in putting forth every effort to make the open country adesirable place to live. No condition meets this requirement which fails tosupply a fair return on labor expended and capital invested. While somelocalities and some particular crops furnish exceptions, in generalagriculture is continuing to make progress in recovering from thedepression of 1921 and 1922. Animal products and food products are in amore encouraging position, while cotton, due to the high prices of pastyears supplemented by ideal weather conditions, has been stimulated to apoint of temporary over production. Acting on the request of the cottongrowing interests, appointed a committee to assist in carrying out theirplans. As it result of this cooperation sufficient funds have been pledgedto finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bales of cotton. Whetherthose who own the cotton are willing to put a part of their stock into thisplan depends on themselves. The Federal Government has cooperated inproviding ample facilities. No method of meeting the situation would beadequate which does not contemplate a reduction of about one third in theacreage for the coming year. The responsibility for making the planeffective lies with those who own and finance cotton and cotton lands.The Department of Agriculture estimates the net income of agriculture forthe year 1920 21 at only $375,000,000; for 1924 25, $2,656,000,000; for1925 26, $2,757,000,000. This increase has been brought about in part bythe method already referred to, of Federal tax reduction, the eliminationof waste, and increased efficiency in industry. The wide gap that existed afew years ago between the index price of agricultural products and theindex price of other products has been gradually closing up, though therecent depression in cotton has somewhat enlarged it. Agriculture had onthe whole been going higher while industry had been growing lower.Industrial and commercial activities, being carried on for the most part bycorporations, are taxed at a much higher rate than farming, which iscarried on by individuals. This will inevitably make industrial commoditycosts high while war taxation lasts. It is because of this circumstancethat national tax reduction has a very large indirect benefit upon thefarmer, though it can not relieve him from the very great burden of thelocal taxes which he pays directly. We have practically relieved the farmerof any Federal income tax.There is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agriculturalindustry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war andthat further improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural productsis most desirable. There is belief also that the Federal Government canfurther contribute to these ends beyond the many helpful measures takenduring the last five years through the different acts of Congress foradvancing the interests of the farmers.The packers and stockyards act,Establishing of the intermediate credit banks for agricultural purposes,The Purnell Act for agricultural research,The Capper Volstead Cooperative Marketing Act,The cooperative marketing act of 1926,Amendments to the warehousing act,The enlargement of the activities of the Department of Agriculture,Enlargement of the scope of loans by the Farm Loan Board,The tariff on agricultural products,The large Federal expenditure in improvement of waterways and highways,The reduction of Federal taxes, in all comprise a great series ofgovernmental actions in the advancement of the special interest ofagriculture.In determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to methere are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoidingthem should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself.Acting upon my recommendation, the Congress has ordered the interstateCommerce Commission to investigate the freight rate structure, directingthat such changes shall be made in freight rates as will promote freedom ofmovement of agricultural products. Railroad consolidation which I amadvocating would also result in a situation where rates could be made moreadvantageous for farm produce, as has recently been done in the revision ofrates on fertilizers in the South. Additional benefit will accrue from thedevelopment of our inland waterways. The Mississippi River system carries acommerce of over 50,000,000 tons at a saving of nearly $18,000,000annually. The Inland Waterways Corporation operates boats on 2,500 miles ofnavigable streams and through its relation with 165 railroads carriesfreight into and out of 45 States of the Union. During the past six monthsit has handled over 1,000,000 bushels of grain monthly and by its lowerfreight rates has raised the price of such grain to the farmer probably21/2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. The highway system on which the FederalGovernment expends about $85,000,000 a year is of vital importance to therural regions.The advantages to be derived from a more comprehensive and less expensivesystem of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplemented byprovision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a lower cost than it isat present obtainable. This advantage we are attempting to secure by theproposed development at Muscle Shoals, and there are promising experimentsbeing made in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrates.A survey should be made of the relation of Government grazing lands to thelivestock industry. Additional legislation is desirable more definitely toestablish the place of grazing in the administration of the nationalforests, properly subordinated to their functions of producing timber andconserving the water supply. Over 180,000,000 acres of grazing lands arestill pastured as commons in the public domain with little or noregulation. This has made their use so uncertain that it has contributedgreatly to the instability of the livestock industry. Very little of thisland is suited to settlement or private ownership. Some plan ought to beadopted for its use in grazing, corresponding broadly to that alreadysuccessfully applied to the national forests.The development of sound and strong cooperative associations is offundamental importance to our agriculture. It is encouraging to note,therefore, that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movementis continuing. Cooperative associations reporting to the Department ofAgriculture at the end of 1925 had on their membership rolls a total of2,700,000 producers. Their total business in 1925 amounted to approximately$2,400,000,000, compared with $635,800,000 in 1915. Legislative action toassist cooperative associations and supplement their efforts was passed atthe last session of Congress. Important credit measures were also providedby Congress in 1923 which have been of inestimable value to the cooperativeassociations. Although the Federal credit agencies have served agriculturewell, I think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service ofthese institutions.Attention is again directed to the surplus problem of agriculture by thepresent cotton situation. Surpluses often affect prices of various farmcommodities in a disastrous manner, and the problem urgently demands asolution. Discussions both in and out of Congress during the past few yearshave given us a better understanding of the subject, and it is my hope thatout of the various proposals made the basis will be found for a sound andeffective solution upon which agreement can be reached. In my opinioncooperative marketing associations will be important aids to the ultimatesolution of the problem. It may well be, however, that additional measureswill be needed to supplement their efforts. I believe all will agree thatsuch measures should not conflict with the best interests of thecooperatives, but rather assist and strengthen them. In working out thisproblem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting theGovernment into the business of production or marketing or attempting toenact legislation for the purpose of price fixing. The farmer does notfavor any attempted remedies that partake of these elements. He has asincere and candid desire for assistance. If matched by an equally sincereand candid consideration of the different remedies proposed a soundmeasure of relief ought to result. It is unfortunate that no generalagreement has been reached by the various agricultural interests upon anyof the proposed remedies. Out of the discussion of various proposals whichcan be had before the Committees of Agriculture some measure ought to beperfected which would be generally satisfactory.Due to the emergency arising from a heavy tropical storm in southernFlorida, I authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use certain funds inanticipation of legislation to enable the farmers in that region to planttheir crops. The department will present a bill ratifying the loans whichwere made for this purpose.Federal legislation has been adopted authorizing the cooperation of theGovernment with States and private owners in the protection of forest landsfrom fire. This preventive measure is of such great importance that I haverecommended for it an increased appropriation.Another preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance is theeradication of tuberculosis in cattle. Active work is now in progress inone fourth of the counties of the United States to secure this result. Over12,000,000 cattle have been under treatment, and the average degree ofinfection has fallen from 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent. he FederalGovernment is making substantial expenditures for this purpose.Serious damage is threatened to the corn crop by the European corn borer.Since 1917 it has spread from eastern New England westward into Indiana andnow covers about 100,000 square miles. It is one of the most formidablepests because it spreads rapidly and is exceedingly difficult of control.It has assumed a menace that is of national magnitude and warrants theFederal Government in extending its cooperation to the State and localagencies which are attempting to prevent its further spread and secure itseradication.The whole question of agriculture needs most careful consideration. In thepast few years the Government has given this subject more attention thanany other and has held more consultations in relation to it than on anyother subject. While the Government is not to be blamed for failure toperform the impossible, the agricultural regions are entitled to know thatthey have its constant solicitude and sympathy. Many of the farmers areburdened with debts and taxes which they are unable to carry. We areexpending in this country many millions of dollars each year to increasefarm production. We ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farmmarketing. If a sound solution of a permanent nature can be found for thisproblem, the Congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it.DEVELOPMENT OF WATER RESOURCESIn previous messages I have referred to the national importance of theproper development of our water resources. The great projects of extensionof the Mississippi system, the protection an development of the lowerColorado River, are before Congress, and I have previously commented uponthem. I favor the necessary legislation to expedite these projects.Engineering studies are being made for connecting the Great Lakes with theNorth Atlantic either through an all American canal or by way of the St.Lawrence River. These reports will undoubtedly be before the Congressduring its present session. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the greatimportance of such a waterway not only to our mid continental basin but tothe commerce and development of practically the whole Nation. Our river andharbor improvement should be continued in accordance with the presentpolicy. Expenditure of this character is compatible with economy; it is inthe nature of capital investment. Work should proceed on the basic trunklines if this work is to be a success. If the country will be content to bemoderate and patient and permit improvements to be made where they will dothe greatest general good, rather than insisting on expenditures at thistime on secondary projects, our internal Waterways can be made a success.If proposes legislation results in a gross manifestation of localjealousies and selfishness, this program can not be carried out. Ultimatelywe can take care of extensions, but our first effort should be confined tothe main arteries.Our inland commerce has been put to great inconvenience and expense byreason of the lowering of the water level of the Great Lakes. This is aninternational problem on which competent engineers are making reports. Outof their study it is expected that a feasible method will be developed forraising the level to provide relief for our commerce and supply water fordrainage. Whenever a practical plan is presented it ought to be speedilyadopted.RECLAMATIONIt is increasingly evident that the Federal Government must in the futuretake a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation withincidental power for the development of the irrigable lands of the andregion. The unused waters of the West are found mainly in large rivers.Works to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that theyare not attractive to private enterprise. Water is the irreplaceablenatural resource. Its precipitation can not be increased. Its storage onthe higher reaches of streams, to meet growing needs, to be used repeatedlyas it flows toward the seas, is a practical and prudent business policy.The United States promises to follow the course of older irrigationcountries, where recent important irrigation developments have been carriedout as national undertakings. It is gratifying, therefore, that conditionson Federal reclamation projects have become satisfactory. The gross valueof crop, grown with water from project works increased from $110,000,000in 1924 to $131,000,000 in 1925. The adjustments made last year by Congressrelieved irrigators from paying construction costs on unprofitable land,and by so doing inspired new hope and confidence in ability to meet thepayments required. Construction payments by water users last year were thelargest in the history of the bureau.The anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorbed for a number ofyears in the completion of old projects and the construction of projectsinaugurated in the past three years. We should, however, continue toinvestigate and study the possibilities of a carefully planned developmentof promising projects, logically of governmental concern because of theirphysical magnitude, immense cost, and the interstate and internationalproblems involved. Only in this way may we be fully prepared to meetintelligently the needs of our fast growing population in the years tocome.TRANSPORTATIONIt would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contributesmore to the necessities and conveniences of life than transportation.Without it our present agricultural production and practically all of ourcommerce would be completely prostrated. One of the large contributingcauses to the present highly satisfactory state of our economic conditionis the prompt and dependable service, surpassing all our previous records,rendered by the railroads. This power has been fostered by the spirit ofcooperation between Federal and State regulatory commissions. To renderthis service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientificregulation, the process of valuing railroad properties should be simplifiedand the primary valuations should be completed as rapidly as possible. Theproblem of rate reduction would be much simplified by a process of railroadconsolidations. This principle has already been adopted as Federal law.Experience has shown that a more effective method must be provided. Studieshave already been made and legislation introduced seeking to promote thisend. It would be of great advantage if it could be taken up at once andspeedily enacted. The railroad systems of the country and the convenienceof all the people are waiting on this important decision.MERCHANT MARINEIt is axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get thefull benefit of its own advantages without a merchant marine. We have beenproceeding under the act of Congress that contemplates the establishment oftrade routes to be ultimately transferred to private ownership andoperation. Due to temporary conditions abroad and at home we have a largedemand just now for certain types of freight vessels. Some suggestion hasbeen made for new construction. I do not feel that we are yet warranted inentering, that field. Such ships as we might build could not be sold afterthey are launched for anywhere near what they would cost. We have expendedover $250,000,000 out of the public Treasury in recent years to make up thelosses of operation, not counting the depreciation or any cost whatever ofour capital investment. The great need of our merchant marine is not formore ships but for more freight.Our merchants are altogether too indifferent about using American ships forthe transportation of goods which they send abroad or bring home. Some ofour vessels necessarily need repairs, which should be made. I do notbelieve that the operation of our fleet is as economical and efficient asit could be made if placed under a single responsible head, leaving theShipping Board free to deal with general matters of policy and regulation.RADIO LEGISLATIONThe Department of Commerce has for some years urgently presented thenecessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listeners frominterference between broadcasting stations and to carry out otherregulatory functions. Both branches of Congress at the last session passedenactments intended to effect such regulation, but the two bills yet remainto be brought into agreement and final passage.Due to decisions of the courts, the authority of the department under thelaw of 1912 has broken down; many more stations have been operating thancan be accommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available;further stations are in course of construction; many stations have departedfrom the scheme of allocation set down by the department, and the wholeservice of this most important public function has drifted into such chaosas seems likely, if not remedied, to destroy its great value. I mosturgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enacted.I do not believe it is desirable to set up further independent agencies inthe Government. Rather I believe it advisable to entrust the importantfunctions of deciding who shall exercise the privilege of radiotransmission and under what conditions, the assigning of wave lengths anddetermination of power, to a board to be assembled whenever action on suchquestions becomes necessary. There should be right of appeal to the courtsfrom the decisions of such board. The administration of the decisions ofthe board and the other features of regulation and promotion of radio inthe public interest, together with scientific research, should remain inthe Department of Commerce. Such an arrangement makes for more expert, moreefficient, and more economical administration that an independent agency orboard, whose duties, after initial stages, require but little attention, inwhich administrative functions are confused with semijudicial functions andfrom which of necessity there must be greatly increased personnel andexpenditure.THE WAGE EARNERThe great body of our people are made up of wage earners. Several hundredthousands of them are on the pay rolls of the United States Government.Their condition very largely is fixed by legislation. We have recentlyprovided increases in compensation under a method of reclassification andgiven them the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support fortheir declining years. Most of them are under the merit system, which is aguaranty of their intelligence, and the efficiency of their service is ademonstration of their loyalty. The Federal Government should continue toset a good example for all other employers.In the industries the condition of the wage earner has steadily improved.The 12 hour day is almost entirely unknown. Skilled labor is wellcompensated. But there are unfortunately a multitude of workers who havenot yet come to share in the general prosperity of the Nation. Both thepublic authorities and private enterprise should be solicitous to advancethe welfare of this class. The Federal Government has been seeking tosecure this end through a protective tariff, through restrictiveimmigration, through requiring safety devices for the prevention ofaccidents, through the granting of workman\'s compensation, through civilianvocational rehabilitation and education, through employment informationbureaus, and through such humanitarian relief as was provided in thematernity and infancy legislation. It is a satisfaction to report that amore general condition of contentment exists among wage earners and thecountry is more free from labor disputes than it has been for years. Whilerestrictive immigration has been adopted in part for the benefit of thewage earner, and in its entirety for the benefit of the country, it oughtnot to cause a needless separation of families and dependents from theirnatural source of support contrary to the dictates of humanity.BITUMINOUS COALNo progress appears to have been made within large areas of the bituminouscoal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which greaterassurance can be given to the public of peaceful adjustment of wagedifficulties such as has been accomplished in the anthracite industry. Thisbituminous industry is one of primary necessity and bears a greatresponsibility to the Nation for continuity of supplies. As the wageagreements in the unionized section of the industry expire on April 1 next,and as conflicts may result which may imperil public interest, and have formany years often called for action of the Executive in protection of thepublic, I again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assistthe Executive in dealing with such emergencies through a special temporaryboard of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agencies forthe purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumers of coalfrom profiteering. At present the Executive is not only without authorityto act but is actually prohibited by law from making any expenditure tomeet the emergency of a coal famine.JUDICIARYThe Federal courts hold a high position in the administration of justice inthe world. While individual judicial officers have sometimes been subjectedto just criticism, the courts as a whole have maintained an exceedinglyhigh standard. The Congress may well consider the question of supplyingfair salaries and conferring upon the Supreme Court the same rule makingpower on the law side of the district courts that they have alwayspossessed on the equity side. A bill is also pending providing forretirement after a certain number of years of service, although they havenot been consecutive, which should have your favorable consideration. Thesefaithful servants of the Government are about the last that remain to beprovided for in the postwar readjustments.BANKINGThere has been pending in Congress for nearly three years bankinglegislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase thepowers of the national banks. I believe that within the limitation of soundbanking principles Congress should now and for the future place thenational banks upon a fair equality with their competitors, the Statebanks, and I trust that means may be found so that the differences onbranch banking legislation between the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives may be settled along sound lines and the legislationpromptly enacted.It would be difficult to overestimate the service which the Federal reservesystem has already rendered to the country. It is necessary only to recallthe chaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the Federalreserve system was put into operation. The old system consisted of a vastnumber of independent banking units, with scattered bank reserves whichnever could be mobilized in times of greatest need. In spite of vastbanking resources, there was no coordination of reserves or any creditelasticity. As a consequence, a strain was felt even during crop movingperiods and when it was necessary to meet other seasonal and regularlyrecurring needs.The Federal reserve system is not a panacea for all economic or financialills. It can not prevent depression in certain industries which areexperiencing overexpansion of production or contraction of their markets.Its business is to furnish adequate credit and currency facilities. This ithas succeeded in doing, both during the war and in the more difficultperiod of deflation and readjustment which followed. It enables us to lookto the future with confidence and to make plans far ahead, based on thebelief that the Federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influenceon credit conditions and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reactionsfrom the period of prosperity which we are now enjoying. In order thatthese plans may go forward, action should be taken at the present sessionon the question of renewing the banks\' charters and thereby insuring acontinuation of the policies and present usefulness of the Federal reservesystem.FEDERAL REGULATIONI am in favor of reducing, rather than expanding, Government bureaus whichseek to regulate and control the business activities of the people.Everyone is aware that abuses exist and will exist so long as we arelimited by human imperfections. Unfortunately, human nature can not bechanged by an act of the legislature. When practically the sole remedy formany evils lies in the necessity of the people looking out for themselvesand reforming their own abuses, they will find that they are relying on afalse security if the Government assumes to hold out the promise that it islooking out for them and providing reforms for them. This principle ispreeminently applicable to the National Government. It is too much assumedthat because an abuse exists it is the business of the National Governmentto provide a remedy. The presumption should be that it is the business oflocal and State governments. Such national action results in encroachingupon the salutary independence of the States and by undertaking tosupersede their natural authority fills the land with bureaus anddepartments which are undertaking to do what it is impossible for them toaccomplish and brings our whole system of government into disrespect anddisfavor. We ought to maintain high standards. We ought to punishwrongdoing. Society has not only the privilege but the absolute duty ofprotecting itself and its individuals. But we can not accomplish this endby adopting a wrong method. Permanent success lies in local, rather thannational action. Unless the locality rises to its own requirements, thereis an almost irresistible impulse for the National Government to intervene.The States and the Nation should both realize that such action is to beadopted only as a last resort.THE NEGROThe social well being of our country requires our constant effort for theamelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equalopportunity and equal protection under the laws which are guaranteed bythe. Constitution. The Federal Government especially is charged with thisobligation in behalf of the colored people of the Nation. Not only theirremarkable progress, their devotion and their loyalty, but, our duty toourselves under our claim that we are an enlightened people requires us touse all our power to protect them from the crime of lynching. Althoughviolence of this kind has very much decreased, while any of it remains wecan not justify neglecting to make every effort to eradicate it by law.The education of the colored race under Government encouragement isproceeding successfully and ought to have continuing support. An increasingneed exists for properly educated and trained medical skill to be devotedto the service of this race.INSULAR POSSESSIONSThis Government holds in sacred trusteeship islands which it has acquiredin the East and West Indies. In all of them the people are more prosperousthan at any previous time. A system of good roads, education, and generaldevelopment is in progress. The people are better governed than ever beforeand generally content.In the Philippine Islands Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood has been Governor Generalfor five years and has administered his office with tact and abilitygreatly to the success of the Filipino people. These are a proud andsensitive race, who are making such progress with our cooperation that wecan view the results of this experiment with great satisfaction. As we areattempting to assist this race toward self government, we should look upontheir wishes with great respect, granting their requests immediately whenthey are right, yet maintaining a frank firmness in refusing when they arewrong. We shall measure their progress in no small part by their acceptanceof the terms of the organic law under which the islands are governed andtheir faithful observance of its provisions. Need exists for clarifying theduties of the auditor and declaring them to be what everyone had supposedthey were. We have placed our own expenditures under the supervision of theComptroller General. It is not likely that the expenditures in thePhilippine Islands need less supervision than our own. The Governor Generalis hampered in his selection of subordinates by the necessity of securing aconfirmation, which has oftentimes driven him to the expediency of usingArmy officers in work for which civilian experts would be much betterfitted. Means should be provided for this and such other purposes as he mayrequire out of the revenue which this Government now turns back to thePhilippine treasury.In order that these possessions might stiffer no seeming neglect, I haverecently sent Col. Carmi A. Thompson to the islands to make a survey incooperation with the Governor General to suggest what might be done toimprove conditions. Later, I may make a more extended report includingrecommendations. The economic development of the islands is very important.They ought not to be turned back to the people until they are bothpolitically fitted for self government and economically independent. Largeareas are adaptable to the production of rubber. No one contemplates anytime in the future either under the present or a more independent form ofgovernment when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense.For their economic advantage, for the employment of their people, and as acontribution to our power of defense which could not be carried on withoutrubber, I believe this industry should be encouraged. It is especiallyadapted to the Filipino people themselves, who might cultivate itindividually on a small acreage. It could be carried on extensively byAmerican capital in a way to furnish employment at good wages. I am opposedto the promotion of any policy that does not provide for absolute freedomon the part of the wage earners and do not think we should undertake togive power for large holdings of land in the islands against the oppositionof the people of the locality. Any development of the islands must besolely with the first object of benefiting the people of the islands. At anearly day, these possessions should be taken out from under all militarycontrol and administered entirely on the civil side of government.NATIONAL DEFENSEOur policy of national defense is not one of making war, but of insuringpeace. The land and sea force of America, both in its domestic and foreignimplications, is distinctly a peace force. It is an arm of the police powerto guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to ourcitizens abroad. No self respecting nation would neglect to provide an armyand navy proportionate to its population, the extent of its territory, andthe dignity of the place which it occupies in the world. When it isconsidered that no navy in the world, with one exception, approaches oursand none surpasses it, that our Regular Army of about 115,000 men is theequal of any other like number of troops, that our entire permanent andreserve land and sea force trained and training consists of a personnel ofabout 610,000, and that our annual appropriations are about $680,000,000 ayear, expended under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff, itcan not be said that our country is neglecting its national defense. It istrue that a cult of disparagement exists, but that candid examination madeby the Congress through its various committees has always reassured thecountry and demonstrated that it is maintaining the most adequate defensiveforces in these present years that it has ever supported in time of peace.This general policy should be kept in effect. Here and there temporarychanges may be made in personnel to meet requirements in other directions.Attention should be given to submarines, cruisers, and air forces.Particular points may need strengthening, but as a whole our military poweris sufficient.The one weak place in the whole line is our still stupendous war debt. Inany modern campaign the dollars are the shock troops. With a depletedtreasury in the rear, no army can maintain itself in the field. A countryloaded with debt is a country devoid of the first line of defense. Economyis the handmaid of preparedness. If we wish to be able to defend ourselvesto the full extent of our power in the future, we shall discharge as soonas possible the financial burden of the last war. Otherwise we would face acrisis with a part of our capital resources already expended.The amount and kind of our military equipment is preeminently a questionfor the decision of the Congress, after giving due consideration to theadvice of military experts and the available public revenue. Nothing ismore laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrialresources of the country for the purpose of supplying the needs of nationaldefense. In time of peril the people employed in these interestsvolunteered in a most self sacrificing way, often at the nominal charge ofa dollar a year. But the Army and Navy are not supported for the benefit ofsupply concerns; supply concerns are supported for the benefit of the Armyand Navy. The distribution of orders on what is needed from differentconcerns for the purpose of keeping up equipment and organization isperfectly justified, but any attempt to prevail upon the Government topurchase beyond its needs ought not to be tolerated. It is eminently fairthat those who deal with the Government should do so at a reasonableprofit. However, public money is expended not that some one may profit byit, but in order to serve a public purpose.While our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may beindependent and self sufficient, I am opposed to engaging in any attempt atcompetitive armaments. No matter how much or how little some other countrymay feel constrained to provide, we can well afford to set the example, notof being dictated to by others, but of adopting our own standards. We arestrong enough to pursue that method, which will be a most wholesome modelfor the rest of the world. We are eminently peaceful, but we are by nomeans weak. While we submit our differences with others, not to theadjudication of force, but of reason, it is not because we are unable todefend our rights. While we are doing our best to eliminate all resort towar for the purpose of settling disputes, we can not but remember that thepeace we now enjoy had to be won by the sword and that if the rights of ourcountry are to be defended we can not rely for that purpose upon anyone butourselves. We can not shirk the responsibility, which is the firstrequisite of all government, of preserving its own integrity andmaintaining the rights of its own citizens. It is only in accordance withthese principles that we can establish any lasting foundations for anhonorable and permanent peace.It is for these reasons that our country, like any other country, proposesto provide itself with an army and navy supported by a merchant marine. Yetthese are not for competition with any other power. For years we havebesought nations to disarm. We have recently expressed our willingness atGeneva to enter into treaties for the limitation of all types of warshipsaccording to the ratio adopted at the Washington Conference. This offer isstill pending. While we are and shall continue to be armed it is not as amenace, but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peacelovingpeople of the world. For us to do any less would be to disregard ourobligations, evade our responsibilities, and jeopardize our national honor.VETERANSThis country, not only because it is bound by honor but because of thesatisfaction derived from it, has always lavished its bounty upon itsveterans. For years a service pension has been bestowed upon the Grand Armyon reaching a certain age. Like provision has been made for the survivorsof the Spanish War. A liberal future compensation has been granted to allthe veterans of the World War. But it is in the case of the, disabled andthe dependents that the Government exhibits its greatest solicitude. Thiswork is being well administered by the Veterans\' Bureau. The mainunfinished feature is that of hospitalization. This requirement is beingrapidly met. Various veteran bodies will present to you recommendationswhich should have your careful consideration. At the last session weincreased our annual expenditure for pensions and relief on account of theveterans of three wars. While I approve of proper relief for all suffering,I do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time.ALIEN PROPERTYWe still have in the possession of the Government the alien property. Ithas always been the policy of America to hold that private enemy propertyshould not be confiscated in time of war. This principle we havescrupulously observed. As this property is security for the claims of ourcitizens and our Government, we can not relinquish it without adequateprovision for their reimbursement. Legislation for the return of thisproperty, accompanied by suitable provisions for the liquidation of theclaims of our citizens and our Treasury, should be adopted. If ourGovernment releases to foreigners the security which it holds forAmericans, it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguards formeeting American claims.PROHIBITIONThe duly authorized public authorities of this country have madeprohibition the law of the land. Acting under the Constitution the Congressand the legislatures of practically all the, States have adoptedlegislation for its enforcement. Some abuses have arisen which requirereform. Under the law the National Government has entrusted to the TreasuryDepartment the especial duty of regulation and enforcement. Suchsupplementary legislation as it requires to meet existing conditions shouldbe carefully and speedily enacted. Failure to support the Constitution andobserve the law ought not to be tolerated by public opinion. Especiallythose in public places, who have taken their oath to support theConstitution, ought to be most scrupulous in its observance. Officers ofthe Department of Justice throughout the country should be vigilant inenforcing the law, but local authorities, which had always been mainlyresponsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicating liquor,ought not to seek evasion by attempting to shift the burden wholly upon theFederal agencies. Under the Constitution the States are jointly chargedwith the Nation in providing for the enforcement of the prohibitionamendment. Some people do not like the amendment, some do not like otherparts of the Constitution, some do not like any of it. Those who entertainsuch sentiments have a perfect right to seek through legal methods for achange. But for any of our inhabitants to observe such parts of theConstitution as they like, while disregarding others, is a doctrine thatwould break down all protection of life and property and destroy theAmerican system of ordered liberty.FOREIGN RELATIONSThe foreign policy of this Government is well known. It is one of peacebased on that mutual respect that arises from mutual regard forinternational rights and the discharge of international obligations. It isour purpose to promote understanding and good will between ourselves andall other people. The American people are altogether lacking in anappreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surrounds theirinternational position. We have no traditional enemies. We are notembarrassed over any disputed territory. We have no possessions that arecoveted by others; they have none that are coveted by us. Our borders areunfortified. We fear no one; no one fears us. All the world knows that thewhole extent of our influence is against war and in favor of peace, againstthe use of force and in favor of negotiation, arbitration, and adjudicationas a method of adjusting international differences. We look with disfavorupon all aggressive warfare. We are strong enough so that no one can chargeus with weakness if we are slow to anger. Our place is sufficientlyestablished so that we need not be sensitive over trifles. Our resources,are large enough so that we can afford to be generous. At the same time weare a nation among nations and recognize a responsibility not only toourselves, but in the interests of a stable and enlightened civilization,to protect and defend the international rights of our Government and ourcitizens.It is because of our historical detachment and the generations ofcomparative indifference toward it by other nations that our public isinclined to consider altogether too seriously the reports that we arecriticized abroad. We never had a larger foreign trade than at the presenttime. Our good offices were never more sought and the necessity for ourassistance and cooperation was never more universally declared in any timeof peace. We know that the sentiments which we entertain toward all othernations are those of the most sincere friendship and good will and of allunbounded desire to help, which we are perfectly willing to have judged bytheir fruits. In our efforts to adjust our international obligations wehave met with a response which, when everything is considered, I believehistory will record as a most remarkable and gratifying demonstration ofthe sanctity with which civilized nations undertake to discharge theirmutual obligations. Debt settlements have been negotiated with practicallyall of those who owed us and all finally adjusted but two, which are, inprocess of ratification. When we consider the real sacrifice that will benecessary on the part of other nations, considering all theircircumstances, to meet their agreed payments, we ought to hold them inincreased admiration and respect. It is true that we have extended to themvery generous treatment, but it is also true that they have agreed to repayits all that we loaned to them and some interest.A special conference on the Chinese customs tariff provided for by thetreaty between the nine powers relating to the Chinese customs tariffsigned at Washington on February 6, 1922, was called by the ChineseGovernment to meet at Peking, on October 26, 1925. We participated in thisconference through fully empowered delegates and, with good will,endeavored to cooperate with the other participating powers with a view toputting into effect promises made to China at the Washington conference,and considering any reasonable proposal that might be made by the ChineseGovernment for the revision of the treaties on the subject of China\'stariff. With these aims in view the American delegation at the outset ofthe conference proposed to put into effect the surtaxes provided for by theWashington treaty and to proceed immediately to the negotiation of atreaty, which, among other things, was to make provision for the abolitionof taxes collected on goods in transit, remove the tariff restrictions inexisting treaties, and put into effect the national tariff law of China.Early in April of the present year the central Chinese Government wasousted from power by opposing warring factions. It became impossible underthe circumstances to continue the negotiations. Finally, on July 3, thedelegates of the foreign powers, including those of the United States,issued a statement expressing their unanimous and earnest desire to proceedwith the work of the conference at the earliest possible moment when thedelegates of the Chinese Government are in a position to resume discussionswith the foreign delegates of the problems before the conference. We areprepared to resume the negotiations thus interrupted whenever a Governmentrepresenting the Chinese people and acting on their behalf presents itself.The fact that constant warfare between contending Chinese factions hasrendered it impossible to bring these negotiations to a successfulconclusion is a matter of deep regret. Throughout these conflicts we havemaintained a position of the most careful neutrality. Our naval vessels inAsiatic waters, pursuant to treaty rights, have been used only for theprotection of American citizens.Silas H. Strawn, Esq., was sent to China as American commissioner tocooperate with commissioners of the other powers in the establishment of acommission to inquire into the present practice of extraterritorialjurisdiction in China, with a view to reporting to the Governments of theseveral powers their findings of fact in regard to these matters. Thecommission commenced its work in January, 1926, and agreed upon a jointreport which was signed on September 16, 1926. The commission\'s report hasbeen received and is being studied with a view to determining our futurepolicy in regard to the question of extraterritorial privileges undertreaties between the United States and China.The Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference met at Geneva onMay 18 and its work has been proceeding almost continuously since thatdate. It would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to theprogress that has been made. The commission has had before it acomprehensive list of questions touching upon all aspects of the questionof the limitation of armament. In the commission\'s discussions manydifferences of opinion have developed. However, I am hopeful that at leastsome measure of agreement will be reached as the discussions continue. TheAmerican representation on the commission has consistently tried to behelpful, and has kept before it the practical objective to which thecommission is working, namely, actual agreements for the limitation ofarmaments. Our representatives will continue their work in that direction.One of the most encouraging features of the commission\'s work thus far hasbeen the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority ofthe powers parties to the Washington treaty limiting naval armament uponmethods and standards for the comparison and further limitation of navalarmament. It is needless to say that at the proper time I shall be preparedto proceed along practical lines to the conclusion of agreements carryingfurther the work begun at the Washington Conference in 1921.DEPARTMENT REPORTSMany important subjects which it is impossible even to mention in the shortspace of an annual message you will find fully discussed in thedepartmental reports. A failure to include them here is not to be taken asindicating any lack of interest, but only a disinclination to stateinadequately what has been much better done in other documents.THE CAPITAL CITYWe are embarking on an ambitious building program for the city ofWashington. The Memorial Bridge is under way with all that it holds for useand beauty. New buildings are soon contemplated. This program shouldrepresent the best that exists in the art and science of architecture. Intothese structures which must be considered as of a permanent nature ought togo the aspirations of the Nation, its ideals expressed in forms of beauty.If our country wishes to compete with others, let it not be in the supportof armaments but in the making of a beautiful capital city. Let it expressthe soul of America. Whenever an American is at the seat of his Government,however traveled and cultured he may be, he ought to find a city of statelyproportion, symmetrically laid out and adorned with the best that there isin architecture, which would arouse his imagination and stir his patrioticpride. In the coming years Washington should be not only the art center ofour own country but the art center of the world. Around it should centerall that is best in science, in learning, in letters, and in art. These arethe results that justify the creation of those national resources withwhich we have been favored.AMERICAN IDEALSAmerica is not and must not be a country without ideals. They are uselessif they are only visionary; they are only valuable if they are practical. Anation can not dwell constantly on the mountain tops. It has to bereplenished and sustained through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiringvalleys. But its face ought always to be turned upward, its vision oughtalways to be fixed on high.We need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translatedinto terms of the home. We can not expect to be relieved from toil, but wedo expect to divest it of degrading conditions. Work is honorable; it isentitled to an honorable recompense. We must strive mightily, but havingstriven there is a defect in our political and social system if we are notin general rewarded with success. To relieve the land of the burdens thatcame from the war, to release to the individual more of the fruits of hisown industry, to increase his earning capacity and decrease his hours oflabor, to enlarge the circle of his vision through good roads and bettertransportation, to lace before him the opportunity for education both inscience and in art, to leave him free to receive the inspiration ofreligion, all these are ideals which deliver him from the servitude of thebody and exalt him to the service of the soul. Through this emancipationfrom the things that are material, we broaden our dominion over the thingsthat are spiritual.
Calvin Coolidge
Members of the Congress:It is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the stateof the Union in general is good. We are at peace. The country as a wholehas had a prosperity never exceeded. Wages are at their highest range,employment is plentiful. Some parts of agriculture and industry havelagged; some localities have suffered from storm and flood. But such losseshave been absorbed without serious detriment to our great economicstructure. Stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution isprevalent. Rates of interest for industry, agriculture, and government havebeen reduced. Savers and investors are providing capital for newconstruction in industry and public works. The purchasing power ofagriculture has increased. If the people maintain that confidence whichthey are entitled to have in themselves, in each other, and in America, acomfortable prosperity will continue.CONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMYWithout constructive economy in Government expenditures we should not nowbe enjoying these results or these prospects. Because we are not nowphysically at war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debtstill remains. The Nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by astern self denial in public expenditures, until we have conquered thedisabilities of our public finance. While our obligation to veterans anddependents is large and continuing, the heavier burden of the national debtis being steadily eliminated. At the end of this fiscal year it will bereduced from about $26,600,000,000 to about $17,975,000,000. Annualinterest, including war savings, will have been reduced from $1,055,000,000to $670,0001,000. The sacrifices of the people, the economy of theGovernment, are showing remarkable results. They should be continued forthe purpose of relieving the Nation of the burden of interest and debt andreleasing revenue for internal improvements and national development.Not only the amount, but the rate, of Government interest has been reduced.Callable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year theaverage rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fellbelow 4 per cent. Keeping the credit of the Nation high is a tremendouslyprofitable operation.TAX REDUCTIONThe immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is taxreduction. The annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is$212,000,000. Without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worthproposing. The three measures already enacted leave our Government revenueswhere they are not oppressive. Exemptions, have been increased until115,000,000 people make but 2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so thatfurther reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removinginequalities. The Secretary of the Treasury has recommended a measure whichwould give us a much better balanced system of taxation and withoutoppression produce sufficient revenue. It has my complete support.Unforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. Our probablesurplus for June 30, 1929, is small. A slight depression in business wouldgreatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation. Thepeople ought to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderateand fair taxes which might produce a deficit. We must keep our budgetbalanced for each year. That is the corner stone of our national credit,the trifling price we pay to command the lowest rate of interest of anygreat power in the world. Any surplus can be applied to debt reduction, anddebt reduction is tax reduction. Under the present circumstances it wouldbe far better to leave the rates as they are than to enact a bill carryingthe peril of a deficit. This is not a problem to be approached in a narrowor partisan spirit. All of those who participate in finding a reasonablesolution will be entitled to participate in any credit that accrues from itwithout regard to party. The Congress has already demonstrated that taxlegislation can be removed from purely political consideration into therealm of patriotic business principles.Any bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsiblefor raising, managing, and expending the finances of the Government. Ifspecial interests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the nationalneeds as a whole, with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries asengines of propaganda, are permitted to influence the withdrawal of theirproperty from taxation, we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust,bad for business, bad for the country, probably resulting in a deficit,with disastrous financial Consequences. The Constitution has given theMembers of the Congress sole authority to decide what tax measures shall bepresented for approval. While welcoming information from any quarter, theCongress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vitaland important to all the interests of the country as taxation.NATIONAL DEFENSEBeing a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, tomaintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in aform adapted solely to defense. It should be continued with a very generoussupply of officers and with the present base of personnel, subject tofluctuations which may be temporarily desirable.The five year program for our air forces is in keeping with this samepolicy and commensurate with the notable contributions of America to thescience of aeronautics. The provisions of the law lately enacted are beingexecuted as fast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stabledevelopment permit.While our Army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a highstate of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of itsimmediate expansion. The garrison ration has lately been increased.Recommendations for an appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made tothe previous Congress failed to pass. While most of the Army is wellhoused, some of it which is quartered in wartime training camps is becomingpoorly housed. In the past three years $12,533,000 have been appropriatedfor reconstruction and repairs, and an authorization has been approved of$22,301,000 for new housing, under which $8,070,000 has already beenappropriated. A law has also been passed, complying with the request of theWar Department, allocating funds received from the sale of buildings andland for housing purposes. The work, however, is not completed, so thatother appropriations are being recommended.Our Navy is likewise a weapon of defense. We have a foreign commerce andocean lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. We have outlyingterritory in the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studdedwith the richest cities in the world. We are responsible for the protectionof a large population and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon anypeople. We are charged with an international duty of defending the PanamaCanal. To meet these responsibilities we need a very substantial seaarmament. It needs aircraft development, which is being provided under thefive year program. It needs submarines as soon as the department decidesupon the best type of construction. It needs airplane carriers and amaterial addition to its force of cruisers. We can plan for the future andbegin a moderate building program.This country has put away the Old World policy of competitive armaments. Itcan never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense.We have one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity onour part for a limitation in naval armament. After most carefulpreparation, extending over months, we recently made every effort to securea three power treaty to the same end. We were granted much cooperation byJapan, but we were unable to come to an agreement with Great Britain. Whilethe results of the conference were of considerable value, they were mostlyof a negative character. We know now that no agreement can be reached whichwill be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part. Weare ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigations on thegeneral subject of limitation of armaments which have been started underthe auspices of the League of Nations.We have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete.Everyone knew that had a three power agreement been reached it would haveleft us with the necessity of continuing our building program. The failureto agree should not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwiseshould. Any future treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. Weshould enter on no competition. We should refrain from no needful program.It should be made clear to all the world that lacking a definite agreement,the attitude of any other country is not to be permitted to alter our ownpolicy. It should especially be demonstrated that propaganda will not causeus to change our course. Where there is no treaty limitation, the size ofthe Navy which America is to have will be solely for America to determine.No outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it. But it should beknown to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement. Itis a guaranty of peace and security at home, and when it goes abroad it isan instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens underinternational law, a refuge in time of disorder, and always the servant ofworld peace. Wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity increase.MERCHANT MARINEThe United States Government fleet is transporting a large amount offreight and reducing its drain on the Treasury. The Shipping Board isconstantly under pressure, to which it too often yields, to protect privateinterests, rather than serve the public welfare. More attention should begiven to merchant ships as an auxiliary of the Navy. The possibility ofincluding their masters and crews in the Naval Reserve, with somereasonable compensation, should be thoroughly explored as a method ofencouraging private operation of shipping. Public operation is not asuccess. No investigation, of which I have caused several to be made, hasfailed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transferto private ownership. Our exporters and importers are both indifferentabout using American ships. It should be our policy to keep our presentvessels in repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible, rather thanundertake any new construction. Their operation is a burden on the NationalTreasury, for which we are not receiving sufficient benefits.COMMERCIAL AVIATIONA rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. The Department of Commercehas charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction ofnational airways. Almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000miles more contemplated. Nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000miles more will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next July.Air mail contracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines. Daily airwayflying is nearly 15,000 miles and is expected to reach 25,000 miles earlynext year.Flights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. Over 900 airports,completed and uncompleted, have been laid out. The demand for aircraft hasgreatly increased. The policy already adopted by the Congress is producingthe sound development of this coming industry.WESTERN HEMISPHERE AIR MAILPrivate enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation serviceto Mexico and Central and South America. We are particularly solicitous tohave the United States take a leading part in this development. It isunderstood that the governments of our sister countries would be willing tocooperate. Their physical features, the undeveloped state of theirtransportation, make an air service especially adaptable to their usage.The Post Office Department should be granted power to make liberallong term contracts for carrying our mail, and authority should be given tothe Army and the Navy to detail aviators and planes to cooperate withprivate enterprise in establishing such mail service with the consent ofthe countries concerned. A committee of the Cabinet will later present areport on this subject.GOOD ROADSThe importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to beappreciated. The National Government has been making liberal contributionsto encourage their construction. The results and benefits have been verygratifying. National participation, however, should be confined totrunk line systems. The national tax on automobiles is now nearlysufficient to meet this outlay. This tax is very small, and on low pricedcars is not more than $2 or $3 each year.While the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire forimproved highways is not limited to our own country. It should and doesinclude all the Western Hemisphere. The principal points in Canada arealready accessible. We ought to lend our encouragement in any way we canfor more good roads to all the principal points in this hemisphere south ofthe Rio Grande. It has been our practice to supply these countries withmilitary and naval advisers, when they have requested it, to assist them innational defense. The arts of peace are even more important to them and tous. Authority should be given by law to provide them at their request withengineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges. In some ofthese countries already wonderful progress is being made in road building,but the engineering features are often very exacting and the financingdifficult. Private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loanssought by these countries to open such main lines of travel.This general subject has been promoted by the Pan American Congress ofHighways, which will convene again at Rio de Janeiro in July, 1928. It isdesirable that the Congress should provide for the appointment of delegatesto represent the Government of the United States.CUBAN PARCEL POSTWe have a temporary parcel post convention with Cuba. The advantage of itis all on our side. During 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels,weighing twenty four times as much, as we received. This convention wasmade on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting theimportation of cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3,000 enactedin 1866 to discourage smuggling, for which it has long been unnecessary.This law unjustly discriminates against an important industry of Cuba. Itsrepeal has been recommended by the Treasury and Post Office Departments.Unless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselvesdeprived of this large parcel post business after the 1st of next March,the date of the expiration of the convention, which has been extended uponthe specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless thislegislation was enacted. We purchase large quantities of tobacco made inCuba. It is not probable that our purchases would be any larger if this lawwas repealed, while it would be an advantage to many other industries inthe United States.INSULAR POSSESSIONSConditions in the Philippine Islands have been steadily improved.Contentment and good order prevail. Roads, irrigation works, harborimprovements, and public buildings are being constructed. Public educationand sanitation have been advanced. The Government is in a sound financialcondition. These immediate results were especially due to theadministration of Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood. The six years of his governorshipmarked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of theoutstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man. His death is a lossto the Nation and the islands.Greater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put intoadministration, if the Congress would undertake to expend, through itsappropriating power, all or a part of the customs revenues which are nowturned over to the Philippine treasury. The powers of the auditor of theislands also need revision and clarification. The government of the islandsis about 98 per cent in the hands of the Filipinos. An extension of thepolicy of self government will be hastened by the demonstration on theirpart of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially andefficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the Congress forthe government of the islands. It would be well for a committee of theCongress to visit the islands every two years.A fair degree of progress is being made in Porto Rico. Its agriculturalproducts are increasing; its treasury position, which has given muchconcern, shows improvement. I am advised by the governor that educationalfacilities are still lacking. Roads are being constructed, which herepresents are the first requisite for building schoolhouses. The loyaltyof the island to the United States is exceedingly gratifying. A memorialwill be presented to you requesting authority to have the governor electedby the people of Porto Rico. This was never done in the case of our ownTerritories. It is admitted that education outside of the towns is as yetvery deficient. Until it has progressed further the efficiency of thegovernment and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of anappointed governor. As it is not contemplated that any change should bemade immediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful study ofthe Congress.PANAMA CANALThe number of commercial ships passing through the Panama Canal hasincreased from 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927. The total amount of tollsturned into the Treasury is over $166,000,000, while all the operations ofthe canal have yielded a surplus of about $80,000,000. In order to provideadditional storage of water and give some control over the floods of theChagres River, it is proposed to erect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 atAlhajuela. It will take some five years to complete this work.AGRICULTUREThe past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition ofagriculture. Production is better balanced and without acute shortage orheavy surplus. Costs have been reduced and the average output of the workerincreased. The level of farm prices has risen while others have fallen, sothat the purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure. Theindividual farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since1921. He has adjusted his production and through cooperative organizationsand other methods improved his marketing. He is using authenticated factsand employing sound methods which other industries are obliged to use tosecure stability and prosperity. The old fashioned haphazard system isbeing abandoned, economics are being applied to ascertain the best adaptedunit of land, diversification is being promoted, and scientific methods arebeing used in production, and business principles in marketing.Agriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. The fact isthat economic progress never marches forward in a straight line. It goes inwaves. One part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes.Everybody wishes agriculture to prosper. Any sound and workable proposal tohelp the farmer will have the earnest support of the Government. Theirinterests are not all identical. Legislation should assist as manyproducers in as many regions as possible. It should be the aim to assistthe farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically. No planwill be of any permanent value to him which does not leave him standing onhis own foundation.In the past the Government has spent vast sums to bring land undercultivation. It is apparent that this has reached temporarily thesaturation point. We have had a surplus of production and a poor market forland, which has only lately shown signs of improvement. The main problemwhich is presented for solution is one of dealing with a surplus ofproduction. It is useless to propose a temporary expedient. What is neededis permanency and stability. Government price fixing is known to be unsoundand bound to result in disaster. A Government subsidy would work out in thesame way. It can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of thepeople to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the rest of thepeople want.Price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead ofdiminishing it. Putting the Government directly into business is merely acombination of subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure.These expedients would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what andhow much he should plant and where he should plant it, and what and howmuch he should sell and where he should sell it. The most effective meansof dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage. While thiscan not be done by the individual farmer, it can be done through theorganizations already in existence, through the information published bythe Department of Agriculture, and especially through banks and others whosupply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large.It is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperityfor all those who engage in farming. If acreage becomes overextended, theGovernment can not assume responsibility for it. The Government can,however, assist cooperative associations and other organizations in orderlymarketing and handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonalconditions, in order to save the producer from preventable loss. While itis probably impossible to secure this result at a single step, and muchwill have to be worked out by trial and rejection, a beginning could bemade by setting up a Federal board or commission of able and experiencedmen in marketing, granting equal advantages under this board to the variousagricultural commodities and sections of the country, giving encouragementto the cooperative movement in agriculture, and providing a revolving loanfund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing. Suchlegislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of thesurplus problem.This is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is alreadyfairly well financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimentalmarketing associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by theregularly established banks, as were the temporary operations of the WarFinance Corporation. Cooperative marketing especially would be providedwith means of buying or building physical properties.The National Government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from incometaxes by successive tax reductions, but State and local taxes haveincreased, putting on him a grievous burden. A policy of rigid economyshould be applied to State and local expenditures. This is clearly withinthe legislative domain of the States. The Federal Government has alsoimproved our banking structure and system of agricultural credits. Thefarmer will be greatly benefited by similar action in many States. TheDepartment of Agriculture is undergoing changes in organization in ordermore completely to separate the research and regulatory divisions, thateach may be better administered. More emphasis is being placed on theresearch program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for Stateexperiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research workof the department. It is in this direction that much future progress can beexpected.THE PROTECTIVE TARIFFThe present tariff rates supply the National Treasury with well over$600,000,000 of annual revenue. Yet, about 65 per cent of our imports comein duty free. Of the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties arelaid about 23 per cent consists of luxuries and agricultural products, andthe balance of about 12 per cent, amounting, to around $560,000,000 is madeup of manufactures and merchandise. As no one is advocating any materialreduction in the rates on agriculture or luxuries, it is only thecomparatively small amount of about $560,000,000 of other imports that arereally considered in any discussion of reducing tariff rates. While thisamount, duty free, would be large enough seriously to depress many lines ofbusiness in our own country, it is of small importance when spread over therest of the world.It is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry wouldbenefit agriculture. It would be interesting to know to what commodities itis thought this could be applied. Everything the farmer uses in farming isalready on the free list. Nearly everything he sells is protected. It wouldseem to be obvious that it is better for the country to have the farmerraise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreignmanufacturer. In one case our country would have only the farmer; in theother it would have the farmer and the manufacturer. Assuming that Europewould have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise, it isnot certain it would consume more food, or, if it did, that its purchaseswould be made in this country. Undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapestmarket, which is by no means ours. The largest and best and most profitablemarket for the farmer in the world is our own domestic market. Any greatincrease in manufactured imports means the closing of our own plants.Nothing would be worse for agriculture.Probably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactureswhile maintaining the rates on agriculture. A material reduction in eitherwould be disastrous to the farmer. It would mean a general shrinkage ofvalues, a deflation of prices, a reduction of wages, a general depressioncarrying our people down to the low standard of living in our competingcountries. It is obvious that this would not improve but destroy our marketfor imports, which is best served by maintaining our present highpurchasing power under which in the past five years imports have increased63 per cent.FARM LOAN SYSTEMIt is exceedingly important that the Federal land and joint stock landbanks should furnish the best possible service for agriculture. Certainjoint stock banks have fallen into improper and unsound practices,resulting in the indictment of the officials of three of them. More moneyhas been provided for examinations, and at the instance of the Treasuryrules and regulations of the Federal Farm Board have been revised. Earlylast May three of its members resigned. Their places were filled with menconnected with the War Finance Corporation. Eugene Meyer being designatedas Farm Loan Commissioner. The new members have demonstrated their abilityin the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of he WarFinance Corporation. Three joint stock banks have gone into receivership.It is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in orderto find a market for their bonds. A recent flotation was made at a recordlow rate of 4 per cent. Careful supervision is absolutely necessary toprotect the investor and enable these banks to exercise their chieffunction in serving agriculture.MUSCLE SHOALSThe last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of MuscleShoals. Development of other methods show that nitrates can probably beproduced at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. Extensiveinvestigation made by the Department of War indicates that the nitrateplants on this project are of little value for national defense and canprobably be disposed of within two years. The oxidation part of the plants,however, should be retained indefinitely. This leaves this project mostlyconcerned with power. It should, nevertheless, continue to be dedicated toagriculture. It is probable that this desire can be best served bydisposing of the plant and applying the revenues received from it toresearch for methods of more economical production of concentratedfertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its useon the farm. But in disposing of the property preference should be given toproposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizermanufacturing.FLOOD CONTROLFor many years the Federal Government has been building a system of dikesalong the Mississippi River for protection against high water. During thepast season the lower States were overcome by a most disastrous flood. Manythousands of square miles were inundated a great many lives were lost, muchlivestock was drowned, and a very heavy destruction of property wasinflicted upon the inhabitants. The American Red Cross at once went to therelief of the stricken communities. Appeals for contributions have broughtin over $17,000,000. The Federal Government has provided services,equipment, and supplies probably amounting to about $7,000,000 more.Between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by localrailroads, the States, and their political units. Credits have beenarranged by the Farm Loan Board, and three emergency finance corporationswith a total capital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to theextent of $12,000,000. Through these means the 700,000 people in theflooded areas have been adequately supported. Provision has been made tocare for those in need until after the 1st of January.The Engineering Corps of the Army has contracted to close all breaks in thedike system before the next season of high water. A most thorough andelaborate survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in areport with recommendations for future flood control, which will bepresented to the Congress. The carrying out of their plans will necessarilyextend over a series of years. They will call for a raising andstrengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway\'sand improvements for the benefit of navigation.Under the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one third ofthe cost of their construction. This has been a most extraordinaryconcession from the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where thegeneral rule has been that the land benefited should bear the entireexpense. It is true, of course, that the troublesome waters do notoriginate on the land to be reclaimed, but it is also true that such watershave a right of way through that section of the country and the land thereis charged with that easement. It is the land of this region that is to bebenefited. To say that it is unable to bear any expense of reclamation isthe same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. Because ofexpenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it seemsprobable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportionof cost which it should bear. But it is extremely important that it shouldpay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with someresponsibility for their cost, and the neighborhood where works areconstructed have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravaganceand securing a wise and economical expenditure of public funds.It is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. It hasbeen so treated from its inception. Our whole people have provided withgreat generosity for its relief. Most of the departments of the FederalGovernment have been engaged in the same effort. The governments of theafflicted areas, both State and municipal, can not be given too high praisefor the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue ofthe people. If the sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, theNational Government should not fail to provide generous relief. This,however, does not mean restoration. The Government is not an insurer of itscitizens against the hazard of the elements. We shall always have flood anddrought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, lightning and tidal wave,which are all too constant in their afflictions. The Government does notundertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under suchcircumstances. It is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding of publicworks and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress.The people in the flooded area and their representatives have approachedthis problem in the most generous and broad minded way. They should be metwith a like spirit on the part of the National government. This is all onecountry. The public needs of each part must be provided for by the publicat large. No required relief should be refused. An adequate plan should beadopted to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the peoplemay restore to productivity and comfort their fields and their towns.Legislation by this Congress should be confined to our principal and mostpressing problem, the lower Mississippi, considering tributaries only sofar as they materially affect the main flood problem. A definite Federalprogram relating to our waterways was proposed when the last Congressauthorized a comprehensive survey of all the important streams of thecountry in order to provide for their improvement, including flood control,navigation, power, and irrigation. Other legislation should wait pending areport on this survey. The recognized needs of the Mississippi should notbe made a vehicle for carrying other projects. All proposals fordevelopment should stand on their own merits. Any other method would resultin ill advised conclusions, great waste of money, and instead of promotingwould delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources.Very recently several of the New England States have suffered somewhatsimilarly from heavy rainfall and high water. No reliable estimate ofdamage has yet been computed, but it is very large to private and publicproperty. The Red Cross is generously undertaking what is needed forimmediate relief, repair and reconstruction of houses, restocking ofdomestic animals, and food, clothing, and shelter. A considerable sum ofmoney will be available through the regular channels in the Department ofAgriculture for reconstruction of highways. It may be necessary to grantspecial aid for this purpose. Complete reports of what is required willundoubtedly be available early in the session.INLAND NAVIGATIONThe Congress in its last session authorized the general improvementsnecessary to provide the Mississippi waterway system with bettertransportation. Stabilization of the levels of the Great Lakes and theiropening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be considered. Sincethe last session the Board of Engineers of the War Department has made areport on the proposal for a canal through the State of New York, and theJoint Board of Engineers, representing Canada and the United States, hasfinished a report on the St. Lawrence River. Both of these boards concludethat the St. Lawrence project is cheaper, affords a more expeditious methodof placing western products in European markets, and will cost less tooperate. The State Department has requested the Canadian Government tonegotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement. It will alsobe necessary to secure an agreement with Canada to put in works necessaryto prevent fluctuation in the levels of the Great Lakes.Legislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at Boulder Canyon onthe Colorado River, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation.A secondary result would be a considerable power development and a sourceof domestic water supply for southern California. Flood control is clearlya national problem, and water supply is a Government problem, but everyother possibility should be exhausted before the Federal Government becomesengaged in the power business. The States which are interested ought toreach mutual agreement. This project is in reality their work. If they wishthe Federal Government to undertake it, they should not hesitate to makethe necessary concessions to each other. This subject is fully discussed inthe annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. The Columbia RiverBasin project is being studied and will be one to be considered at somefuture time.The Inland Waterways Corporation is proving successful and especiallybeneficial to agriculture. A survey is being made to determine its futureneeds. It has never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened tonavigation it would then be necessary for the Federal Government to providethe navigation. Such a request is very nearly the equivalent of adeclaration that their navigation is not profitable, that the commoditieswhich they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some othermethod, in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to beexpended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted, butwould entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities ofprivate persons for less than cost.The policy is well established that the Government should open publichighways on land and on water, but for use of the public in their privatecapacity. It has put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with theexpectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into privatehands and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdrawn. Theproblems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken up byprivate enterprise, so that the public will have the advantage ofcompetition in service. It is expected that some of our lines can be sold,some more demonstration work done, and that with the completion of the Ohioproject a policy of private operation can be fully developed.PROHIBITIONAfter more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted asystem of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in anamendment to the Federal Constitution. In obedience to this mandate theCongress and the States, with one or two notable exceptions, have passedrequired laws for its administration and enforcement. This imposes upon thecitizenship of the country, and especially on all public officers, not onlythe duty to enforce, but the obligation to observe the sanctions of thisconstitutional provision and its resulting laws. If this condition could besecured, all question concerning prohibition would cease. The FederalGovernment is making every effort to accomplish these results throughcareful organization, large appropriations, and administrative effort.Smuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources of supply forillegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and criminalprosecution the process of enforcement is being applied. The same vigilanceon the part of local governments would render these efforts much moresuccessful. The Federal authorities propose to discharge their obligationfor enforcement to the full extent of their ability.THE NEGROHistory does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same lengthof time as that which has been accomplished by the Negro race in the UnitedStates since the Emancipation Proclamation. They have come up from slaveryto be prominent in education, the professions, art, science, agriculture,banking, and commerce. It is estimated that 50,000 of them are on theGovernment pay rolls, drawing about $50,000,000 each year. They have beenthe recipients of presidential appointments and their professional abilityhas arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that they have been intrustedwith the entire management and control of the great veterans hospital atTuskegee, where their conduct has taken high rank. They have shown thatthey have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have received.Nevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsideratetreatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. They haveespecially been made the target of the foul crime of lynching. For severalyears these acts of unlawful violence had been diminishing. In the lastyear they have shown an increase. Every principle of order and law andliberty is opposed to this crime. The Congress should enact any legislationit can under the Constitution to provide for its elimination.AMERICAN INDIANThe condition of the American Indian has much improved in recent years.Full citizenship was bestowed upon them on June 2, 1924, and appropriationsfor their care and advancement have been increased. Still there remainsmuch to be done.Notable increases in appropriations for the several major functionsperformed by the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Indians havemarked the last five years. In that time, successive annual increases inappropriations for their education total $1,804,325; for medical care,$578,000; and for industrial advancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more thanwould have been spent in the same period on the basis of appropriations for1923 and the preceding years.The needs along health, educational, industrial and social lines however,are great, and the Budget estimates for 1929 include still furtherincreases for Indian administration.To advance the time when the Indians may become self sustaining, it is mybelief that the Federal Government should continue to improve thefacilities for their care, and as rapidly as possible turn itsresponsibility over to the States.COALLegislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointmentby the President of a Board of Mediation and Conciliation in case of actualor threatened interruption of production is needed. The miners themselvesare now seeking information and action from the Government, which couldreadily be secured through such a board. It is believed that a thoroughinvestigation and reconsideration of this proposed policy by the Congresswill demonstrate that this recommendation is sound and should be adopted.PETROLEUM CONSERVATIONThe National Government is undertaking to join in the formation of acooperative committee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, toconsider what legislation by the States or by the Congress can be adoptedfor the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum. This hascome to be one of the main dependencies for transportation and power sonecessary to our agricultural and industrial life. It is expected thereport of this committee will be available for later congressional action.Meantime, the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior should makecertain leases of land belonging to the Osage Indians, in accordance withthe act of March 3, 1921, should be repealed. The authority to lease shouldbe discretionary, in order that the property of the Indians way not bewasted and the public suffer a future lack of supply.ALIEN PROPERTYUnder treaty the property held by the Alien Property Custodian was to beretained until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction ofAmerican claims. While still protecting the American claimants, in order toafford every possible accommodation to the nationals of the countries whoseproperty was held, the Congress has made liberal provision for the returnof a larger part of the property. All trusts under $10,000 were returned infull, and partial returns were made on the others. The total returned wasapproximately $350,000,000.There is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. The Mixed ClaimsCommission has made such progress in the adjudication of claims thatlegislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property,which should be done under conditions which will protect our Government andour claimants. Such a measure will be proposed, and I recommend itsenactment.RAILROAD CONSOLIDATIONIn order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its costto the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. Legislation isneeded to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements andarrangements for consolidation, always under the control and with theapproval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Pending this, no adequateor permanent reorganization can be made of the freight rate structure.Meantime, both agriculture and industry are compelled to wait for neededrelief. This is purely a business question, which should be stripped of alllocal and partisan bias and decided on broad principles and its merits inorder to promote the public welfare. A large amount of new construction andequipment, which will furnish employment for labor and markets forcommodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of thisimportant question. Delay is holding back the progress of our country.Many of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of theWashington traction companies.VETERANSThe care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of allmen. The yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about thecost of running the Federal Government, outside of the Post OfficeDepartment, before the World War. The Congress will have before itrecommendations of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, andother like organizations, which should receive candid consideration. Weshould continue to foster our system of compensation and rehabilitation,and provide hospitals and insurance. The magnitude of the undertaking isalready so large that all requests calling for further expenditure shouldhave the most searching scrutiny. Our present system of pensions is alreadysufficiently liberal. It was increased by the last Congress for Civil andSpanish War veterans and widows and for some dependents.It has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealingwith veterans\' relief be consolidated. This would bring many advantages. Itis recommended that the proper committees of the Congress make a thoroughsurvey of this subject, in order to determine if legislation to secure suchconsolidation is desirable.EDUCATIONFor many years it has been the policy of the Federal Government toencourage and foster the cause of education. Large sums of money areannually appropriated to carry on vocational training. Many millions gointo agricultural schools. The general subject is under the immediatedirection of a Commissioner of Education. While this subject is strictly aState and local function, it should continue to have the encouragement ofthe National Government. I am still of the opinion that much good could beaccomplished through the establishment of a Department of Education andRelief, into which would be gathered all of these functions under onedirecting member of the Cabinet.DEPARTMENT OF LABORIndustrial relations have never been more peaceful. In recent months theyhave suffered from only one serious controversy. In all others difficultieshave been adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settlecontroversies by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion. The welfareof women and children is being especially guarded by our Department ofLabor. Its Children\'s Bureau is in cooperation with 26 State boards and 80juvenile courts.Through its Bureau of Immigration it has been found that medicalexamination abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship.Some further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either thehusband or the wife is in this country, and granting more freedom for themigration of the North American Indian tribes is desirable.The United States Employment Service has enabled about 2,000,000 men andwomen to gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. Particularattention has been given to assisting men past middle life and in providingfield labor for harvesting agricultural crops. This has been made possiblein part through the service of the Federal Board for Vocational Education,which is cooperating with the States in a program to increase the technicalknowledge and skill of the wage earner.PUBLIC BUILDINGSConstruction is under way in the country and ground has been broken forcarrying out a public building program for Washington. We have reached atime when not only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of thepublic buildings of the Capital City should be given much attention. Itwill be necessary to purchase further land and provide the requiredcontinuing appropriations.HISTORICAL CELEBRATIONSProvision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of thebirth of George Washington. Suggestion has been made for the constructionof a memorial road leading from the Capital to Mount Vernon, which may wellhave the consideration of the Congress, and the commission intrusted withpreparations for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication ofthe complete writings of Washington and a series of writings by differentauthors relating to him.February 25, 1929. is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of thecapture of Fort Sackville, at Vincennes, in the State of Indiana. Thiseventually brought into the Union what was known as the NorthwestTerritory, embracing the region north of the Ohio River between theAlleghenies and the Mississippi River. This expedition was led by GeorgeRogers Clark. His heroic character and the importance of his victory aretoo little known and understood. They gave us not only this NorthwestTerritory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the Pacific. TheState of Indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of Fort Sackville as anational shrine. The Federal Government may well make some provision forthe erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point.FOREIGN RELATIONSIt is the policy of the United States to promote peace. We are a peacefulpeople and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustmentrather than by force. We have believed that peace can best be secured by afaithful observance on our part of the principles of international law,accompanied by patience and conciliation, and requiring of others a liketreatment for ourselves. We have lately had some difference with Mexicorelative to the injuries inflicted upon our nationals and their propertywithin that country. A firm adherence to our rights and a scrupulousrespect for the sovereignty of Mexico, both in accordance with the law ofnations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it is hoped will resolveall our differences without interfering with the friendly relationshipbetween the two Governments.We have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to China to protectthe lives and property of our citizens. Fortunately their simple presencethere has been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. But therehas been considerable loss of property. That unhappy country is torn byfactions and revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period.Meanwhile we are protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate withany government which may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people ofChina. They have always had our friendship, and they should especiallymerit our consideration in these days of their distraction and distress.We were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in Nicaragua. Ourmarine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property andprevented a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country bya reversion to a state of revolution. Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary ofWar, was sent there to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officersin effecting a settlement between the contending parties. This was done onthe assurance that we would cooperate in restoring a state of peace whereour rights would be protected by giving our assistance in the conduct ofthe next presidential election, which occurs in a few months. With thisassurance the population returned to their peacetime pursuits, with theexception of some small roving bands of outlaws.In general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improvedwithin the year. While having a due regard for our own affairs, theprotection of our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we canafford to be liberal toward others. Our example has become of greatimportance in the world. It is recognized that we are independent,detached, and can and do take a disinterested position in relation tointernational affairs. Our charity embraces the earth. Our trade is farflung. Our financial favors are widespread. Those who are peaceful andlaw abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, butthat they can rely on our moral support. Proposals for promoting the peaceof the world will have careful consideration. But we are not a people whoare always seeking for a sign. We know that peace comes from honesty andfair dealing, from moderation, and a generous regard for the rights ofothers. The heart of the Nation is more important than treaties. A spiritof generous consideration is a more certain defense than great armaments.We should continue to promote peace by our example, and fortify it by suchinternational covenants against war as we are permitted under ourConstitution to make.AMERICAN PROGRESSOur country has made much progress. But it has taken, and will continue totake, much effort. Competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishnessand arrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weakerpeoples will be many. All of these are embraced in the opportunity for truegreatness. They will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity, and aspirit of neighborly kindness. The forces of the universe are takinghumanity in that direction. In doing good, in walking humbly, in sustainingits own people in ministering to other nations, America will work out itsown mighty destiny.
Calvin Coolidge
To the Congress of the United States:No Congress of the United States ever assembled, on surveying the state ofthe Union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears atthe present time. In the domestic field there is tranquility andcontentment, harmonious relations between management and wage earner,freedom from industrial strife, and the highest record of years ofprosperity. In the foreign field there is peace, the good will which comesfrom mutual understanding, and the knowledge that the problems which ashort time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifestfriendship. The great wealth created by our enterprise and industry, andsaved by our economy, has had the widest distribution among our own people,and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the businessof the world. The requirements of existence have passed beyond the standardof necessity into the region of luxury. Enlarging production is consumed byan increasing demand at home and an expanding commerce abroad. The countrycan regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future withoptimism.The main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity andcharacter of the American people. They have had great faith, which theyhave supplemented with mighty works. They have been able to put trust ineach other and trust in their Government. Their candor in dealing withforeign governments has commanded respect and confidence. Yet theseremarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without theconstant cooperation and careful administration of the Federal Government.We have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as aconservation of our national resources. Wastefulness in public business andprivate enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy. This hasbeen accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more andmore under a reign of law. A rule of force has been giving way to a rule ofreason. We have substituted for the vicious circle of increasingexpenditures, increasing tax rates, and diminishing profits the charmedcircle of diminishing expenditures, diminishing tax rates, and increasingprofits.Four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system,abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others. Eachtime the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomesand profits that a surplus has been reduced. One third of the nationaldebt has been paid, while much of the other two thirds has been refunded atlower rates, and these savings of interest and constant economies haveenabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions. Underthis sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increasednearly 50 per cent, until it is estimated to stand well over$90,000,000,000. It gas been a method which has performed the seemingmiracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands ofthe taxpayers with scarcely any diminution of the Government revenue. Thatis constructive economy in the highest degree. It is the corner stone ofprosperity. It should not fail to be continued.This action began by the application of economy to public expenditure. Ifit is to be permanent, it must be made so by the repeated application ofeconomy. There is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at thistime. Last June the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the currentfiscal year of $94,000,000. Under my direction the departments began savingall they could out of their present appropriations. The last tax reductionbrought an encouraging improvement in business, beginning early inOctober, which will also increase our revenue. The combination of economyand good times now indicates a surplus of about $37,000,000. This is amargin of less than I percent on out, expenditures and makes it obviousthat the Treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in expendituresto be made before June 30. It is necessary therefore during the presentsession to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay, or if suchare absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue; otherwise, weshall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalancedbudget. For the first time during my term of office we face thatcontingency. I am certain that the Congress would not pass and I should notfeel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in thatfinancial disgrace.On the whole the finances of the Government are most satisfactory. Lastyear the national debt was reduced about $906,000,000. The refunding andretirement of the second and third Liberty loans have just been brought toa successful conclusion, which will save about $75,000,000 a year ininterest. The unpaid balance has been arranged in maturities convenientfor carrying out our permanent debt paying Program.The enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimatepublic need. The Government plant has been kept up and many improvementsare tinder way, while its service is fully manned and the generalefficiency of operation has increased. We have been enabled to undertakemany new enterprises. Among these are the adjusted compensation of theveterans of the World War, which is costing us $112,000,000 a year;amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds,$20,000,000; increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors includingflood control, $43,000,000; public buildings, $47,000,000. In 1928 we spent$50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property. These areexamples of a large list of items.FOREIGN RELATIONSWhen we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations, welikewise perceive peace and progress. The Sixth International Conference ofAmerican States was held at Habana last winter. It contributed to a betterunderstanding and cooperation among the nations\'. Eleven importantconventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed. Pursuant to the planthen adopted, this Government has invited the other 20 nations of thishemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration, which meets inWashington on December 10. All the nations have accepted and theexpectation is justified that important progress will be made in methodsfor resolving international differences by means of arbitration.During the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties, and 22 more aretinder negotiation.NICARAGUAWhen a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in Nicaragua, atthe earnest and repeated entreaties of its Government I dispatched ourMarine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens. Tocompose the contending parties, I sent there Col. Henry L. Stimson, formerSecretary of War and now Governor General of the Philippine Islands, whosecured an agreement that warfare should cease, a national election shouldbe held and peace should be restored. Both parties conscientiously carriedout this agreement, with the exception of a few bandits who later mostlysurrendered or left the country. President Diaz appointed Brig. Gen. FrankR. McCoy, United States Army, president of the election board, whichincluded also one member of each political party.A free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfullythat both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from thiscountry at the election four years hence, to which I have refrained frommaking any commitments, although our country must be gratified at such anexhibition of success and appreciation.Nicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in thedirection of peaceful self government.TACNA ARICAThe long standing differences between Chile and Peru have been sufficientlycomposed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange ofambassadors. Negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written forthe final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory.MEXICOOur relations with Mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any timesince their revolution. Many misunderstandings have been resolved and themost frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of allunsettled questions. It is exceedingly gratifying that Ambassador Morrowhas been able to bring our two neighboring countries, which have so manyinterests in common, to a position of confidence in each other and ofrespect for mutual sovereign rights.CHINAThe situation in China which a few months ago was so threatening as to callfor the dispatch of a large additional force has, been much composed. TheNationalist Government has established itself over the country andpromulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote thepolitical and economic welfare of the people. We have recognized thisGovernment, encouraged its progress, and have negotiated a treatyrestoring to China complete tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizensagainst discriminations. Our trade in that quarter is increasing and ourforces are being reduced.GREEK AND AUSTRIAN DEBTSPending before the Congress is a recommendation for the settlement of theGreek debt and the Austrian debt. Both of these are comparatively small andour country can afford to be generous. The rehabilitation of thesecountries awaits their settlement. There would also be advantages to ourtrade. We could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses therelief which Austria seeks. The Congress has already granted Austria along time moratorium, which it is understood will be waived and immediatepayments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended toother countries.PEACE TREATYOne of the most important treaties ever laid before the Senate of theUnited States will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at Paris,and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere,renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peacefulmeans for the adjustment of international differences. It is the mostsolemn declaration against war, the most positive adherence to peace, thatit is possible for sovereign nations to make. It does not supersede ourinalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake tocommit us before the event to any mode of action which the Congress mightdecide to be wise if ever the treaty should be broken. But it is a newstandard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightenedopinion of nations to prevent their governments from being forced intohostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities. Theobservance of this covenant, so simple and so straightforward, promises morefor the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated amongthe nations.NATIONAL DEFENSEThe first duty of our Government to its own citizens and foreigners withinits borders is the preservation of order. Unless and until that duty is meta government is not even eligible for recognition among the family ofnations. The advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent uponthat order among the people of different countries which we term peace. Toinsure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at homeand abroad, to preserve order, liberty, and peace by making the lawsupreme, we have an Army and a Navy.Both of these are organized for defensive purposes. Our Army could not bemuch reduced, but does not need to be increased. Such new housing andrepairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6 year program in aviationis being put into effect in both branches of our service.Our Navy, according to generally accepted standards, is deficient incruisers. We have 10 comparatively new vessels, 22 that are old, and 8 tobe built. It is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided.This matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the Congressand does not need restatement. The bill before the Senate with theelimination of the time clause should be passed. We have no intention ofcompeting with any other country. This building program is for necessaryreplacements and to meet our needs for defense.The cost of national defense is stupendous. It has increased $118,000,000in the past four years. The estimated expenditure for 1930 is $668,000,000.While this is made up of many items it is, after all, mostly dependent uponnumbers. Our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number ofmen in the Army or the Navy. We have reached the limit of what we ought toexpend for that purpose.I wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious thatthis country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic. Many people at homeand abroad, who constantly make this charge, are the same ones who are evenmore solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries. Whensuch assistance is granted, the inevitable result is that we have foreigninterests. For us to refuse the customary support and protection of suchinterests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this Nation. Ourlargest foreign interests are in the British Empire, France, and Italy.Because we are constantly solicitous for those interests, I doubt if anyonewould suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them anymilitaristic or imperialistic design. As for smaller countries, wecertainly do not want any of them. We are more anxious than they are to havetheir sovereignty respected. Our entire influence is in behalf of theirindependence. Cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle.The position of this Government relative to the limitation of armaments,the results already secured, and the developments up to the present timeare so well known to the Congress that they do not require any restatement.VETERANSThe magnitude of our present system of veterans\' relief is withoutprecedent, and the results have been far reaching. For years a servicepension has been granted to the Grand Army and lately to the survivors ofthe Spanish American War. At the time we entered the World War however,Congress departed from the usual pension system followed by ourGovernment. Eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted,initiating a system of compensation, rehabilitation, hospitalization, andinsurance for the disabled of the World War and their dependents. Theadministration of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficulttask, but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothingin their desire to deal generously and humanely. We should continue tofoster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequatecare. It is the conception of our Government that the pension roll is anhonor roll. It should include all those who are justly entitled to itsbenefits, but exclude all others.Annual expenditures for all forms of veterans\' relief now approximate$765,000,000, and are increasing from year to year. It is doubtful if thepeak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation forsonic time yet to come. Further amendments to the existing law will besuggested by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of theUnited States, the Disabled American Veterans of the World War, and otherlike organizations, and it may be necessary for administrative purposes, orin order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law, to makefurther changes. I am sure that such recommendations its may be submittedto the Congress will receive your careful consideration. But because of thevast expenditure now being made, each year, with every assurance that itwill increase, and because of the great liberality of the existing law, theproposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject shouldreceive most searching scrutiny from the Congress.You are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies nowdealing with matters of veterans\' relief be consolidated in one Governmentdepartment. Some advantages to this plan seem apparent, especially in thesimplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing abouta greater uniformity in the application of veterans\' relief. I recommendthat a survey be made by the proper committees of Congress dealing withthis subject, in order to determine whether legislation to secure thisconsolidation is desirable.AGRICULTUREThe past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement inagriculture. The general purchasing power of farm products and the volumeof production have advanced. This means not only further progress, inovercoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in1920 21, but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and awell grounded confidence in the future of agriculture.The livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and isprospering conspicuously. Dairymen, beef producers, and poultrymen arereceiving substantially larger returns than last year. Cotton, althoughlower in price than at this time last year, was produced in greater volumeand the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable. But progress is neveruniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry. Cashgrains, hay, tobacco, and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns thisyear than last. Present indications are, however, that the gross farmincome will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927 28, when thetotal was $12,253,000,000. The corresponding figure for 1926 27 was$12,127,000,000, and in 1925 26, $12,670,000,000. Still better resultswould have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase inthe production of certain crops. This is particularly true of potatoes,which have sold at an unremunerative price, or at a loss, as a directresult of overexpansion of acreage.The present status of agriculture, although greatly improved over that of afew years ago, bespeaks the need of further improvement which calls fordetermined effort of farmers themselves, encouraged and assisted by wisepublic policy. The Government has been, and must continue to be, alive tothe needs of agriculture.In the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit toagriculture has been adopted than during any other period. The Departmentof Agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greaterefficiency. The department is laying greater stress on the economic andbusiness phases of agriculture. It is lending every possible assistance tocooperative marketing associations. Regulatory and research work have beensegregated in order that each field may be served more effectively.I can not too strongly commend, in the field of fact finding, the researchwork of the Department of Agriculture and the State experiment stations.The department now receives annually $4,000,000 more for research than in1921. In addition, the funds paid to the States for experimentationpurposes under the Purnell Act constitute an annual increase in Federalpayments to State agricultural experiment stations of $2,400,000 over theamount appropriated in 1921. The program of support for research may wiselybe continued and expanded. Since 1921 we have appropriated nearly anadditional $2,000,000 for extension work, and this sum is to be increasednext year under authorization by the Capper Ketcham Act.THE SURPLUS PROBLEMWhile these developments in fundamental research, regulation, anddissemination of agricultural information are of distinct help toagriculture, additional effort is needed. The surplus problem demandsattention. As emphasized in my last message, the Government should assumeno responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due tooverextended acreage. The Government should, however, provide reliableinformation as a guide to private effort; and in this connection fundamentalresearch on prospective supply and demand, as a guide to production andmarketing, should be encouraged. Expenditure of public funds to bring inmore new land should have most searching scrutiny, so long as our farmersface unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land alreadyunder cultivation.Every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it isadapted. The reforestation of land best suited for timber production isprogressing and should be encouraged, and to this end the forest taxationinquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy.Improvement has been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves, notonly to protect the ranges, but to preserve the soil from erosion. Similaraction is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are nowovergrazed and rapidly eroding.Temporary expedients, though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands ofthe moment, can not permanently solve the surplus problem and mightseriously aggravate it. Hence putting the Government directly intobusiness, subsidies, and price fixing, and the alluring promises ofpolitical action as a substitute for private initiative, should beavoided.The Government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handlingsurpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions. As a beginningthere should be created a Federal farm board consisting of able andexperienced men empowered to advise producers\' associations in establishingcentral agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses, to seekwore economical means of merchandising, and to aid the producer in securingreturns according to the a14 of his product. A revolving loan fund shouldbe provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall havedeveloped means of financing their operations through regularly constitutedcredit institutions. Such a bill should carry authority for raising themoney, by loans or otherwise, necessary to meet the expense, as theTreasury has no surplus.Agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effortwhich modern economic life demands. The cooperative movement, which isgradually building the needed organization, is in harmony with publicinterest and therefore merits public encouragement.THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATESImportant phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within thesphere of the States. While successive reductions in Federal taxes haverelieved most farmers of direct taxes to the National Government, State andlocal levies have become a serious burden. This problem needs immediate andthorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment.It will have to be made largely by the States themselves.COMMERCEIt is desirable that the Government continue its helpful attitude towardAmerican business. The activities of the Department of Commerce havecontributed largely to the present satisfactory positionin our international trade, which has reached about $9,000,000,000annually. There should be no slackening of effort in that direction. It isalso important that the department\'s assistance to domestic commerce becontinued. There is probably no way in which the Government can aid soundeconomic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our businessmen to reduce wastes in distribution.COMMERCIAL AERONAUTICSContinued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying. Demands forairplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing andinspection service of the Department of Commerce to their capacity. Whilethe compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only toequipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, aFederal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessaryqualifications. State legislation, local airport regulations, and insurancerequirements make such a license practically indispensable. This results inuniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation, which areessential to aeronautical development. Over 17,000 young men and women havenow applied for Federal air pilot\'s licenses or permits. More than 80 percent of them applied during the past year.Our national airway system exceeds 14,000 miles in length and has 7,500miles lighted for night operations. Provision has been made for lighting4,000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equalmileage with radio facilities. Three quarters of our people are now servedby these routes. With the rapid growth of air mail, express, and passengerservice, this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more importantfactor in commerce. It is noteworthy that this development has taken placewithout governmental subsidies. Commercial passenger flights operating onschedule have reached 13,000 miles per day.During the next fortnight this Nation will entertain the nations of theworld in a celebration of the twenty fifth anniversary of the firstsuccessful airplane flight. The credit for this epoch making achievementbelongs to a citizen of our own country, Orville Wright.CUBAN PARCEL POSTI desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message, that Congressenact the legislation necessary to make permanent the Parcel PostConvention with Cuba, both as a facility to American commerce and as ameasure of equity to Cuba in the one class of goods which that country cansend here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade."MAINE" BATTLESHIP MEMORIALWhen I attended the Pan American Conference at Habana, the President ofCuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that wasoverturned by a storm after it was erected on the Cuban shore to the memoryof the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship Maine. As atestimony of friendship and appreciation of the Cuban Government and peoplehe most generously offered to present this to the United States, and Iassured him of my pleasure in accepting it. There is no location in theWhite House for placing so large and heavy a structure, and I thereforeurge the Congress to provide by law for some locality where it can beset up.RAILROADSIn previous annual messages I have suggested the enactment of laws topromote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiencyof transportation and lessening its cost to the public. While,consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it ischanged, vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fullyadequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation. Amendmentsdesigned to remedy these defects have been considered at length by therespective committees of Congress and a bill was reported out late in thelast session which I understand has the approval in principle of theInterstate Commerce Commission. It is to be hoped that this legislation maybe enacted at an early date.Experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definitionand clarification in several other respects, some of which have beenpointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its annual reports tothe Congress. It will promote the public interest to have the Congress giveearly consideration to the recommendations there made.MERCHANT MARINEThe cost of maintaining the United States Government merchant fleet hasbeen steadily reduced. We have established American flag lines in foreigntrade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerceand as a naval auxiliary. There have been sold to private American capitalfor operation within the past few years 14 of these lines, which, under theencouragement of the recent legislation passed by the Congress, givepromise of continued successful operation. Additional legislation from timeto time may be necessary to promote future advancement under privatecontrol.Through the cooperation of the Post Office Department and the ShippingBoard long term contracts are being made with American steamship lines forcarrying mail, which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 newvessels and the gradual reestablishment of the American merchant marine asa private enterprise. No action of the National Government has been sobeneficial to our shipping. The cost is being absorbed to a considerableextent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the ShippingBoard, for which the new law has made a market. Meanwhile it should be ourpolicy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the Government operationuntil they can be transferred to private capital.INTER AMERICAN HIGHWAYIn my message last year I expressed the view that we should lend ourencouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on thishemisphere South of the Rio Grande. My view has not changed.The Pan American Union has recently indorsed it. In some of the countriesto the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building. In,Others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult. Asthose countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready tocontribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier ofaccomplishment. I prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end.We already furnish military and naval advisors, and following thisprecedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from theDepartment of Agriculture.We should provide our southern neighbors, if they request it, with suchengineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges. Privateinterests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought bythese countries to open main lines of travel. Such assistance should begiven especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all thecountries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate, intercourse and closerrelations among, them.AIR MAIL SERVICEThe friendly relations and the extensive, commercial intercourse with theWestern Hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by theestablishment and extension of air mail routes. We shall soon have one fromKey West, Fla., over Cuba, Haiti, and Santo Domingo to San Juan, P. R.,where it will connect with another route to Trinidad. There will be anotherroute from Key West to the Canal Zone, where connection will be made with aroute across the northern coast of South America to Paramaribo. This willgive us a circle around the Caribbean under our own control. Additionalconnections will be made at Colon with a route running down the west coastof South America as far as Conception, Chile, and with the French air mailat Paramaribo running down the eastern coast of South America. The airservice already spans our continent, with laterals running to Mexico andCanada, and covering a daily flight of over 28,000 miles, with an averagecargo of 15 000 pounds.WATERWAYSOur river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor. In the pastfew years Ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work$28,000,000, besides what is to be expended on flood control. The totalappropriation for this year was over $91,000,000. The Ohio River is almostready for opening; work on the Missouri and other rivers is under way. Inaccordance with the Mississippi flood law Army engineers are makinginvestigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with aview to flood control, navigation, waterpower, and irrigation. Our barrierlines are being operated under generous appropriations, and negotiationsare developing relative to the St. Lawrence waterway. To Secure the largestbenefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with therailroads, preferably by agreement, but otherwise as a result ofcongressional action.We have recently passed several river and harbor bills. The work ordered bythe Congress not, yet completed, will cost about $243,000,000, besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the Mississippiflood way. Until we can see our way out of this expense no further riverand harbor legislation should be passed, as expenditures to put it intoeffect would be four or five years away.IRRIGATION OF ARID LANDSFor many years the Federal Government has been committed to the wise policyof reclamation and irrigation. While it has met with some failures due tounwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys, so thatthey could not be placed on a sound business basis, on the whole theservice has been of such incalculable benefit in so many States that no onewould advocate its abandonment. The program to which we are alreadycommitted, providing for the construction of new projects authorized byCongress and the completion of old projects, will tax the resources of thereclamation fund over a period of years. The high cost of improving andequipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacantfarms on federal projects.Readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of May 25, 1926,have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers. These newfinancial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projectshave resulted in increased collections by the Department of the Interior ofcharges due the reclamation fund. Nevertheless, the demand for stillsmaller yearly payments on some projects continues. These conditions shouldhave consideration in connection with any proposed new projects.COLORADO RIVERFor several years the Congress has considered the erection of a dam on theColorado River for flood control, irrigation, and domestic water purposes,all of which ma properly be considered as Government functions. There wouldbe an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generatingelectricity. As private enterprise can very well fill this field, there isno need for the Government to go into it. It is unfortunate that the Statesinterested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves.Nevertheless, any legislation should give every possible safeguard to thepresent and prospective rights of each of them.The Congress will have before it, the detailed report of a special boardappointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of thisproject. From the short summary which I have seen of it, 11 judge theyconsider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased costover previous estimates. They prefer the Black Canyon site. On the economicfeatures they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on manyconditions which can not be established with certainty. So far as I canjudge, however, from the summary, their conclusions appear sufficientlyfavorable, so that I feel warranted in recommending a measure which willprotect the rights of the States, discharge the necessary Governmentfunctions, and leave the electrical field to private enterprise.MUSCLE SHOALSThe development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably renderthis plant less important for that purpose than formerly. But we have it,and I am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates fornational defense and farm fertilizers. By dividing the property into itstwo component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible todispose of the power, reserving the right to any concern that wished tomake nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose. Sucha disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rentalabout $2,000,000 per year. If the Congress would giant the Secretary of Warauthority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure thelargest production of nitrates, the entire property could begin tofunction. Such a division, I am aware, has never seemed to appeal to theCongress. I should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to leasethe entire property for the production of nitrates.I wish to avoid building another dam at public expense. Future operatorsshould provide for that themselves. But if they were to be required torepay the cost of such dam with the prevailing commercial rates forinterest, this difficulty will be considerably lessened. Nor do I thinkthis property should be made a vehicle for putting the United StatesGovernment indiscriminately into the private and retail field of powerdistribution and nitrate sales.CONSERVATIONThe practical application of economy to the resources of the country callsfor conservation. This does not mean that every resource should not bedeveloped to its full degree, but it means that none of them should bewasted. We have a conservation board working on our oil problem. This is ofthe utmost importance to the future well being of our people in this age ofoil burning engines and the general application of gasoline totransportation. The Secretary of the Interior should not be compelled tolease oil lands of the Osage Indians when the market is depressed and thefuture supply is in jeopardy.While the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small, comparedwith the vast area in private ownership, the natural resources of those inpublic ownership are of immense present and future value. This isparticularly trite as to minerals and water power. The proper bureaus havebeen classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved.Appropriate estimates are being submitted, in the Budget, for the furtherprosecution of this important work.IMMIGRATIONThe policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained. Authorityshould be granted the Secretary of Labor to give immediate preference tolearned professions and experts essential to new industries. The reunitingof families should be expedited. Our immigration and naturalization lawsmight well be codified.WAGE EARNERIn its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of alimitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because itwas the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it theAmerican conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production,which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity.Here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory thatonly by limiting individual production can there be any assurance ofpermanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management andwage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered anew era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacityof the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, theend of which is not yet. The application of this theory accounts for ourwidening distribution of wealth. No discovery ever did more to increase thehappiness and prosperity of the people.Since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 percent, while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 percent and 38 per cent. Even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over5 per cent and in woolen mills 8.4 per cent, although these industries havenot prospered like others. As the rise in living costs in this period isnegligible, these figures represent real wage increases.The cause of constructive economy requires that the Government shouldcooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising fromindustrial accidents. This item, with all that has been done to reduce it,still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman andgreat loss to the country.WOMEN AND CHILDRENThe Federal Government should continue its solicitous care for the8,500,000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health,which is reducing infant mortality and improving the bodily and mentalcondition of our citizens.CIVIL SERVICEThe most marked change made in the civil service of the Government in thepast eight years relates to the increase in salaries. The Board ofActuaries on the retirement act shows by its report, that July 1, 1921 theaverage salary of the 330,047 employees subject to the act was $1,307,while on June 30, 1927, the average salary of the corresponding 405,263was $1,969. This was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent. On topof this was the generous increase made at the last session of the Congressgenerally applicable to Federal employees and another bill increasing thepay in certain branches of the Postal Service beyond the large increasewhich was made three years ago. This raised the average level from $1,969to $2,092, making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent. While itis well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the Federalservice is much smaller than in private employment, in the lower brackets,ranging well up over $3,000, it is much higher. It is higher not only inactual money paid, but in privileges granted, a vacation of 30 actualworking days, or 5 weeks each year, with additional time running in somedepartments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisionsof the retirement act. No other body of public servants ever occupied sucha fortunate position.EDUCATIONThrough the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior theFederal Government, acting in an informative and advisory capacity, hasrendered valuable service. While this province belongs peculiarly to theStates, yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educationalmethods is a general responsibility of the Federal Government. A survey ofnegro colleges and universities in the United States has just beencompleted by the Bureau of Education through funds provided by theinstitutions themselves and through private sources. The present status ofnegro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for itsadvancement. This was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of thebureau. Following the invitation of the Association of Land Grant Collegesand Universities, he Bureau of Education now has under way the survey ofagricultural colleges, authorized by Congress. The purpose of the survey isto ascertain the accomplishments, the status, and the future objectives ofthis type of educational training. It is now proposed to undertake a surveyof secondary schools, which educators insist is timely and essential.PUBLIC BUILDINGSWe, have laid out a public building program for the District of Columbiaand the country at large running into hundreds of millions of dollars.Three important structures and one annex are already, under way and oneaddition has been completed in the City of Washington. in the country siteshave been acquired, many buildings are in course of construction, and someare already completed. Plans for all this work are being prepared in orderthat it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible. This is the greatestbuilding program ever assumed by this Nation. It contemplates structures ofutility and of beauty. When it reaches completion the people will be wellserved and the Federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful andstately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world.THE AMERICAN INDIANThe administration of Indian affairs has been receiving intensive study forseveral years. The Department of the Interior has been able to providebetter supervision of health, education, and industrial advancement of thisnative race through additional funds provided by the Congress. The presentcooperative arrangement existing between the Bureau of Indian Affairs andthe Public Health Service should be extended. The Government\'sresponsibility to the American Indian has been acknowledged by annualincreases in appropriations to fulfill its obligations to them and tohasten the time when Federal supervision of their affairs may be properlyand safely terminated. The movement in Congress and in some of the Statelegislatures for extending responsibility in Indian affairs to Statesshould be encouraged. A complete participation by the Indian in oureconomic life is the end to be desired.THE NEGROFor 65 years now our negro Population has been under the peculiar care andsolicitude of the National Government. The progress which they have made ineducation and the professions, in wealth and in the arts of civilization,affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of worldhistory. They have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantagesof our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independentexistence. Whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume,the status granted to them by the Constitution of this Union is beingrapidly dissipated. Their cooperation in the life of the Nation isconstantly enlarging.Exploiting the Negro problem for political ends is being abandoned andtheir protection is being increased by those States in which theirpercentage of population is largest. Every encouragement should be extendedfor t le development of the race. The colored people have been the victimsof the crime of lynching, which has in late years somewhat decreased. Someparts of the South already have wholesome laws for its restraint andpunishment. Their example might well be followed by other States, and bysuch immediate remedial legislation as the Federal Government can extendunder the Constitution.PHILIPPINE ISLANDSUnder the guidance of Governor General Stimson the economic and politicalconditions of the Philippine Islands have been raised to a standard neverbefore surpassed. The cooperation between his administration and the peopleof the islands is complete and harmonious. It would be an advantage ifrelief from double taxation could be granted by the Congress to ourcitizens doing business in the islands.PORTO RICODue to the terrific storm that swept Porto Rico last September, the peopleof that island suffered large losses. The Red Cross and the War Departmentwent to their rescue. The property loss is being, retrieved. Sugar,tobacco, citrus fruit, and coffee, all suffered damage. The first three canlargely look after themselves. The coffee growers will need someassistance, which should be extended strictly on a business basis, andonly after most careful investigation. The people of Porto Rico are notasking for charity.DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEIt is desirable that all the legal activities of the Government beconsolidated under the supervision of the Attorney General. In1870 it was felt necessary to create the Department of Justice for thispurpose. During the intervening period, either through legislation creatinglaw officers or departmental action, additional legal positions not underthe supervision of the Attorney General have been provided until there arenow over 900. Such a condition is as harmful to the interest of theGovernment now as it was in 1870, and should be corrected by appropriatelegislation.SPECIAL GOVERNMENT COUNSELIn order to prosecute the oil cases, I suggested and the Congress enacted alaw providing for the appointment of two special counsel. They have pursuedtheir work with signal ability, recovering all the leased lands besidesnearly $30,000,000 in money, and nearly $17,000,000 in other property. Theyfind themselves hampered by a statute, which the Attorney General construesas applying to them, prohibiting their appearing for private clients beforeany department. For this reason, one has been compelled to resign. No goodresult is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel, and asMr. Roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated Irecommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their officeexempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involvingthe Government.PROHIBITIONThe country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment. Those who object toit have the right to advocate its modification or repeal. Meantime, it isbinding upon the National and State Governments and all our inhabitants.The Federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to preventviolations, especially through smuggling, manufacture, and transportation,and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence.It is bound to continue this policy. Under the terms of the Constitution,however, the obligation is equally on the States to exercise the powerwhich they have through the executive, legislative, judicial, and policebranches of their governments in behalf of enforcement. The FederalGovernment is doing and will continue to do all it can in this directionand is entitled to the active cooperation of the States.CONCLUSIONThe country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and ofpeace more permanent than it has ever before experienced. But, havingreached this position, we should not fail to comprehend that it can easilybe lost. It needs more effort for its support than the less exalted placesof the world. We shall not be permitted to take our case, but shallcontinue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil. The actionsof the Government must command the confidence of the country. Without this,our prosperity would be lost. We must extend to other countries the largestmeasure of generosity, moderation, and patience. In addition to dealingjustly, we can well afford to walk humbly.The end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a moreabundant life. Peace and prosperity are not finalities; they are onlymethods. It is too easy under their influence for a nation to becomeselfish and degenerate. This test has come to the United States. Ourcountry has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge itsintellectual, moral, and spiritual life. The issue is in the hands of thepeople. Our faith in man and God is the justification for the belief in ourcontinuing success.
Herbert Hoover
To the Senate and House of Representatives:The Constitution requires that the President "shall, from time to time,give to the Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommendto their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary andexpedient." In complying with that requirement I wish to emphasize thatduring the past year the Nation has continued to grow in strength; ourpeople have advanced in comfort; we have gained in knowledge; the educationof youth has been more widely spread; moral and spiritual forces have beenmaintained; peace has become more assured. The problems with which we areconfronted are the problems of growth and of progress. In their solution wehave to determine the facts, to develop the relative importance to beassigned to such facts, to formulate a common judgment upon them, and torealize solutions in spirit of conciliation.FOREIGN RELATIONSWe are not only at peace with all the world, but the foundations for futurepeace are being substantially strengthened. To promote peace is ourlong established policy. Through the Kellogg Briand pact a great moralstandard has been raised in the world. By it fifty four nations havecovenanted to renounce war and to settle all disputes by pacific means.Through it a new world outlook has been inaugurated which has profoundlyaffected the foreign policies of nations. Since its inauguration we haveinitiated new efforts not only in the organization of the machinery ofpeace but also to eliminate dangerous forces which produce controversiesamongst nations.In January, 1926, the Senate gave its consent to adherence to the Court ofInternational Justice with certain reservations. In September of this yearthe statute establishing the court has, by the action of the nationssignatory, been amended to meet the Senate\'s reservations and to go evenbeyond those reservations to make clear that the court is a trueinternational court of justice. I believe it will be clear to everyone thatno controversy or question in which this country has or claims an interestcan be passed on by the court without our consent at the time the questionarises. The doubt about advisory opinions has been completely safeguarded.Our adherence to the International Court is, as now constituted, not theslightest step toward entry into the League of Nations. As I have beforeindicated, I shall direct that our signature be affixed to the protocol ofadherence and shall submit it for the approval of the Senate with a specialmessage at some time when it is convenient to deal with it.In the hope of reducing friction in the world, and with the desire that wemay reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament, we have joined inconference with Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan to be held inLondon in January to consider the further limitation and reduction of navalarms. We hold high hopes that success may attend this effort.At the beginning of the present administration the neighboring State ofMexico was best with domestic insurrection. We maintained the embargo uponthe shipment of arms to Mexico but permitted the duly constitutedGovernment to procure supplies from our surplus war stocks. Fortunately,the Mexican Government by its own strength successfully withstood theinsurrection with but slight damage. Opportunity of further peacefuldevelopment is given to that country. At the request of the MexicanGovernment, we have since lifted the embargo on shipment of armsaltogether. The two governments have taken further steps to promotefriendly relationships and so solve our differences. Conventions prolongingfor a period of two years the life of the general and special claimscommissions have been concluded.In South America we are proud to have had part in the settlement of thelong standing dispute between Chile and Peru in the disposal of thequestion of Tacna Arica.The work of the commission of inquiry and conciliation between Bolivia andParaguay, in which a representative of this Government participated, hassuccessfully terminated an incident which seemed to threaten war. Theproposed plan for final settlement as suggested by the neutral governmentsis still under consideration.This Government has continued its efforts to act as a mediator in boundarydifficulties between Guatemala and Honduras.A further instance of profound importance in establishing good will was theinauguration of regular air mail service between the United States andCaribbean, Central American, and South American countries.We still have marines on foreign soil in Nicaragua, Haiti, and China. Inthe large sense we do not wish to be represented abroad in such manner.About 1,600 marines remain in Nicaragua at the urgent request of thatgovernment and the leaders of all parties pending the training of adomestic constabulary capable of insuring tranquility. We have alreadyreduced these forces materially and we are anxious to withdraw them furtheras the situation warrants. In Haiti we have about 700 marines, but it is amuch more difficult problem, the solution of which is still obscure. IfCongress approves, I shall dispatch a commission to Haiti to review andstudy the matter in an endeavor to arrive at some more definite policy thanat present. Our forces in China constitute 2,605 men, which we hope alsofurther to reduce to the normal legation guard.It is my desire to establish more firmly our understanding andrelationships with the Latin American countries by strengthening thediplomatic missions to those countries. It is my hope to secure men longexperienced in our Diplomatic Service, who speak the languages of thepeoples to whom they are accredited, as chiefs of our diplomatic missionsin these States. I shall send to the Senate at an early date thenominations of several such men.The Congress has by numerous wise and foresighted acts in the past fewyears greatly strengthened the character of our representation abroad. Ithas made liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarters forour foreign staffs in the different countries. In order, however, that wemay further develop the most effective force in this, one of the mostresponsible functions of our Government, I shall recommend to the Congressmore liberal appropriations for the work of the State Department. I know ofno expenditure of public money from which a greater economic and moralreturn can come to us than by assuring the most effective conduct of ourforeign relations.NATIONAL DEFENSETo preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment is the firstpurpose of government. Our Army and Navy are being maintained in a mostefficient state under officers of high intelligence and zeal. The extentand expansion of their numbers and equipment as at present authorized areample for this purpose.We can well be deeply concerned, however, at the growing expense. From atotal expenditure for national defense purposes in 1914 of $267,000,000, itnaturally rose with the Great War, but receded again to $612,000,000 in1924, when again it began to rise until during the current fiscal year theexpenditures will reach to over $730,000,000, excluding all civilianservices of those departments. Programs now authorized will carry it tostill larger figures in future years. While the remuneration paid to oursoldiers and sailors is justly at a higher rate than that of any othercountry in the world, and while the cost of subsistence is higher, yet thetotal of our expenditures is in excess of those of the most highlymilitarized nations of the world.Upon the conference shortly to be held in London will depend suchmoderation as we can make in naval expenditure. If we shall be compelled toundertake the naval construction implied in the Washington arms treaty aswell as other construction which would appear to be necessary if nointernational agreement can be completed, we shall be committed during thenext six years to a construction expenditure of upward of $1,200,000,000besides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep.After 1914 the various Army contingents necessarily expanded to the end ofthe Great War and then receded to the low point in 1924, when expansionagain began. In 1914 the officers and men in our regular forces, both Armyand Navy, were about 164,000, in 1924 there were about 256,000, and in 1929there were about 250,000. Our citizens\' army, however, including theNational Guard and other forms of reserves, increase these totals up toabout 299,000 in 1914, about 672,000 in 1924, and about 728,000 in 1929.Under the Kellogg pact we have undertaken never to use war as an instrumentof national policy. We have, therefore, undertaken by covenant to use theseequipments solely for defensive purposes. From a defense point of view ourforces should be proportioned to national need and should, therefore, tosome extent be modified by the prospects of peace, which were neverbrighter than to day.It should be borne in mind that the improvement in the National Guard byFederal support begun in 1920 has definitely strengthened our nationalsecurity by rendering them far more effective than ever heretofore. Theadvance of aviation has also greatly increased our effectiveness indefense. In addition to the very large program of air forces which we aremaintaining in the Army and Navy, there has been an enormous growth ofcommercial aviation. This has provided unanticipated reserves inmanufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel, which againadds to our security.I recommend that Congress give earnest consideration to the possibilitiesof prudent action which will give relief from our continuously mountingexpenditures.FINANCES OF THE GOVERNMENTThe finances of the Government are in sound condition. I shall submit thedetailed evidences and the usual recommendations in the special Budgetmessage. I may, however, summarize our position. The public debt on June 30this year stood at $16,931,000,000, compared to the maximum in August,1919, of $26,596,000,000. Since June 30 it has been reduced by a further$238,000,000. In the Budget to be submitted the total appropriationsrecommended for the fiscal year 1931 are $3,830,445,231, as compared to$3,976,141,651 for the present fiscal year. The present fiscal year,however, includes $150,000,000 for the Federal Farm Board, as to which noestimate can as yet be determined for 1931.Owing to the many necessary burdens assumed by Congress in previous yearswhich now require large outlays, it is with extreme difficulty that weshall be able to keep the expenditures for the next fiscal year within thebounds of the present year. Economies in many directions have permittedsome accommodation of pressing needs, the net result being an increase, asshown above, of about one tenth of 1 per cent above the present fiscalyear. We can not fail to recognize the obligations of the Government insupport of the public welfare but we must coincidentally bear in mind theburden of taxes and strive to find relief through some tax reduction. Everydollar so returned fertilizes the soil of prosperity.TAX REDUCTIONThe estimate submitted to me by the Secretary of the Treasury and theBudget Director indicates that the Government will close the fiscal year1930 with a surplus of about $225,000,000 and the fiscal year 1931 with asurplus of about $123,000,000. Owing to unusual circumstances, it has beenextremely difficult to estimate future revenues with accuracy.I believe, however, that the Congress will be fully justified in giving thebenefits of the prospective surpluses to the taxpayers, particularly asample provision for debt reduction has been made in both years through theform of debt retirement from ordinary revenues. In view of the uncertaintyin respect of future revenues and the comparatively small size of theindicated surplus in 1931, relief should take the form of a provisionalrevision of tax rates.I recommend that the normal income tax rates applicable to the incomes ofindividuals for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 5, 3, and 1 1/2;per cent, to 4, 2, and 1/2; per cent, and that the tax on the income ofcorporations for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 12 to 11 per cent.It is estimated that this will result in a reduction of $160,000,000 inincome taxes to be collected during the calendar year 1930. The loss inrevenue will be divided approximately equally between the fiscal years 1930and 1931. Such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximumnumber of taxpayers, with relatively larger benefits to taxpayers withsmall or moderate incomes.FOREIGN DEBTSThe past year has brought us near to completion of settlements of theindebtedness of foreign governments to the United States.The act of Congress approved February 4, 1929, authorized the settlementwith the Government of Austria along lines similar to the terms ofsettlement offered by that Government to its other relief creditors. Noagreement has yet been concluded with that government, but the form ofagreement has been settled and its execution only awaits the Government ofAustria securing the assent by all the other relief creditors of the termsoffered. The act of Congress approved February 14, 1929, authorized thesettlement with the Government of Greece, and an agreement was concluded onMay 10, 1929.The Government of France ratified the agreement with us on July 27, 1929.This agreement will shortly be before the Congress and I recommend itsapproval.The only indebtedness of foreign governments to the United States nowunsettled is that of Russia and Armenia.During the past year a committee of distinguished experts under Americanleadership submitted a plan looking to a revision of claims against Germanyby the various Governments. The United States denied itself anyparticipation in the war settlement of general reparations and our claimsare comparatively small in amount. They arise from costs of the army ofoccupation and claims of our private citizens for losses under awards fromthe Mixed Claims Commission established under agreement with the GermanGovernment. In finding a basis for settlement it was necessary for thecommittee of experts to request all the Governments concerned to make somecontribution to the adjustment and we have felt that we should share aproportion of the concessions made.The State and Treasury Departments will be in a position shortly to submitfor your consideration a draft of an agreement to be executed between theUnited States and Germany providing for the payments of these revisedamounts. A more extensive statement will be submitted at that time.The total amount of indebtedness of the various countries to the UnitedStates now funded is $11,579,465,885. This sum was in effect provided bythe issue of United States Government bonds to our own people. The paymentsof the various Governments to us on account of principal and interest for1930 are estimated at a total of about $239,000,000, for 1931 at about$236,000,000, for 1932 at about $246,000,000. The measure of Americancompromise in these settlements may be appreciated from the fact that ourtaxpayers are called upon to find annually about $475,000,000 in interestand in addition to redeem the principal of sums borrowed by the UnitedStates Government for these purposes.ALIEN ENEMY PROPERTYThe wise determination that this property seized in war should be returnedto its owners has proceeded with considerable rapidity. Of the originalseized cash and property (valued at a total of about $625,000,000), all but$111,566,700 has been returned. Most of the remainder should be disposed ofduring the next year.GENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATIONThe country has enjoyed a large degree of prosperity and sound progressduring the past year with a steady improvement in methods of production anddistribution and consequent advancement in standards of living. Progresshas, of course, been unequal among industries, and some, such as coal,lumber, leather, and textiles, still lag behind. The long upward trend offundamental progress, however, gave rise to over optimism as to profits,which translated itself into a wave of uncontrolled speculation insecurities, resulting in the diversion of capital from business to thestock market and the inevitable crash. The natural consequences have been areduction in the consumption of luxuries and semi necessities by those whohave met with losses, and a number of persons thrown temporarily out ofemployment. Prices of agricultural products dealt in upon the great marketshave been affected in sympathy with the stock crash.Fortunately, the Federal reserve system had taken measures to strengthenthe position against the day when speculation would break, which togetherwith the strong position of the banks has carried the whole credit systemthrough the crisis without impairment. The capital which has been hithertoabsorbed in stock market loans for speculative purposes is now returning tothe normal channels of business. There has been no inflation in the pricesof commodities; there has been no undue accumulation of goods, and foreigntrade has expanded to a magnitude which exerts a steadying influence uponactivity in industry and employment.The sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of theeconomic consequences of previous crashes under a much less securedfinancial system created unwarranted pessimism and fear. It was recalledthat past storms of similar character had resulted in retrenchment ofconstruction, reduction of wages, and laying off of workers. The naturalresult was the tendency of business agencies throughout the country topause in their plans and proposals for continuation and extension of theirbusinesses, and this hesitation unchecked could in itself intensify into adepression with widespread unemployment and suffering.I have, therefore, instituted systematic, voluntary measures of cooperationwith the business institutions and with State and municipal authorities tomake certain that fundamental businesses of the country shall continue asusual, that wages and therefore consuming power shall not be reduced, andthat a special effort shall be made to expand construction work in order toassist in equalizing other deficits in employment. Due to the enlargedsense of cooperation and responsibility which has grown in the businessworld during the past few years the response has been remarkable andsatisfactory. We have canvassed the Federal Government and institutedmeasures of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful, and uponwhich the different departments will make some early recommendations toCongress.I am convinced that through these measures we have reestablishedconfidence. Wages should remain stable. A very large degree of industrialunemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occurred has beenprevented. Agricultural prices have reflected the returning confidence. Themeasures taken must be vigorously pursued until normal conditions arerestored.AGRICULTUREThe agricultural situation is improving. The gross farm income as estimatedby the Department of Agriculture for the crop season 1926 27 was$12,100,000,000; for 1927 28 it was $12,300,000,000; for 1928 29 it was$12,500,000,000; and estimated on the basis of prices since the lastharvest the value of the 1929 30 crop would be over $12,650,000,000. Theslight decline in general commodity prices during the past few yearsnaturally assists the farmers\' buying power.The number of farmer bankruptcies is very materially decreased belowprevious years. The decline in land values now seems to be arrested andrate of movement from the farm to the city has been reduced. Not allsections of agriculture, of course, have fared equally, and some areas havesuffered from drought. Responsible farm leaders have assured me that alarge measure of confidence is returning to agriculture and that a feelingof optimism pervades that industry.The most extensive action for strengthening the agricultural industry evertaken by any government was inaugurated through the farm marketing act ofJune 15 last. Under its provisions the Federal Farm Board has beenestablished, comprised of men long and widely experienced in agricultureand sponsored by the farm organizations of the country. During its shortperiod of existence the board has taken definite steps toward a moreefficient organization of agriculture, toward the elimination of waste inmarketing, and toward the upbuilding of farmers\' marketing organizations onsounder and more efficient lines. Substantial headway has been made in theorganization of four of the basic commodities grain, cotton, livestock,and wool. Support by the board to cooperative marketing organizations andother board activities undoubtedly have served to steady the farmers\'market during the recent crisis and have operated also as a great stimulusto the cooperative organization of agriculture. The problems of theindustry are most complex, and the need for sound organization isimperative. Yet the board is moving rapidly along the lines laid out for itin the act, facilitating the creation by farmers of farmer owned andfarmer controlled organizations and federating them into centralinstitutions, with a view to increasing the bargaining power ofagriculture, preventing and controlling surpluses, and mobilizing theeconomic power of agriculture.THE TARIFFThe special session of Congress was called to expedite the fulfillment ofparty pledges of agricultural relief and the tariff. The pledge of farmrelief has been carried out. At that time I stated the principles uponwhich I believed action should be taken in respect to the tariff: "Aneffective tariff upon agricultural products, that will compensate thefarmer\'s higher costs and higher standards of living, has a dual purpose.Such a tariff not only protects the farmer in our domestic market but italso stimulates him to diversify his crops and to grow products that hecould not otherwise produce, and thus lessens his dependence upon exportsto foreign markets. The great expansion of production abroad under theconditions I have mentioned renders foreign competition in our exportmarkets increasingly serious. It seems but natural, therefore, that theAmerican farmer, having been greatly handicapped in his foreign market bysuch competition from the younger expanding countries, should ask thatforeign access to our domestic market should be regulated by taking intoaccount the differences in our costs of production."In considering the tariff for other industries than agriculture, we findthat there have been economic shifts necessitating a readjustment of someof the tariff schedules. Seven years of experience under the tariff billenacted in 1922 have demonstrated the wisdom of Congress in the enactmentof that measure. On the whole it has worked well. In the main our wageshave been maintained at high levels; our exports and imports have steadilyincreased; with some exceptions our manufacturing industries have beenprosperous. Nevertheless, economic changes have taken place during thattime which have placed certain domestic products at a disadvantage and newindustries have come into being, all of which create the necessity for somelimited changes in the schedules and in the administrative clauses of thelaws as written in 1922."It would seem to me that the test of necessity for revision is, in themain, whether there has been a substantial slackening of activity in anindustry during the past few years, and a consequent decrease of employmentdue to insurmountable competition in the products of that industry. It isnot as if we were setting up a new basis of protective duties. We did thatseven years ago. What we need to remedy now is whatever substantial loss ofemployment may have resulted from shifts since that time."In determining changes in our tariff we must not fail to take into accountthe broad interests of the country as a whole, and such interests includeour trade relations with other countries." No condition has arisen in myview to change these principles stated at the opening of the specialsession. I am firmly of the opinion that their application to the pendingrevision will give the country the kind of a tariff law it both needs andwants. It would be most helpful if action should be taken at an earlymoment, more especially at a time when business and agriculture are bothcooperating to minimize future uncertainties. It is just that they shouldknow what the rates are to be.Even a limited revision requires the consideration and readjustment of manyitems. The exhaustive inquiries and valuable debate from men representativeof all parts of the country which is needed to determine the detailed ratesmust necessarily be accomplished in the Congress. However perfectly thisrate structure may be framed at any given time, the shifting of economicforces which inevitably occurs will render changes in some items desirablebetween the necessarily long intervals of congressional revision.Injustices are bound to develop, such as were experienced by the dairymen,the flaxseed producers, the glass industry, and others, under the 1922rates. For this reason, I have been most anxious that the broad principleof the flexible tariff as provided in the existing law should be preservedand its delays in action avoided by more expeditious methods of determiningthe costs of production at home and abroad, with executive authority topromulgate such changes upon recommendation of the Tariff Commission afterexhaustive investigation. Changes by the Congress in the isolated itemssuch as those to which I have referred would have been most unlikely bothbecause of the concentrations of oppositions in the country, who could seeno advantage to their own industry or State, and because of the difficultyof limiting consideration by the Congress to such isolated cases.There is no fundamental conflict between the interests of the farmer andthe worker. Lowering of the standards of living of either tends to destroythe other. The prosperity of one rests upon the well being of the other.Nor is there any real conflict between the East and the West or the Northand the South in the United States. The complete interlocking of economicdependence, the common striving for social and spiritual progress, ourcommon heritage as Americans, and the infinite web of national sentiment,have created a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all humanhistory. These invisible bonds should not and can not be shattered bydifferences of opinion growing out of discussion of a tariff.PUBLIC BUILDINGSUnder the provisions of various acts of Congress $300,000,000 has beenauthorized for public buildings and the land upon which to construct them,being $75,000,000 for the District of Columbia and $225,000,000 for thecountry at large. Excluding $25,000,000 which is for the acquisition ofland in the so called "triangle" in this city, this public buildinglegislation provides for a five year program for the District of Columbiaand between an eight and nine year program for the country at large. Ofthis sum approximately $27,400,000 was expended up to June 30 last, ofwhich $11,400,000 has been expended in the District and $16,000,000outside.Even this generous provision for both the District of Columbia and thecountry is insufficient For most pressing governmental needs. Expensiverents and inadequate facilities are extravagance and not economy. In theDistrict even after the completion of these projects we shall have fully20,000 clerks housed in rented and temporary war buildings which can lastbut a little longer.I therefore recommend that consideration should be given to the extensionof authorizations both for the country at large and for the District ofColumbia again distributed over a term of years. A survey of the need inboth categories has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury and thePostmaster General. It would be helpful in the present economic situationif such steps were taken as would enable early construction work.An expedition and enlargement of the program in the District would bringabout direct economies in construction by enabling the erection ofbuildings in regular sequence. By maintaining a stable labor force in thecity, contracts can be made on more advantageous terms.The earlier completion of this program which is an acknowledged need wouldadd dignity to the celebration in 1932 of the two hundredth anniversary ofthe birth of President Washington.In consideration of these projects which contribute so much to dignify theNational Capital I should like to renew the suggestion that the Fine ArtsCommission should be required to pass upon private buildings which areproposed for sites facing upon public buildings and parks. Without suchcontrol much of the effort of the Congress in beautification of the Capitalwill be minimized.THE WATERWAYS AND FLOOD CONTROLThe development of inland waterways has received new impulse from thecompletion during this year of the canalization of the Ohio to a uniform9 foot depth. The development of the other segments of the Mississippisystem should be expedited and with this in view I am recommending anincrease in appropriations for rivers and harbors from $50,000,000 to$55,000,000 per annum which, together with about $4,000,000 per annumreleased by completion of the Ohio, should make available after providingfor other river and harbor works a sum of from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000per annum for the Mississippi system and thus bring it to earlycompletion.Conflict of opinion which has arisen over the proposed floodway from theArkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River has led meto withhold construction upon this portion of the Mississippi flood controlplan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any furtherrecommendation to Congress. The other portions of the project are beingvigorously prosecuted and I have recommended an increase in appropriationsfor this from $30,000,000 of the present year to $35,000,000 during thenext fiscal year.Expansion of our intracoastal waterways to effective barge depths is wellwarranted. We are awaiting the action of Canada upon the St. Lawrencewaterway project.HIGHWAYSThere are over 3,000,000 miles of legally established highways in theUnited States, of which about 10 per cent are included in the State highwaysystems, the remainder being county and other local roads. About 626,000miles have been improved with some type of surfacing, comprising some 63per cent of the State highway systems and 16 per cent of the local roads.Of the improved roads about 102,000 miles are hard surfaced, comprisingabout 22 per cent of the State highway systems and about 8 per cent of thelocal roads.While proper planning should materially reduce the listed mileage of publicroads, particularly in the agricultural districts, and turn these roadsback to useful purposes, it is evident that road construction must be along continued program. Progress in improvement is about 50,000 miles ofall types per annum, of which some 12,000 miles are of the more durabletypes. The total expenditures of Federal, State, and local governments lastyear for construction and maintenance assumed the huge total of$1,660,000,000.Federal aid in the construction of the highway systems in conjunction withthe States has proved to be beneficial and stimulating. We must ultimatelygive consideration to the increase of our contribution to these systems,particularly with a view to stimulating the improvement of farm to marketroads.POST OFFICEOur Post Office deficit has now increased to over $80,000,000 a year, ofwhich perhaps $14,000,000 is due to losses on ocean mail and air mailcontracts. The department is making an exhaustive study of the sources ofthe deficit with view to later recommendation to Congress in respect toit.The Post Office quarters are provided in part by the Federal construction,in part by various forms of rent and lease arrangements. The practice hasgrown up in recent years of contracting long term leases under which bothrent and amortization principal cost of buildings is included. I am advisedthat fully 40 per cent could be saved from many such rent and leaseagreements even after allowing interest on the capital required at thenormal Government rate. There are also many objectionable features to someof these practices. The provision of adequate quarters for the Post Officeshould be put on a sound basis.A revision of air mail rates upon a more systematic and permanent footingis necessary. The subject is under study, and if legislation should provenecessary the subject will be presented to the Congress. In the meantime Irecommend that the Congress should consider the desirability of authorizingfurther expansion of the South American services.COMMERCIAL AVIATIONDuring the past year progress in civil aeronautics has been remarkable.This is to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the FederalGovernment through the establishment and maintenance of airways by theDepartment of Commerce and the mail contracts from the Post OfficeDepartment. The Government improved airways now exceed 25,000 miles morethan 14,000 miles of which will be lighted and equipped for night flyingoperations by the close of the current year. Airport construction throughall the States is extremely active. There are now 1,000 commercial andmunicipal airports in operation with an additional 1,200 proposed for earlydevelopment.Through this assistance the Nation is building a sound aviation system,operated by private enterprise. Over 6,400 planes are in commercial use,and 9,400 pilots are licensed by the Government. Our manufacturing capacityhas risen to 7,500 planes per annum. The aviation companies have increasedregular air transportation until it now totals 90,000 miles perday one fourth of which is flown by night. Mail and express services nowconnect our principal cities, and extensive services for passengertransportation have been inaugurated, and others of importance areimminent. American air lines now reach into Canada and Mexico, to Cuba,Porto Rico, Central America, and most of the important countries of SouthAmerica.RAILWAYSAs a whole, the railroads never were in such good physical and financialcondition, and the country has never been so well served by them. Thegreatest volume of freight traffic ever tendered is being carried at aspeed never before attained and with satisfaction to the shippers.Efficiencies and new methods have resulted in reduction in the cost ofproviding freight transportation, and freight rates show a continuousdescending line from the level enforced by the World War.We have, however, not yet assured for the future that adequate system oftransportation through consolidations which was the objective of theCongress in the transportation act. The chief purpose of consolidation isto secure well balanced systems with more uniform and satisfactory ratestructure, a more stable financial structure, more equitable distributionof traffic, greater efficiency, and single line instead of multiple linehauls. In this way the country will have the assurance of better serviceand ultimately at lower and more even rates than would otherwise beattained. Legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation methods andbetter to protect public interest should be enacted.Consideration should also be given to relief of the members of theCommission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparativelyinconsequential matters which, under the existing law, must receive theirdirect and personal consideration. It is in the public interest that themembers of the Commission should not be so pressed by minor matters thatthey have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the largerquestions committed to them for solution. As to many of these minormatters, the function of the Commission might well be made revisory, andthe primary responsibility delegated to subordinate officials after thepractice long in vogue in the executive departments.MERCHANT MARINEUnder the impulse of the merchant marine act of 1928 the transfer toprivate enterprise of the Government owned steamship lines is going forwardwith increasing success. The Shipping Board now operates about 18 lines,which is less than half the number originally established, and the estimateof expenditures for the coming fiscal year is based upon reduction inlosses on Government lines by approximately one half. Construction loanshave been made to the amount of approximately $75,000,000 out of therevolving fund authorized by Congress and have furnished an additional aidto American shipping and further stimulated the building of vessels inAmerican yards.Desirous of securing the full values to the Nation of the great effort todevelop our merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after theinauguration of the present administration, I appointed aninterdepartmental committee, consisting of the Secretary of Commerce, aschairman, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster General, and thechairman of the Shipping Board, to make a survey of the policies beingpursued under the act of 1928 in respect of mail contracts; to inquire intoits workings and to advise the Postmaster General in the administration ofthe act.In particular it seemed to me necessary to determine if the result of thecontracts already let would assure the purpose expressed in the act, "tofurther develop an American merchant marine, to assure its permanence inthe transportation of the foreign trade of the United States, and for otherpurposes," and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purposes maybe translated into actualities.In review of the mail contracts already awarded it was found that theyaggregated 25 separate awards imposing a governmental obligation of alittle over $12,000,000 per annum. Provision had been imposed in five ofthe contracts for construction of new vessels with which to replace andexpand services. These requirements come to a total of 12 vessels in the10 year period, aggregating 122,000 tons. Some other conditions in thecontracts had not worked out satisfactorily.That study has now been substantially completed and the committee hasadvised the desirability and the necessity of securing much largerundertakings as to service and new construction in future contracts. Thecommittee at this time is recommending the advertising of 14 additionalroutes, making substantial requirements for the construction of new vesselsduring the life of each contract recommended. A total of 40 new vesselswill be required under the contracts proposed, about half of which will berequired to be built during the next three years. The capital cost of thisnew construction will be approximately $250,000,000, involvingapproximately 460,000 gross tons. Should bidders be found who will makethese undertakings, it will be necessary to recommend to Congress anincrease in the authorized expenditure by the Post Office of about$5,500,000 annually. It will be most advantageous to grant such anauthority.A conflict as to the administration of the act has arisen in the contentionof persons who have purchased Shipping Board vessels that they are entitledto mail contracts irrespective of whether they are the lowest bidder, thePost Office, on the other hand, being required by law to let contracts inthat manner. It is urgent that Congress should clarify this situation.THE BANKING SYSTEMIt is desirable that Congress should consider the revision of some portionsof the banking law.The development of "group" and "chain" banking presents many new problems.The question naturally arises as to whether if allowed to expand withoutrestraint these methods would dangerously concentrate control of credit,and whether they would not in any event seriously threaten one of thefundamentals of the American credit system which is that credit which isbased upon banking deposits should be controlled by persons within thoseareas which furnish these deposits and thus be subject to the restraints oflocal interest and public opinion in those areas. To some degree, however,this movement of chain or group banking is a groping for stronger supportto the banks and a more secure basis for these institutions.The growth in size and stability of the metropolitan banks is in markedcontrast to the trend in the country districts, with its many failures andthe losses these failures have imposed upon the agricultural community.The relinquishment of charters of national banks in great commercialcenters in favor of State charters indicates that some conditions surroundthe national banks which render them unable to compete with State banks;and their withdrawal results in weakening our national banking system.It has been proposed that permission should be granted to national banks toengage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limitedregions the local responsibility and the control of such creditinstitutions.All these subjects, however, require careful investigation, and it might befound advantageous to create a joint commission embracing Members of theCongress and other appropriate Federal officials for subsequent report.ELECTRICAL POWER REGULATIONThe Federal Power Commission is now comprised of three Cabinet officers,and the duties involved in the competent conduct of the growingresponsibilities of this commission far exceed the time and attention whichthese officials can properly afford from other important duties. Irecommended that authority be given for the appointment of full timecommissioners to replace them.It is also desirable that the authority of the commission should beextended to certain phases of power regulation. The nature of the electricutilities industry is such that about 90 per cent of all power generationand distribution is intrastate in character, and most of the States havedeveloped their own regulatory systems as to certificates of convenience,rates, and profits of such utilities. To encroach upon their authoritiesand responsibilities would be an encroachment upon the rights of theStates. There are cases, however, of interstate character beyond thejurisdiction of the States. To meet these cases it would be most desirableif a method could be worked out by which initial action may be takenbetween the commissions of the States whose joint action should be madeeffective by the Federal Power Commission with a reserve to act on its ownmotion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the States.THE RADIO COMMISSIONI recommend the reorganization of the Radio Commission into a permanentbody from its present temporary status. The requirement of the present lawthat the commissioners shall be appointed from specified zones should beabolished and a general provision made for their equitable selection fromdifferent parts of the country. Despite the effort of the commissioners,the present method develops a public insistence that the commissioners arespecially charged with supervision of radio affairs in the zone from whicheach is appointed. As a result there is danger that the system willdegenerate from a national system into five regional agencies with varyingpractices, varying policies, competitive tendencies, and consequent failureto attain its utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole.MUSCLE SHOALSIt is most desirable that this question should be disposed of. Underpresent conditions the income from these plants is less than couldotherwise be secured for its use, and more especially the public is notsecuring the full benefits which could be obtained from them.It is my belief that such parts of these plants as would be useful and therevenues from the remainder should be dedicated for all time to the farmersof the United States for investigation and experimentation on a commercialscale in agricultural chemistry. By such means advancing discoveries ofscience can be systematically applied to agricultural need, and developmentof the chemical industry of the Tennessee Valley can be assured.I do not favor the operation by the Government of either power ormanufacturing business except as an unavoidable by product of some othermajor public purpose.Any form of settlement of this question will imply entering upon a contractor contracts for the lease of the plants either as a whole or in parts andthe reservation of facilities, products, or income for agriculturalpurposes. The extremely technical and involved nature of such contractsdealing with chemical and electrical enterprises, added to the unusualdifficulties surrounding these special plants, and the rapid commercialchanges now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture, leadme to suggest that Congress create a special commission, not to investigateand report as in the past, but with authority to negotiate and completesome sort of contract or contracts on behalf of the Government, subject, ofcourse, to such general requirements as Congress may stipulate.BOULDER DAMThe Secretary of the Interior is making satisfactory progress innegotiation of the very complex contracts required for the sale of thepower to be generated at this project. These contracts must assure thereturn of all Government outlays upon the project. I recommend that thenecessary funds be appropriated for the initiation of this work as soon asthe contracts are in the hands of Congress.CONSERVATIONConservation of national resources is a fixed policy of the Government.Three important questions bearing upon conservation of the public landshave become urgent.Conservation of our oil and gas resources against future need is a nationalnecessity. The working of the oil permit system in development of oil andgas resources on the public domain has been subject to great abuse. Iconsidered it necessary to suspend the issuance of such permits and todirect the review of all outstanding permits as to compliance of theholders with the law. The purpose was not only to end such abuse but toplace the Government in position to review the entire subject.We are also confronted with a major problem in conservation due to theovergrazing on public lands. The effect of overgrazing (which has nowbecome general) is not only to destroy the ranges but by impairing theground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many parts of theWest through quick run off, spring floods, and autumn drought.We have a third problem of major dimensions in the reconsideration of ourreclamation policy. The inclusion of most of the available lands of thepublic domain in existing or planned reclamation projects largely completesthe original purpose of the Reclamation Service. There still remains thenecessity for extensive storage of water in the arid States which rendersit desirable that we should give a wider vision and purpose to thisservice.To provide for careful consideration of these questions and also of betterdivision of responsibilities in them as between the State and FederalGovernments, including the possible transfer to the States for schoolpurposes of the lands unreserved for forests, parks, power, minerals, etc.,I have appointed a Commission on Conservation of the Public Domain, with amembership representing the major public land States and at the same timethe public at large. I recommend that Congress should authorize a moderatesum to defray their expenses.SOCIAL SERVICEThe Federal Government provides for an extensive and valuable program ofconstructive social service, in education, home building, protection towomen and children, employment, public health, recreation, and many otherdirections.In a broad sense Federal activity in these directions has been confined toresearch and dissemination of information and experience, and at most totemporary subsidies to the States in order to secure uniform advancement inpractice and methods. Any other attitude by the Federal Government willundermine one of the most precious possessions of the American people; thatis, local and individual responsibility. We should adhere to this policy.Federal officials can, however, make a further and most importantcontribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntaryagencies, and by extending Federal assistance in organization of theseforces and bringing about cooperation among them.As an instance of this character, I have recently, in cooperation with theSecretaries of Interior and Labor, laid the foundations of an exhaustiveinquiry into the facts precedent to a nation wide White House conference onchild health and protection. This cooperative movement among interestedagencies will impose no expense upon the Government. Similar nation wideconferences will be called in connection with better housing and recreationat a later date.In view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policies whichshould be pursued by the Federal Government with respect to education, Ihave appointed a committee representative of the important educationalassociations and others to investigate and present recommendations. Incooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, I have also appointed avoluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation widemovement for abolition of illiteracy.I have recommended additional appropriations for the Federal employmentservice in order that it may more fully cover its cooperative work withState and local services. I have also recommended additional appropriationsfor the Women\'s and Children\'s Bureaus for much needed research as to factswhich I feel will prove most helpful.PUBLIC HEALTHThe advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health imposes newconsiderations upon us. The Nation as a whole is vitally interested in thehealth of all the people; in protection from spread of contagious disease;in the relation of physical and mental disabilities to criminality; and inthe economic and moral advancement which is fundamentally associated withsound body and mind. The organization of preventive measures and healtheducation in its personal application is the province of public healthservice. Such organization should be as universal as public education. Itssupport is a proper burden upon the taxpayer. It can not be organized withsuccess, either in its sanitary or educational phases, except under publicauthority. It should be based upon local and State responsibility, but Iconsider that the Federal Government has an obligation of contribution tothe establishment of such agencies.In the practical working out of organization, exhaustive experiment andtrial have demonstrated that the base should be competent organization ofthe municipality, county, or other local unit. Most of our municipalitiesand some 400 rural counties out of 3,000 now have some such unitorganization. Where highly developed, a health unit comprises at least aphysician, sanitary engineer, and community nurse with the addition, insome cases, of another nurse devoted to the problems of maternity andchildren. Such organization gives at once a fundamental control ofpreventive measures and assists in community instruction. The FederalGovernment, through its interest in control of contagion, acting throughthe United States Public Health Service and the State agencies, has in thepast and should in the future concern itself with this development,particularly in the many rural sections which are unfortunately far behindin progress. Some parts of the funds contributed under the Sheppard TownerAct through the Children\'s Bureau of the Department of Labor have alsofound their way into these channels.I recommend to the Congress that the purpose of the Sheppard Towner Actshould be continued through the Children\'s Bureau for a limited period ofyears; and that the Congress should consider the desirability of confiningthe use of Federal funds by the States to the building up of such county orother local units, and that such outlay should be positively coordinatedwith the funds expended through the United States Public Health Servicedirected to other phases of the same county or other local unitorganization. All funds appropriated should of course be applied throughthe States, so that the public health program of the county or local unitwill be efficiently coordinated with that of the whole State.FEDERAL PRISONSClosely related to crime conditions is the administration of the Federalprison system. Our Federal penal institutions are overcrowded, and thiscondition is daily becoming worse. The parole and probation systems areinadequate. These conditions make it impossible to perform the work ofpersonal reconstruction of prisoners so as to prepare them for return tothe duties of citizenship. In order to relieve the pressing evils I havedirected the temporary transfer of the Army Disciplinary Barracks atLeavenworth to the Department of Justice for use as a Federal prison. Notonly is this temporary but it is inadequate for present needs.We need some new Federal prisons and a reorganization of our probation andparole systems; and there should be established in the Department ofJustice a Bureau of Prisons with a sufficient force to deal adequately withthe growing activities of our prison institutions. Authorization for theimprovements should be given speedily, with initial appropriations to allowthe construction of the new institutions to be undertaken at once.IMMIGRATIONRestriction of immigration has from every aspect proved a sound nationalpolicy. Our pressing problem is to formulate a method by which the limitednumber of immigrants whom we do welcome shall be adapted to our nationalsetting and our national needs.I have been opposed to the basis of the quotas now in force and I havehoped that we could find some practical method to secure what I believeshould be our real national objective; that is, fitness of the immigrant asto physique, character, training, and our need of service. Perhaps somesystem of priorities within the quotas could produce these results and atthe same time enable some hardships in the present system to be cleared up.I recommend that the Congress should give the subject further study, inwhich the executive departments will gladly cooperate with the hope ofdiscovering such method as will more fully secure our national necessities.VETERANSIt has been the policy of our Government almost from its inception to makeprovision for the men who have been disabled in defense of our country.This policy should be maintained. Originally it took the form of landgrants and pensions. This system continued until our entry into the WorldWar. The Congress at that time inaugurated a new plan of compensation,rehabilitation, hospitalization, medical care and treatment, and insurance,whereby benefits were awarded to those veterans and their immediatedependents whose disabilities were attributable to their war service. Thebasic principle in this legislation is sound.In a desire to eliminate all possibilities of injustice due to difficultiesin establishing service connection of disabilities, these principles havebeen to some degree extended. Veterans whose diseases or injuries havebecome apparent within a brief period after the war are now receivingcompensation; insurance benefits have been liberalized. Emergency officersare now receiving additional benefits. The doors of the Government\'shospitals have been opened to all veterans, even though their diseases orinjuries were not the result of their war service. In addition adjustedservice certificates have been issued to 3,433,300 veterans. This in itselfwill mean an expenditure of nearly $3,500,000,000 before 1945, in additionto the $600,000,000 which we are now appropriating annually for ourveterans\' relief.The administration of all laws concerning the veterans and their dependentshas been upon the basis of dealing generously, humanely, and justly. Whilesome inequalities have arisen, substantial and adequate care has been givenand justice administered. Further improvement in administration may requiresome amendment from time to time to the law, but care should be taken tosee that such changes conform to the basic principles of the legislation.I am convinced that we will gain in efficiency, economy, and more uniformadministration and better definition of national policies if the PensionBureau, the National Home for Volunteer Soldiers, and the Veterans\' Bureauare brought together under a single agency. The total appropriations tothese agencies now exceed $800,000,000 per annum.CIVIL SERVICEApproximately four fifths of all the employees in the executive civilservice now occupy positions subject to competitive examination under thecivil service law.There are, however, still commanding opportunities for extending thesystem. These opportunities lie within the province of Congress and not thePresident. I recommend that a further step be taken by authorization thatappointments of third class postmasters be made under the civil servicelaw.DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATIONThis subject has been under consideration for over 20 years. It waspromised by both political parties in the recent campaign. It has beenrepeatedly examined by committees and commissions congressional,executive, and voluntary. The conclusions of these investigations have beenunanimous that reorganization is a necessity of sound administration; ofeconomy; of more effective governmental policies and of relief to thecitizen from unnecessary harassment in his relations with a multitude ofscattered governmental agencies. But the presentation of any specific planat once enlivens opposition from every official whose authority may becurtailed or who fears his position is imperiled by such a result; ofbureaus and departments which wish to maintain their authority andactivities; of citizens and their organizations who are selfishlyinterested, or who are inspired by fear that their favorite bureau may, ina new setting, be less subject to their influence or more subject to someother influence.It seems to me that the essential principles of reorganization are two innumber. First, all administrative activities of the same major purposeshould be placed in groups under single headed responsibility; second, allexecutive and administrative functions should be separated from boards andcommissions and placed under individual responsibility, whilequasi legislative and quasi judicial and broadly advisory functions shouldbe removed from individual authority and assigned to boards andcommissions. Indeed, these are the fundamental principles upon which ourGovernment was founded, and they are the principles which have been adheredto in the whole development of our business structure, and they are thedistillation of the common sense of generations.For instance, the conservation of national resources is spread among eightagencies in five departments. They suffer from conflict and overlap. Thereis no proper development and adherence to broad national policies and nocentral point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrateitself. These functions should be grouped under the direction of some suchofficial as an assistant secretary of conservation. The particulardepartment or cabinet officer under which such a group should be placed isof secondary importance to the need of concentration. The same may be saidof educational services, of merchant marine aids, of public works, ofpublic health, of veterans\' services, and many others, the component partsof which are widely scattered in the various departments and independentagencies. It is desirable that we first have experience with thesedifferent groups in action before we create new departments. These may benecessary later on.With this background of all previous experience I can see no hope for thedevelopment of a sound reorganization of the Government unless Congress bewilling to delegate its authority over the problem (subject to definedprinciples) to the Executive, who should act upon approval of a jointcommittee of Congress or with the reservation of power of revision byCongress within some limited period adequate for its consideration.PROHIBITIONThe first duty of the President under his oath of office is to secure theenforcement of the laws. The enforcement of the laws enacted to give effectto the eighteenth amendment is far from satisfactory and this is in partdue to the inadequate organization of the administrative agencies of theFederal Government. With the hope of expediting such reorganization, Irequested on June 6 last that Congress should appoint a joint committee tocollaborate with executive agencies in preparation of legislation. It wouldbe helpful if it could be so appointed. The subject has been earnestlyconsidered by the Law Enforcement Commission and the administrativeofficials of the Government. Our joint conclusions are that certain stepsshould be taken at once. First, there should be an immediate concentrationof responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agencies of the FederalGovernment by transfer to the Department of Justice of the Federalfunctions of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution, whichare now lodged in the Prohibition Bureau in the Treasury; and at the sametime the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalizedbeverages should remain in the Treasury. Second, provision should be madefor relief of congestion in the Federal courts by modifying and simplifyingthe procedure for dealing with the large volume of petty prosecutions undervarious Federal acts. Third, there should be a codification of the lawsrelating to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exists ofresorting to more than 25 statutes enacted at various times over 40 years.Technical defects in these statutes that have been disclosed should becured. I would add to these recommendations the desirability ofreorganizing the various services engaged in the prevention of smugglinginto one border patrol under the Coast Guard. Further recommendations uponthe subject as a whole will be developed after further examination by theLaw Enforcement Commission, but it is not to be expected that any criminallaw will ever be fully enforced so long as criminals exist.The District of Columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in theNation. While conditions here are much better than in many other cities,they are far from perfect, and this is due in part to the congestion ofcriminal cases in the Supreme Court of the District, resulting in longdelays. Furthermore, there is need for legislation in the Districtsupplementing the national prohibition act, more sharply defining andenlarging the duties and powers of the District Commissioners and thepolice of the District, and opening the way for better cooperation in theenforcement of prohibition between the District officials and theprohibition officers of the Federal Government. It is urgent that theseconditions be remedied.LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OBSERVANCENo one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kindsand the growth of organized crime in our country. We have pressing need soto organize our system of administering criminal justice as to establishfull vigor and effectiveness. We need to reestablish faith that the highestinterests of our country are served by insistence upon the swift andeven handed administration of justice to all offenders, whether they berich or poor. That we shall effect improvement is vital to the preservationof our institutions. It is the most serious issue before our people.Under the authority of Congress I have appointed a National Commission onLaw Observance and Enforcement, for an exhaustive study of the entireproblem of the enforcement of our laws and the improvement of our judicialsystem, including the special problems and abuses growing out of theprohibition laws. The commission has been invited to make the widestinquiry into the shortcomings of the administration of justice and into thecauses and remedies for them. It has organized its work under subcommitteesdealing with the many contributory causes of our situation and has enlistedthe aid of investigators in fields requiring special consideration. I amconfident that as a result of its studies now being carried forward it willmake a notable contribution to the solution of our pressing problems.Pending further legislation, the Department of Justice has been striving toweed out inefficiency wherever it exists, to stimulate activity on the partof its prosecuting officers, and to use increasing care in examining intothe qualifications of those appointed to serve as prosecutors. Thedepartment is seeking systematically to strengthen the law enforcementagencies week by week and month by month, not by dramatic displays but bysteady pressure; by removal of negligent officials and by encouragement andassistance to the vigilant. During the course of these efforts it has beenrevealed that in some districts causes contributing to the congestion ofcriminal dockets, and to delays and inefficiency in prosecutions, have beenlack of sufficient forces in the offices of United States attorneys, clerksof courts, and marshals. These conditions tend to clog the machinery ofjustice. The last conference of senior circuit judges has taken note ofthem and indorsed the department\'s proposals for improvement. Increases inappropriations are necessary and will be asked for in order to reenforcethese offices.The orderly administration of the law involves more than the mere machineryof law enforcement. The efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in ourpeople in support of law are alike essential. We have need for improvementin both. However much we may perfect the mechanism, still if the citizenwho is himself dependent upon some laws for the protection of all that hehas and all that he holds dear, shall insist on selecting the particularlaws which he will obey, he undermines his own safety and that of hiscountry. His attitude may obscure, but it can not conceal, the ugly truththat the lawbreaker, whoever he may be, is the enemy of society. We can nolonger gloss over the unpleasant reality which should be made vital in theconsciousness of every citizen, that he who condones or traffics withcrime, who is indifferent to it and to the punishment of the criminal, orto the lax performance of official duty, is himself the most effectiveagency for the breakdown of society.Law can not rise above its source in good citizenship in what right mindedmen most earnestly believe and desire. If the law is upheld only byGovernment officials, then all law is at an end. Our laws are made by thepeople themselves; theirs is the right to work for their repeal; but untilrepeal it is an equal duty to observe them and demand their enforcement.I have been gratified at the awakening sense of this responsibility in ourcitizens during the past few months, and gratified that many instances haveoccurred which refuted the cynicism which has asserted that our systemcould not convict those who had defied the law and possessed the means toresist its execution. These things reveal a moral awakening both in thepeople and in officials which lies at the very foundation of the rule oflaw.CONCLUSIONThe test of the rightfulness of our decisions must be whether we havesustained and advanced the ideals of the American people; self governmentin its foundations of local government; justice whether to the individualor to the group; ordered liberty; freedom from domination; open opportunityand equality of opportunity; the initiative and individuality of ourpeople; prosperity and the lessening of poverty; freedom of public opinion;education; advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious spirit; thetolerance of all faiths; the foundations of the home and the advancement ofpeace.The White House,December 3, 1929
Herbert Hoover
To the Senate and House of Representatives:I have the honor to comply with the requirement of the Constitution that Ishould lay before the Congress information as to the state of the Union,and recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary andexpedient.Substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace andsecurity; the fundamental strength of the Nation\'s economic life isunimpaired; education and scientific discovery have made advances; ourcountry is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare.ECONOMIC SITUATIONDuring the past 12 months we have suffered with other Nations from economicdepression.The origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own bordersthrough a speculative period which diverted capital and energy intospeculation rather than constructive enterprise. Had overspeculation insecurities been the only force operating, we should have seen recovery manymonths ago, as these particular dislocations have generally readjustedthemselves.Other deep seated causes have been in action, however, chiefly theworld wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times forsuch important basic commodities as wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, copper,silver, zinc, to some extent cotton, and other raw materials. Thecumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these importantcommodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumptionhave produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished thebuying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree whichextended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in allthe industrial nations. The political agitation in Asia; revolutions inSouth America and political unrest in some European States; the methods ofsale by Russia of her increasing agricultural exports to European markets;and our own drought have all contributed to prolong and deepen thedepression.In the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside ofthe United States, and our recuperation has been retarded by theunwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outsideforces.The extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximatepercentages of activity during the past three months as compared with thehighly prosperous year of 1928:Value of department store sales   93% of 1928Volume of manufacturing production   80% of 1928Volume of mineral production   90% of 1928Volume of factory employment   84% of 1928Total of bank deposits   105% of 1928Wholesale prices all commodities   83% of 1928Cost of living   94% of 1928Various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from15 to 20 per cent.There are many factors which give encouragement for the future. The factthat we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities andincomes; that our major financial and industrial institutions have comethrough the storm unimpaired; that price levels of major commodities haveremained approximately stable for some time; that a number of industriesare showing signs of increasing demand; that the world at large isreadjusting itself to the situation; all reflect grounds for confidence. Weshould remember that these occasions have been met many times before, thatthey are but temporary, that our country is to day stronger and richer inresources, in equipment, in skill, than ever in its history. We are in anextraordinary degree self sustaining, we will overcome world influences andwill lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto.Economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executivepronouncement. Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells ofthe economic body the producers and consumers themselves. Recovery can beexpedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action. That cooperationrequires that every individual should sustain faith and courage; that eachshould maintain his self reliance; that each and every one should searchfor methods of improving his business or service; that the vast majoritywhose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursuetheir normal living and recreations; that each should seek to assist hisneighbors who may be less fortunate; that each industry should assist itsown employees; that each community and each State should assume its fullresponsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress withthat sturdiness and independence which built a great Nation.Our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree. The bestcontribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntarycooperation in the community. The Government, National, State, and local,can join with the community in such programs and do its part. A year ago I,together with other officers of the Government, initiated extensivecooperative measures throughout the country.The first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers tomaintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influenceagainst strife. In a large sense these undertakings have been adhered toand we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have alwaysheretofore marked depressions. The index of union wage scales shows them tobe today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years. Inconsequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than wouldotherwise have been the case. Of equal importance the Nation has hadunusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which hascharacterized previous depressions.The second direction of cooperation has been that our governments,National, State, and local, the industries and business so distributeemployment as to give work to the maximum number of employees.The third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extendconstruction work and betterments in anticipation of the future. It hasbeen the universal experience in previous depressions that public works andprivate construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide ofdepression. On this occasion, however, the increased authorization andgenerous appropriations by the Congress and the action of States andmunicipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to anamount even above that in the most prosperous years. In addition thecooperation of public utilities, railways, and other large organizationshas been generously given in construction and betterment work inanticipation of future need. The Department of Commerce advises me that asa result, the volume of this type of construction work, which amounted toroughly $6,300,000,000 in 1929, instead of decreasing will show a total ofabout $7,000,000,000 for 1930. There has, of course, been a substantialdecrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken inadvance of need.The fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such States andmunicipalities, as was deemed necessary, of committees to organize localemployment, to provide for employment agencies, and to effect relief ofdistress.The result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been thatactual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months, andour unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other largeindustrial countries. Some time ago it became evident that unemploymentwould continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to fromseasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largelydepleted. We have as a Nation a definite duty to see that no deservingperson in our country suffers from hunger or cold. I therefore set up amore extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperationthroughout the country. There has been a most gratifying degree ofresponse, from governors, mayors, and other public officials, from welfareorganizations, and from employers in concerns both large and small. Thelocal communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty ofrelieving individual distress and are being generously supported by thepublic.The number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work wasaccurately determined by the census last April as about 2,500,000. TheDepartment of Labor index of employment in the larger trades shows somedecrease in employment since that time. The problem from a relief point ofview is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number ofunemployed would indicate. The intensive community and individual effortsin providing special employment outside the listed industries are notreflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such publishedfigures. Moreover, there is estimated to be a constant figure at all timesof nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual income buttemporarily idle in the shift from one job to another. We have an averageof about three breadwinners to each two families, so that every personunemployed does not represent a family without income. The view that therelief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmedby the experience of several cities, which shows that the number offamilies in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of thecalculated unemployed. This is not said to minimize the very real problemwhich exists but to weigh its actual proportions.As a contribution to the situation the Federal Government is engaged uponthe greatest program of waterway, harbor, flood control, public building,highway, and airway improvement in all our history. This, together withloans to merchant shipbuilders, improvement of the Navy and in militaryaviation, and other construction work of the Government will exceed$520,000,000 for this fiscal year. This compares with $253,000,000 in thefiscal year 1928. The construction works already authorized and thecontinuation of policies in Government aid will require a continualexpenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually.I favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid tounemployment during this winter. The Congress will, however, have presentedto it numbers of projects, some of them under the guise of, rather than thereality of, their usefulness in the increase of employment during thedepression. There are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansionsof construction work. The Government must not undertake works that are notof sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searchingtechnical investigation, and which have not been given adequateconsideration by the Congress. The volume of construction work in theGovernment is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudenceas a continuing policy. To increase taxation for purposes of constructionwork defeats its own purpose, as such taxes directly diminish employment inprivate industry. Again any kind of construction requires, after itsauthorization, a considerable time before labor can be employed in which tomake engineering, architectural, and legal preparations. Our immediateproblem is the increase of employment for the next six months, and newplans which do not produce such immediate result or which extendcommitments beyond this period are not warranted.The enlarged rivers and harbors, public building, and highway plansauthorized by the Congress last session, however, offer an opportunity forassistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programseven faster than originally planned, especially if the technicalrequirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in suchfashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts.With view, however, to the possible need for acceleration, we, immediatelyupon receiving those authorities from the Congress five months ago, beganthe necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality.I have canvassed the departments of the Government as to the maximum amountthat can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate allconstruction during the next six months, and I feel warranted in asking theCongress for an appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 toprovide such further employment in this emergency. In connection therewithwe need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances ofFederal highway aid to the States.I recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the differentdepartments upon recommendation of a committee of the Cabinet and approvalby the President. Its application to works already authorized by theCongress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to publicwelfare. Such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of allkinds of over $650,000,000 during the next twelve months.AGRICULTUREThe world wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all otherindustries. The average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 percent of the levels of 1928. This average is, however, greatly affected bywheat and cotton, which have participated in world wide overproduction andhave fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928.Excluding these commodities, the prices of all other agricultural productsare about 84 per cent of those of 1928. The average wholesale prices ofother primary goods, such as nonferrous metals, have fallen to 76 per centof 1928.The price levels of our major agricultural commodities are, in fact, higherthan those in other principal producing countries, due to the combinedresult of the tariff and the operations of the Farm Board. For instance,wheat prices at Minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at Winnipeg,and at Chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at Buenos Aires. Cornprices at Chicago are over twice as high as at Buenos Aires. Wool pricesaverage more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad, andbutter is 30 per cent higher in New York City than in Copenhagen.Aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world wide depression wehave had the most severe drought. It has affected particularly the Statesbordering on the Potomac, Ohio, and Lower Mississippi Rivers, with someareas in Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. It has found its majorexpression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn cropfrom an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000bushels.On August 14 I called a conference of the governors of the most acutelyaffected States, and as a result of its conclusions I appointed a nationalcommittee comprising the heads of the important Federal agencies under thechairmanship of the Secretary of Agriculture. The governors in turn haveappointed State committees representative of the farmers, bankers, businessmen, and the Red Cross, and subsidiary committees have been established inmost of the acutely affected counties. Railway rates were reduced on feedand livestock in and out of the drought areas, and over 50,000 cars of suchproducts have been transported under these reduced rates. The Red Crossestablished a preliminary fund of $5,000,000 for distress relief purposesand established agencies for its administration in each county. Of thisfund less than $500,000 has been called for up to this time as the needwill appear more largely during the winter. The Federal Farm Loan Board hasextended its credit facilities, and the Federal Farm Board has givenfinancial assistance to all affected cooperatives.In order that the Government may meet its full obligation toward ourcountrymen in distress through no fault of their own, I recommend that anappropriation should be made to the Department of Agriculture to be loanedfor the purpose of seed and feed for animals. Its application should ashitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual,and secured upon the crop.The Red Cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by thesympathetic assistance of our people.FINANCES OF THE GOVERNMENTI shall submit the detailed financial position of the Government withrecommendations in the usual Budget message. I will at this time, however,mention that the Budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for thecurrent year were formulated by the Treasury and the Budget Bureau at atime when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the businessdepression and have been most seriously affected by it. At that time asurplus of about $123,000,000 was estimated for this fiscal year and taxreduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of $75,000,000 wasauthorized by the Congress, thus reducing the estimated surplus to about$48,000,000. Closely revised estimates now made by the Treasury and theBureau of the Budget of the tax, postal, and other receipts for the currentfiscal year indicate a decrease of about $430,000,000 from the estimate ofa year ago, of which about $75,000,000 is due to tax reduction, leavingabout $355,000,000 due to the depression. Moreover, legislation enacted byCongress subsequent to the submission of the Budget enlarging Federalconstruction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans\'services and other items, have increased expenditures during the currentfiscal year by about $225,000,000.Thus the decrease of $430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of$225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original Budget situationby about $655,000,000. This large sum is offset by the original estimatedsurplus a year ago of about $123,000,000, by the application of$185,000,000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to currentexpenditures, by arrangements of the Farm Board through repayments, etc.,in consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon theTreasury by $100,000,000 in this period, and by about $67,000,000 economiesand deferments brought about in the Government, thus reducing the practicaleffect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about$180,000,000 for the present fiscal year. I shall make suggestions forhandling the present year deficit in the Budget message, but I do not favorencroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt.While it will be necessary in public interest to further increaseexpenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment byspeeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by thedrought, I can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to deferany other plans for increase of Government expenditures. The Budget for1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about $4,054,000,000,including postal deficit. The receipts are estimated at about$4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued,leaving a surplus of only about $30,000,000. Most rigid economy istherefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes.NATIONAL DEFENSEOur Army and Navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency, underofficers of high training and intelligence, supported by a devotedpersonnel of the rank and file. The London naval treaty has broughtimportant economies in the conduct of the Navy. The Navy Department willlay before the committees of the Congress recommendations for a program ofauthorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscalyear of 1932.LEGISLATIONThis is the last session of the Seventy first Congress. During its previoussittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation,notably: The establishment of the Federal Farm Board; fixing congressionalreapportionment; revision of the tariff, including the flexible provisionsand a reorganization of the Tariff Commission; reorganization of the RadioCommission; reorganization of the Federal Power Commission; expansion ofFederal prisons; reorganization of parole and probation system in Federalprisons; expansion of veterans\' hospitals; establishment of disabilityallowances to veterans; consolidation of veteran activities; consolidationand strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the Departmentof Justice; organization of a Narcotics Bureau; large expansion of riversand harbors improvements; substantial increase in Federal highways;enlargement of public buildings construction program; and the ratificationof the London naval treaty.The Congress has before it legislation partially completed in the lastsitting in respect to Muscle Shoals, bus regulation, relief of congestionin the courts, reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling,law enforcement in the District of Columbia, and other subjects.It is desirable that these measures should be completed.The short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs, butthere are a number of questions which, if time does not permit action, Irecommend should be placed in consideration by the Congress, perhapsthrough committees cooperating in some instances with the Federaldepartments, with view to preparation for subsequent action. Among them arethe following subjects:ELECTRICAL POWERI have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstateelectrical power. Such regulation should preserve the independence andresponsibility of the States.RAILWAYSWe have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railwaysas a necessity of more stable and more economically operatedtransportation. Further legislation is necessary to facilitate suchconsolidation. In the public interest we should strengthen the railwaysthat they may meet our future needs.ANTITRUST LAWSI recommend that the Congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of theeconomic working of these laws. I do not favor repeal of the Sherman Act.The prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance.Competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is theincentive to progress. However, the interpretation of these laws by thecourts, the changes in business, especially in the economic effects uponthose enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources ofthe country, make such an inquiry advisable. The producers of thesematerials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful anddestructive use of these natural resources together with a destructivecompetition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remediedbecause of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws. Thewell known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration.The people have a vital interest in the conservation of their naturalresources; in the prevention of wasteful practices; in conditions ofdestructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wageearner; and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequatecompetition. I therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially tothe effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fieldsto determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of thefundamental purpose of these laws.CAPITAL GAINS TAXIt is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effectof the income tax on so called capital gains at the present rate is toenhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery. Ibelieve this to be the case and I recommend that a study be made of theeconomic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structureof our income tax law.IMMIGRATIONThere is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited andmore selective basis, flexible to the needs of the country.Under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons comingto the United States seeking work would likely become either a direct orindirect public charge. As a temporary measure the officers issuing visasto immigrants have been, in pursuance of the law, instructed to refusevisas to applicants likely to fall into this class. As a result the visasissued have decreased from an average of about 24,000 per month prior torestrictions to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month. These arelargely preferred persons under the law. Visas from Mexico are about 250per month compared to about 4,000 previous to restrictions. The wholesubject requires exhaustive reconsideration.DEPORTATION OF ALIEN CRIMINALSI urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully ridourselves of criminal aliens. Furthermore, thousands of persons haveentered the country in violation of the immigration laws. The very methodof their entry indicates their objectionable character, and our law abidingforeign born residents suffer in consequence. I recommend that the Congressprovide methods of strengthening the Government to correct this abuse.POST OFFICEDue to deferment of Government building over many years, previousadministrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases forsecondary facilities in large cities, some of which were objectionable asrepresenting too high a return upon the value of the property. To preventthe occasion for further uneconomic leasing I recommend that the Congressauthorize the building by the Government of its own facilities.VETERANSThe Nation has generously expanded its care for veterans. The consolidationof all veterans\' activities into the Veterans\' Administration has producedsubstantial administrative economies. The consolidation also bringsemphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances. The whole subjectis under study by the administrator, and I recommend it should also beexamined by the committees of the Congress.SOCIAL SERVICEI urge further consideration by the Congress of the recommendations I madea year ago looking to the development through temporary Federal aid ofadequate State and local services for the health of children and thefurther stamping out of communicable disease, particularly in the ruralsections. The advance of scientific discovery, methods, and social thoughtimposes a new vision in these matters. The drain upon the Federal Treasuryis comparatively small. The results both economic and moral are of theutmost importance.GENERALIt is my belief that after the passing of this depression, when we canexamine it in retrospect, we shall need to consider a number of otherquestions as to what action may be taken by the Government to removePossible governmental influences which make for instability and to betterorganize mitigation of the effect of depression. It is as yet too soon toconstructively formulate such measures.There are many administrative subjects, such as departmentalreorganization, extension of the civil service, readjustment of the postalrates, etc., which at some appropriate time require the attention of theCongress.FOREIGN RELATIONSOur relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basisof cordiality and good will.During the past year the London naval pact was completed, approved by theSenate, and ratified by the governments concerned. By this treaty we haveabolished competition in the building of warships, have established thebasis of parity of the United States with the strongest of foreign powers,and have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels.During the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world.Asia continues in disturbed condition, and revolutions have taken place inBrazil, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. Despite the jeopardy to our citizensand their property which naturally arises in such circumstances, we have,with the cooperation of the governments concerned, been able to meet allsuch instances without friction.We have resumed normal relations with the new Governments of Brazil,Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were ableto give protection to our citizens and their property, and that theyrecognized their international obligations.A commission which was supported by the Congress has completed itsinvestigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to Haiti andproved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies. Anelection has been held and a new government established. We have replacedour high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawalof our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of thepresent treaty in 1935.A number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed ornegotiated during the year, and will be presented for approval by theSenate.I shall, in a special message, lay before the Senate the protocols coveringthe statutes of the World Court which have been revised to accord with thesense of previous Senate reservations.The White House,December 2, 1930
Herbert Hoover
To the Senate and House of Representatives:It is my duty under the Constitution to transmit to the Congressinformation on the state of the Union and to recommend for itsconsideration necessary and expedient measures.The chief influence affecting the state of the Union during the past yearhas been the continued world wide economic disturbance. Our nationalconcern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to laythe foundations for recovery.If we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we findfundamental national gains even amid depression. In meeting the problems ofthis difficult period, we have witnessed a remarkable development of thesense of cooperation in the community. For the first time in the history ofour major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of publicdisorders and industrial conflict. Above all there is an enlargement ofsocial and spiritual responsibility among the people. The strains andstresses upon business have resulted in closer application, in sanerpolicies, and in better methods. Public improvements have been carried outon a larger scale than even in normal times. The country is richer inphysical property, in newly discovered resources, and in productivecapacity than ever before. There has been constant gain in knowledge andeducation; there has been continuous advance in science and invention;there has been distinct gain in public health. Business depressions havebeen recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory. TheNation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virilitybecause of the enlightenment they have brought, the readjustments and thelarger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and workwhich come from them.NATIONAL DEFENSEBoth our Army and Navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency.The ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highesttraditions of the service. Reductions and postponements in expenditure ofthese departments to meet the present emergency are being made withoutreducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of eitherestablishment.The agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of navalarmaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus eliminationof competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion ofthe deficient categories in our Navy to the parities provided in thosetreaties. However, none of the other nations, parties to these agreements,is to day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty sizeof fleets would imply.Although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which itwas at that time possible to attain, I am hopeful that the naval powers,party to these agreements, will realize that establishment of relativestrength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injuryto any of them. This would be the more possible if pending negotiations aresuccessful between France and Italy. If the world is to regain itsstandards of life, it must further decrease both naval and other arms. Thesubject will come before the General Disarmament Conference which meets inGeneva on February 2.FOREIGN AFFAIRSWe are at peace with the world. We have cooperated with other nations topreserve peace. The rights of our citizens abroad have been protected.The economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of theworld during the past year. In many countries political instability,excessive armaments, debts, governmental expenditures, and taxes haveresulted in revolutions, in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse andfinancial panics, in dumping of goods upon world markets, and in diminishedconsumption of commodities.Within two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in19 countries, embracing more than half the population of the world. Tencountries have been unable to meet their external obligations. In 14countries, embracing a quarter of the world\'s population, former monetarystandards have been temporarily abandoned. In a number of countries therehave been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking.These disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the World War.Every one of them has reacted upon us. They have sharply affected themarkets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products. They haveincreased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and creditsystem.As our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in largedegree from these sources, any effort to bring about our own recuperationhas dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations inreasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability.Cooperation of our Federal reserve system and our banks with the centralbanks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate anumber of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us andthus avert disasters which would have affected us.The economic crisis in Germany and Central Europe last June rose to thedimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that withoutassistance these nations must collapse. Apprehensions of such collapse haddemoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened othernations as to impose further dangers upon us. But of highest importance wasthe necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of Germanyfrom imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations toprogress and stability in the world. Upon the initiative of this Governmenta year\'s postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts wasbrought about. Upon our further initiative an agreement was made byGermany\'s private creditors providing for an extension of such creditsuntil the German people can develop more permanent and definite forms ofrelief.We have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from Haiti andNicaragua.The difficulties between China and Japan have given us great concern, notalone for the maintenance of the spirit of the Kellogg Briand Pact, but forthe maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring theterritorial integrity of China. It is our purpose to assist in findingsolutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties.I shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a latermessage.THE DOMESTIC SITUATIONMany undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year tomeet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us.Broadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress,and to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in ourfinancial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industryand commerce, thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs,inventories, and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy. Thesemeasures have served those purposes and will promote recovery.In these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate privateinitiative and local and community responsibility. There has been the leastpossible Government entry into the economic field, and that only intemporary and emergency form. Our citizens and our local governments havegiven a magnificent display of unity and action, initiative and patriotismin solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the FederalGovernment.For a proper understanding of my recommendations to the Congress it isdesirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year.The emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions.The appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great Federalconstruction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employmentupon a large scale. By organized unity of action, the States andmunicipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement.Many industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensifyconstruction. Industrial concerns and other employers have been organizedto spread available work amongst all their employees, instead ofdischarging a portion of them. A large majority have maintained wages at ashigh levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit. This coursehas saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterizedall previous depressions. Immigration has been curtailed by administrativeaction. Upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to ourunemployment. The expansion of Federal employment agencies underappropriations by the Congress has proved most effective. Through thePresident\'s organization for unemployment relief, public and privateagencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment andother measures against distress. Similar organization gives assuranceagainst suffering during the coming winter. Committees of leading citizensare now active at practically every point of unemployment. In the largemajority they have been assured the funds necessary which, together withlocal government aids, will meet the situation. A few exceptionallocalities will be further organized. The evidence of the Public HealthService shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and generalmortality below normal years. No greater proof could be adduced that ourpeople have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense ofsocial responsibility in the Nation has responded to the need of theunfortunate.To meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by Congress forrehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produceabundant crops in those districts. The Red Cross undertook andmagnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers lastwinter. It has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000sufferers in the new drought area of certain Northwest States. The actionof the Federal Farm Board in granting credits to farm cooperatives savedmany of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength. Byenabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm productsin 1930 and 1931 the Board secured higher prices to the farmer than wouldhave been obtained otherwise, although the benefits of this action werepartially defeated by continued world overproduction. Incident to thisaction the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks wasaverted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster. Thebanks in the South have cooperated with the Farm Board in creation of apool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton. Growers have beenmaterially assisted by this action. Constant effort has been made to reduceoverproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buyingof agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad.To meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from thereaction to acute crisis abroad the National Credit Association was set upby the banks with resources of $500,000,000 to support sound banks againstthe frightened withdrawals and hoarding. It is giving aid to reopen solventbanks which have been closed. Federal officials have brought about manybeneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which haveprevented many bank closings. As a result of these measures the hoardingwithdrawals which had risen to over $250,000,000 per week after the Britishcrisis have substantially ceased.FURTHER MEASURESThe major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now beenexposed and can be appraised, and the time is ripe for forward action toexpedite our recovery.Although some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation,inflation of securities and real estate, unsound foreign investments, andmismanagement of financial institutions, yet our self contained nationaleconomy, with its matchless strength and resources, would have enabled usto recover long since but for the continued dislocations, shocks, andsetbacks from abroad.Whatever the causes may be, the vast liquidation and readjustments whichhave taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis,which together with the situation in our railways and the conditionsabroad, are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation. If we can putour financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situationin the railways, I am confident we can make a large measure of recoveryindependent of the rest of the world. A strong America is the highestcontribution to world stability.One phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks. During thepast year banks, representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have beenclosed. A large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals forhoarding, as distinguished from the failures early in the depression whereweakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure. Despitetheir closing, many of them will pay in full. Although such withdrawalshave practically ceased, yet $1,100,000,000 of currency was previouslywithdrawn which has still to return to circulation. This represents a largereduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which wouldotherwise fertilize industry and agriculture. Furthermore, many of ourbankers, in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals, havefelt compelled to call in loans, to refuse new credits, and to realize uponsecurities, which in turn has demoralized the markets. The paralysis hasbeen further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of theproportion of bank assets invested in long term securities, such asmortgages and bonds. These securities tend to lose their liquidity indepression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banksto meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and therestriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased. The continuingcredit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidationof commodities, real estate, and securities below any reasonable basis ofvalues.All of this tends to stifle business, especially the smaller units, andfinally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values, inrestriction on new enterprise, and in increased unemployment.The situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence. Wehave enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding. We do notrequire more money or working capital we need to put what we have towork.The fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains inforeign countries do not exist in the United States. No external drain onour resources can threaten our position, because the balance ofinternational payments is in our favor; we owe less to foreign countriesthan they owe to us; our industries are efficiently organized; our currencyand bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history.Our first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thusrestore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life. Wemust put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure. It isour duty to apply the full strength of our Government not only to theimmediate phases, but to provide security against shocks and the repetitionof the weaknesses which have been proven.The recommendations which I here lay before the Congress are designed tomeet these needs by strengthening financial, industrial, and agriculturallife through the medium of our existing institutions, and thus to avoid theentry of the Government into competition with private business.FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCEThe first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financialstability of the United States Government. I shall deal with fiscalquestions at greater length in the Budget message. But I must at this timecall attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed andthe resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies. Thesedeficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due tothe depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid tounemployment, aids to agriculture, and upon services to veterans.During the fiscal year ending June 30 last we incurred a deficit of about$903,000,000, which included the statutory reduction of the debt andrepresented an increase of the national debt by $616,000,000. Of this,however, $153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances.In comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall inFederal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $1,683,000,000,of which $1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone.During this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure, as comparedto 1928, on veterans of $255,000,000, and an increased expenditure onconstruction work which may reach $520,000,000. Despite large economies inother directions, we have an indicated deficit, including the statutoryretirement of the debt, of $2,123,000,000, and an indicated net debtincrease of about $1,711,000,000.The Budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 next, after allowing forsome increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing fordrastic reduction in expenditures, still indicates a deficit of$1,417,000,000. After offsetting the statutory debt retirements this wouldindicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about$921,000,000.Several conclusions are inevitable. We must have insistent and determinedreduction in Government expenses. We must face a temporary increase intaxes. Such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or itwill retard recovery. We must partially finance the deficit by borrowing.It is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balancethe Budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement. SuchGovernment receipts would assure the balance of the following year\'s budgetincluding debt retirement. It is my further view that the additionaltaxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminatingdefinitely two years from July 1 next. Such a basis will give confidence inthe determination of the Government to stabilize its finance and willassure taxpayers of its temporary character. Even with increased taxation,the Government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacityby the expenditures for which we are already obligated and therecommendations here proposed. To go further than these limits in eitherexpenditures, taxes, or borrowing will destroy confidence, denude commerceand industry of its resources, jeopardize the financial system, andactually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieveit.FEDERAL LAND BANKSI recommend that the Congress authorize the subscription by the Treasury offurther capital to the Federal land banks to be retired as provided in theoriginal act, or when funds are available, and that repayments of suchcapital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in thesame manner. It is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilizethe market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers atlow rates, that they may continue their services to agriculture and thatthey may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers.DEPOSITS IN CLOSED BANKSA method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors someportion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks maywarrant. Such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude offamilies, would stabilize values in many communities, and would liberateworking capital to thousands of concerns. I recommend that measures beenacted promptly to accomplish these results and I suggest that theCongress should consider the development of such a plan through the FederalReserve Banks.HOME LOAN DISCOUNT BANKSI recommend the establishment of a system of home loan discount banks asthe necessary companion in our financial structure of the Federal ReserveBanks and our Federal Land Banks. Such action will relieve presentdistressing pressures against home and farm property owners. It willrelieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loanassociations, savings banks, and deposit banks, engaged in extending suchcredits. Such action would further decentralize our credit structure. Itwould revive residential construction and employment. It would enable suchloaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership. Idiscussed this plan at some length in a statement made public November 14,last. This plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent National Conferenceupon Home Ownership and Housing, whose members were designated by thegovernors of the States and the groups interested.RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATIONIn order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the Governmentmay be in position to meet any public necessity, I recommend that anemergency Reconstruction Corporation of the nature of the former WarFinance Corporation should be established. It may not be necessary to usesuch an instrumentality very extensively. The very existence of such abulwark will strengthen confidence. The Treasury should be authorized tosubscribe a reasonable capital to it, and it should be given authority toissue its own debentures. It should be placed in liquidation at the end oftwo years. Its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thusliberate the full strength of the Nation\'s resources. It should be inposition to facilitate exports by American agencies; make advances toagricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid theagricultural industry; to make temporary advances upon proper securities toestablished industries, railways, and financial institutions which can nototherwise secure credit, and where such advances will protect the creditstructure and stimulate employment. Its functions would not overlap thoseof the National Credit Corporation.FEDERAL RESERVE ELIGIBILITYOn October 6th I issued a statement that I should recommend to the Congressan extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in theFederal reserve act. This statement was approved by a representativegathering of the Members of both Houses of the Congress, including membersof the appropriate committees. It was approved by the officials of theTreasury Department, and I understand such an extension has been approvedby a majority of the governors of the Federal reserve banks. Nothing shouldbe done which would lower the safeguards of the system.The establishment of the mortgage discount banks herein referred to willalso contribute to further reserve strength in the banks withoutinflation.BANKING LAWSOur people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shallbe safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms. The need of asounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures. I recommendthe prompt improvement of the banking laws. Changed financial conditionsand commercial practices must be met. The Congress should investigate theneed for separation between different kinds of banking; an enlargement ofbranch banking under proper restrictions; and the methods by which enlargedmembership in the Federal reserve system may be brought about.POSTAL SAVINGS BANKSThe Postal Savings deposits have increased from about $200,000,000 to about$550,000,000 during the past year. This experience has raised importantpractical questions in relation to deposits and investments which shouldreceive the attention of the Congress.RAILWAYSThe railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems. They areand must remain the backbone of our transportation system. Their prosperityis interrelated with the prosperity of all industries. Their fundamentalservice in transportation, the volume of their employment, their buyingpower for supplies from other industries, the enormous investment in theirsecurities, particularly their bonds, by insurance companies, savingsbanks, benevolent and other trusts, all reflect their partnership in thewhole economic fabric. Through these institutions the railway bonds are ina large sense the investment of every family. The well maintained andsuccessful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primaryimportance to economic recovery. They should have more effectiveopportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation. As theirrates must be regulated in public interest, so also approximate regulationshould be applied to competing services by some authority. The methods oftheir regulation should be revised. The Interstate Commerce Commission hasmade important and far reaching recommendations upon the whole subject,which I commend to the early consideration of the Congress.ANTITRUST LAWSIn my message of a year ago I commented on the necessity of congressionalinquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws. There is wideconviction that some change should be made especially in the procedureunder these laws. I do not favor their repeal. Such action would open widethe door to price fixing, monopoly, and destruction of healthy competition.Particular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon naturalresources, especially where destructive competition produces great wastesof these resources and brings great hardships upon operators, employees,and the public. In recent years there has been continued demoralization inthe bituminous coal, oil, and lumber industries. I again commend the matterto the consideration of the Congress.UNEMPLOYMENTAs an aid to unemployment the Federal Government is engaged in the greatestprogram of public building, harbor, flood control, highway, waterway,aviation, merchant and naval ship construction in all history. Ourexpenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about$780,000,000 compared with $260,000,000 in 1928. Through this increasedconstruction, through the maintenance of a full complement of Federalemployees, and through services to veterans it is estimated that theFederal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of10,000,000 of our citizens.We must avoid burdens upon the Government which will create moreunemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion ofemployment by the Federal Government. We can now stimulate employment andagriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures inprogress, through the thawing out of credit, through the building up ofstability abroad, through the home loan discount banks, through anemergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways andother such directions.I am opposed to any direct or indirect Government dole. The breakdown andincreased unemployment in Europe is due in part to such practices. Ourpeople are providing against distress from unemployment in true Americanfashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of thelocal governments.GENERAL LEGISLATIONThere are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this sessionof the Congress. I may list the following among them:VETERANS\' SERVICESThe law enacted last March authorizing loans of 50 per cent uponadjusted service certificates has, together with the loans made underprevious laws, resulted in payments of about $1,260,000,000. Appropriationshave been exhausted. The Administrator of Veterans\' Affairs advises that afurther appropriation of $200,000,000 is required at once to meet theobligations made necessary by existing legislation.There will be demands for further veterans\' legislation; there areinequalities in our system of veterans\' relief; it is our national duty tomeet our obligations to those who have served the Nation. But our presentexpenditure upon these services now exceeds $1,000,000,000 per annum. I amopposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country hasrecovered from the present situation.ELECTRICAL POWER REGULATIONI have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation ofinterstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganizedFederal Power Commission. I renew the recommendation. It is urgently neededin public protection.MUSCLE SHOALSAt my suggestion, the Governors and Legislatures of Alabama and Tennesseeselected three members each for service on a committee to which I appointeda representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of theWar Department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal ofthese properties which would be in the interest of the people of thoseStates and the agricultural industry throughout the country. I shalltransmit the recommendations to the Congress.REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL DEPARTMENTSI have referred in previous messages to the profound need of furtherreorganization and consolidation of Federal administrative functions toeliminate overlap and waste, and to enable coordination and definition ofGovernment policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflictingagencies which deal with parts of the same major function. I shall laybefore the Congress further recommendations upon this subject, particularlyin relation to the Department of the Interior. There are two directions ofsuch reorganization, however, which have an important bearing upon theemergency problems with which we are confronted.SHIPPING BOARDAt present the Shipping Board exercises large administrative functionsindependent of the Executive. These administrative functions should betransferred to the Department of Commerce, in keeping with that singleresponsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure sinceits foundation. There should be created in that department a position ofAssistant Secretary for Merchant Marine, under whom this work and theseveral bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped.The Shipping Board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisorycapacity on loans and policies, in keeping with its original conception.Its regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwiseshipping so as to assure stability and better service. It is also worthy ofconsideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inlandwaterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board.REORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC WORKS ADMINISTRATIONI recommend that all building and construction activities of the Governmentnow carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independentestablishment under the President to be known as the "Public WorksAdministration" directed by a Public Works Administrator. This agencyshould undertake all construction work in service to the differentdepartments of the Government (except naval and military work). Theservices of the Corps of Army Engineers should be delegated in rotation formilitary duty to this administration in continuation of their supervisionof river and harbor work. Great economies, sounder policies, more effectivecoordination to employment, and expedition in all construction work wouldresult from this consolidation.LAW ENFORCEMENTI shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to thestrengthening of criminal law enforcement and improvement in judicialprocedure connected therewith.INLAND WATERWAY AND HARBOR IMPROVEMENTThese improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale. Someindication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact thatduring the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have beenmoved an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of thePanama Canal. The Mississippi waterway system, connecting Chicago, KansasCity, Pittsburgh, and New Orleans, will be in full operation during 1933.Substantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper Missouri,upper Mississippi, etc.Negotiations are now in progress with Canada for the construction of theSt. Lawrence Waterway.THE TARIFFWages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered duringthe past year. The temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certaincountries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours.Fortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protectagriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs, or decreases initems which may prove to be excessive, may be undertaken at any time by theTariff Commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of thetariff act of 1930. The commission during the past year has reviewed therates upon over 254 items subject to tariff. As a result of vigorous andindustrious action, it is up to date in the consideration of pendingreferences and is prepared to give prompt attention to any furtherapplications. This procedure presents an orderly method for correctinginequalities. I am opposed to any general congressional revision of thetariff. Such action would disturb industry, business, and agriculture. Itwould prolong the depression.IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATIONI recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrativeaction be placed upon a more definite basis by law. The deportation lawsshould be strengthened. Aliens lawfully in the country should be protectedby the issuance of a certificate of residence.PUBLIC HEALTHI again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject,particularly in its relation to children. The moral results are of theutmost importance.CONCLUSIONIt is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed tothe Congress and many of the recommendations of the Executive must bedesigned to meet emergencies. In reaching solutions we must not jeopardizethose principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of theNation. The Federal Government must not encroach upon nor permit localcommunities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative andresponsibility. Again, just as the largest measure of responsibility in thegovernment of the Nation rests upon local self government, so does thelargest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon theindividual. If the individual surrenders his own initiative andresponsibilities, he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty.It is the duty of the National Government to insist that both the localgovernments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilitiesas a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom.Many vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place inthe economic world. The effect of these changes upon the future can not beseen clearly as yet. Of this, however, we are sure: Our system, based uponthe ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity, is notan artificial thing. Rather it is the outgrowth of the experience ofAmerica, and expresses the faith and spirit of our people. It has carriedus in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world. If oureconomic system does not match our highest expectations at all times, itdoes not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with anynecessity that experience may prove. It has successfully adjusted itself tochanging conditions in the past. It will do so again. The mobility of ourinstitutions, the richness of our resources, and the abilities of ourpeople enable us to meet them unafraid. It is a distressful time for manyof our people, but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude, courage,and resourcefulness as ever in our history. With that spirit, I have faiththat out of it will come a sounder life, a truer standard of values, agreater recognition of the results of honest effort, and a healthieratmosphere in which to rear our children. Ours must be a country of suchstability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge amongall the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunitywhich it has represented among all nations since its beginning.The White House,December 8, 1931
Herbert Hoover
To the Senate and House of Representatives:In accord with my constitutional duty, I transmit herewith to theCongress information upon the state of the Union together withrecommendation of measures for its consideration.Our country is at peace. Our national defense has been maintained at ahigh state of effectiveness. All of the executive departments of theGovernment have been conducted during the year with a high devotion topublic interest. There has been a far larger degree of freedom fromindustrial conflict than hitherto known. Education and science have madefurther advances. The public health is to day at its highest knownlevel. While we have recently engaged in the aggressive contest of anational election, its very tranquillity and the acceptance of itsresults furnish abundant proof of the strength of our institutions.In the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily amagnificent sense of humanity, of individual and communityresponsibility for the welfare of the less fortunate. They have grown intheir conceptions and organization for cooperative action for the commonwelfare.In the provision against distress during this winter, the great privateagencies of the country have been mobilized again; the generosity of ourpeople has again come into evidence to a degree in which all America maytake great pride. Likewise the local authorities and the States areengaged everywhere in supplemental measures of relief. The provisionsmade for loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, to Statesthat have exhausted their own resources, guarantee that there should beno hunger or suffering from cold in the country. The large majority ofStates are showing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the Federalaid.The Surgeon General, in charge of the Public Health Service, furnishesme with the following information upon the state of public health:MORTALITY RATE PER 1,000 OF POPULATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROMREPRESENTATIVE STATESGeneral InfantFirst 9 months of  1928 11.9 67.8 1929 12.0 65.8 1930 11.4 62.0 193111.2 60.0 1932 10.6 55.0The sickness rates from data available show the same trends. These factsindicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized forcare of those in distress.ECONOMIC SITUATIONThe unparalleled world wide economic depression has continued throughthe year. Due to the European collapse, the situation developed duringlast fall and winter into a series of most acute crises. Theunprecedented emergency measures enacted and policies adoptedundoubtedly saved the country from economic disaster. After serving todefend the national security, these measures began in July to show theirweight and influence toward improvement of conditions in many parts ofthe country. The following tables of current business indicators showthe general economic movement during the past eleven months.MONTHLY BUSINESS INDICES WITH SEASONAL VARIATIONS ELIMINATED [Monthlyaverage 1923 1925=100]Industrial Factory Freight  Depart  Exports, Imports, BuildingIndustrial Year and produc  employ  car ment store value valuecontracts, electric month tion ment loadings sales, all types powervalue consumption1931 December 74 69.4 69 81 46 48 38 89.11932 January 72 68.1 64 78 39 42 31 93.9 February 69 67.8 62 78 45 41 2798.8 March 67 66.4 61 72 41 37 26 88.0 April 63 64.3 59 80 38 36 27 82.2May 60 62.1 54 73 37 34 26 82.0 June 59 60.0 52 71 34 36 27 78.1 July 5858.3 51 67 32 27 27 79.2 August 60 58.8 51 66 31 29 30 73.5 September 6660.3 54 70 33 32 30 84.0 October 66 61.3 57 70 33 32 29 84.4The measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recoveryshould be continued until the depression is passed, and then theemergency agencies should be promptly liquidated. The expansion ofcredit facilities by the Federal Reserve System and the ReconstructionFinance Corporation has been of incalculable value. The loans of thelatter for reproductive works, and to railways for the creation ofemployment; its support of the credit structure through loans to banks,insurance companies, railways, building and loan associations, and toagriculture has protected the savings and insurance policies of millionsof our citizens and has relieved millions of borrowers from duress; theyhave enabled industry and business to function and expand. Theassistance given to Farm Loan Banks, the establishment of the Home LoanBanks and Agricultural Credit Associations all in their variousramifications have placed large sums of money at the disposal of thepeople in protection and aid. Beyond this, the extensive organization ofthe country in voluntary action has produced profound results.The following table indicates direct expenditures of the FederalGovernment in aid to unemployment, agriculture, and financial reliefover the past four years. The sums applied to financial relief multiplythemselves many fold, being in considerable measure the initial capitalsupplied to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Farm Loan Banks,etc., which will be recovered to the Treasury.Agricultural Public works 1 relief and financial loansFiscal year ending June 30  1930 $410,420,000 $156,100,000 1931574,870,000 196,700,000 1932 655,880,000 772,700,000 1933 717,260,00052,000,000Total 2,358,430,000 1,177,500,000 1 Public Building, Highways, Riversand Harbors and their maintenance, naval and other vessels construction,hospitals, etc.Continued constructive policies promoting the economic recovery of thecountry must be the paramount duty of the Government. The result of theagencies we have created and the policies we have pursued has been tobuttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restorecredit facilities. But progress in recovery requires another element aswell that is fully restored confidence in the future. Institutions andmen may have resources and credit but unless they have confidenceprogress is halting and insecure.There are three definite directions in which action by the Government atonce can contribute to strengthen further the forces of recovery bystrengthening of confidence. They are the necessary foundations to anyother action, and their accomplishment would at once promote employmentand increase prices.The first of these directions of action is the continuing reduction ofall Government expenditures, whether national, State, or local. Thedifficulties of the country demand undiminished efforts toward economyin government in every direction. Embraced in this problem is theunquestioned balancing of the Federal Budget. That is the firstnecessity of national stability and is the foundation of furtherrecovery. It must be balanced in an absolutely safe and sure manner iffull confidence is to be inspired.The second direction for action is the complete reorganization at onceof our banking system. The shocks to our economic life have undoubtedlybeen multiplied by the weakness of this system, and until they areremedied recovery will be greatly hampered.The third direction for immediate action is vigorous and whole souledcooperation with other governments in the economic field. That our majordifficulties find their origins in the economic weakness of foreignnations requires no demonstration. The first need to day isstrengthening of commodity prices. That can not be permanentlyaccomplished by artificialities. It must be accomplished by expansion inconsumption of goods through the return of stability and confidence inthe world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplishedwithout cooperation with other nations.BALANCING THE BUDGETI shall in due course present the Executive Budget to the Congress. Itwill show proposed reductions in appropriations below those enacted bythe last session of the Congress by over $830,000,000. In addition Ishall present the necessary Executive orders under the recent actauthorizing the reorganization of the Federal Government which, ifpermitted to go into force, will produce still further substantialeconomies. These sums in reduction of appropriations will, however, bepartially offset by an increase of about $250,000,000 in uncontrollableitems such as increased debt services, etc.In the Budget there is included only the completion of the Federalpublic works projects already undertaken or under contract. Speeding upof Federal public works during the past four years as an aid toemployment has advanced many types of such improvements to the pointwhere further expansion can not be justified in their usefulness to theGovernment or the people. As an aid to unemployment we should beyond thenormal constructive programs substitute reproductive or so calledself liquidating works. Loans for such purposes have been provided forthrough the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This change in characterof projects directly relieves the taxpayer and is capable of expansioninto a larger field than the direct Federal works. The reproductiveworks constitute an addition to national wealth and to futureemployment, whereas further undue expansion of Federal public works isbut a burden upon the future.The Federal construction program thus limited to commitments and work inprogress under the proposed appropriations contemplates expenditures forthe next fiscal year, including naval and other vessel construction, aswell as other forms of public works and maintenance, of a total of$442,769,000, as compared with $717,262,000 for the present year.The expenditure on such items over the four years ending June 30 nextwill amount to $2,350,000,000, or an amount of construction work eighttimes as great as the cost of the Panama Canal and, except forcompletion of certain long view projects, places the Nation in manydirections well ahead of its requirements for some years to come. Anormal program of about $200,000,000 per annum should hereafter providefor the country\'s necessities and will permit substantial futurereduction in Federal expenditures.I recommend that the furlough system installed last year be continuednot only because of the economy produced but because, being tantamountto the "5 day week," it sets an example which should be followed by thecountry and because it embraces within its workings the "spread work"principle and thus serves to maintain a number of public servants whowould otherwise be deprived of all income. I feel, however, in view ofthe present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of living byover 20 per cent, that some further sacrifice should be made by salariedofficials of the Government over and above the 8 1/3 per cent reductionunder the furlough system. I will recommend that after exempting thefirst $1,000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for oneyear of 11 per cent of that part of all Government salaries in excess ofthe $1,000 exemption, the result of which, combined with the furloughsystem, will average about 14.8 per cent reduction in pay to thoseearning more than $1,000.I will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans\'services. I conceive these outlays were entirely beyond the originalintentions of Congress in building up veterans\' allowances. Many abuseshave grown up from ill considered legislation. They should beeliminated. The Nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances tomen and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor tothose veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabledfrom non war connected causes and who are at the same time without othersupport. These latter veterans are a charge on the community at somepoint, and I feel that in view of their service to the Nation as a wholethe responsibility should fall upon the Federal Government.Many of the economies recommended in the Budget were presented at thelast session of the Congress but failed of adoption. If the Economy andAppropriations Committees of the Congress in canvassing these proposedexpenditures shall find further reductions which can be made withoutimpairing essential Government services, it will be welcomed both by thecountry and by myself. But under no circumstances do I feel that theCongress should fail to uphold the total of reductions recommended.Some of the older revenues and some of the revenues provided under theact passed during the last session of the Congress, particularly thosegenerally referred to as the nuisance taxes, have not been as prolificof income as had been hoped. Further revenue is necessary in addition tothe amount of reductions in expenditures recommended. Many of themanufacturers\' excise taxes upon selected industries not only failed toproduce satisfactory revenue, but they are in many ways unjust anddiscriminatory. The time has come when, if the Government is to have anadequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced Budget, this system ofspecial manufacturers\' excise taxes should be extended to coverpractically all manufactures at a uniform rate, except necessary foodand possibly some grades of clothing.At the last session the Congress responded to my request for authorityto reorganize the Government departments. The act provides for thegrouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agenciesaccording to major purpose, and thereby reducing the number and overlapand duplication of effort. Executive orders issued for these purposesare required to be transmitted to the Congress while in session and donot become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar daysafter such transmission, unless the Congress shall sooner approve.I shall issue such Executive orders within a few days grouping orconsolidating over fifty executive and administrative agencies includinga large number of commissions and "independent" agencies.The second step, of course, remains that after these various bureaus andagencies are placed cheek by jowl into such groups, the administrativeofficers in charge of the groups shall eliminate their overlap and stillfurther consolidate these activities. Therein lie large economies.The Congress must be warned that a host of interested persons inside andoutside the Government whose vision is concentrated on some particularfunction will at once protest against these proposals. These same sortsof activities have prevented reorganization of the Government for over aquarter of a century. They must be disregarded if the task is to beaccomplished.BANKINGThe basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery is toreorganize at once our banking system. The shocks to our economic systemhave undoubtedly multiplied by the weakness of our financial system. Ifirst called attention of the Congress in 1929 to this condition, and Ihave unceasingly recommended remedy since that time. The subject hasbeen exhaustively investigated both by the committees of the Congressand the officers of the Federal Reserve System.The banking and financial system is presumed to serve in furnishing theessential lubricant to the wheels of industry, agriculture, andcommerce, that is, credit. Its diversion from proper use, its improperuse, or its insufficiency instantly brings hardship and dislocation ineconomic life. As a system our banking has failed to meet this greatemergency. It can be said without question of doubt that our losses anddistress have been greatly augmented by its wholly inadequateorganization. Its inability as a system to respond to our needs isto day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery. In this statementI am not referring to individual banks or bankers. Thousands of themhave shown distinguished courage and ability. On the contrary, I amreferring to the system itself, which is so organized, or so lacking inorganization, that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardizes orparalyzes the action of sound banks and its instability is responsiblefor periodic dangers to our whole economic system.Bank failures rose in 1931 to 10 1/2 per cent of all the banks ascompared to 1 1/2 per cent of the failures of all other types ofenterprise. Since January 1, 1930, we have had 4,665 banks suspend, with$3,300,000,000 in deposits. Partly from fears and drains from abroad,partly from these failures themselves (which indeed often caused closingof sound banks), we have witnessed hoarding of currency to an enormoussum, rising during the height of the crisis to over $1,600,000,000. Theresults from interreaction of cause and effect have expressed themselvesin strangulation of credit which at times has almost stifled theNation\'s business and agriculture. The losses, suffering, and tragediesof our people are incalculable. Not alone do they lie in the losses ofsavings to millions of homes, injury by deprival of working capital tothousands of small businesses, but also, in the frantic pressure torecall loans to meet pressures of hoarding and in liquidation of failedbanks, millions of other people have suffered in the loss of their homesand farms, businesses have been ruined, unemployment increased, andfarmers\' prices diminished.That this failure to function is unnecessary and is the fault of ourparticular system is plainly indicated by the fact that in GreatBritain, where the economic mechanism has suffered far greater shocksthan our own, there has not been a single bank failure during thedepression. Again in Canada, where the situation has been in largedegree identical with our own, there have not been substantial bankfailures.The creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and theamendments to the Federal Reserve Act served to defend the Nation in agreat crisis. They are not remedies; they are relief. It isinconceivable that the Reconstruction Corporation, which has extendedaid to nearly 6,000 institutions and is manifestly but a temporarydevice, can go on indefinitely.It is to day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failures, ofhoarding, and the demands upon the Reconstruction Corporation havegreatly lessened. The acute phases of the crisis have obviously passedand the time has now come when this national danger and this failure torespond to national necessities must be ended and the measures to endthem can be safely undertaken. Methods of reform have been exhaustivelyexamined. There is no reason now why solution should not be found at thepresent session of the Congress. Inflation of currency or governmentalconduct of banking can have no part in these reforms. The Governmentmust abide within the field of constructive organization, regulation,and the enforcement of safe practices only.Parallel with reform in the banking laws must be changes in the FederalFarm Loan Banking system and in the Joint Stock Land Banks. Some ofthese changes should be directed to permanent improvement and some toemergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farmsand homes.I wish again to emphasize this view that these widespread bankingreforms are a national necessity and are the first requisites forfurther recovery in agriculture and business. They should have immediateconsideration as steps greatly needed to further recovery.ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH OTHER NATIONSOur major difficulties during the past two years find their origins inthe shocks from economic collapse abroad which in turn are the aftermathof the Great War. If we are to secure rapid and assured recovery andprotection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nations in manymeasures.We have actively engaged in a World Disarmament Conference where, withsuccess, we should reduce our own tax burdens and the tax burdens ofother major nations. We should increase political stability of theworld. We should lessen the danger of war by increasing defensive powersand decreasing offensive powers of nations. We would thus open newvistas of economic expansion for the world.We are participating in the formulation of a World Economic Conference,successful results from which would contribute much to advance inagricultural prices, employment, and business. Currency depreciation andcorrelated forces have contributed greatly to decrease in price levels.Moreover, from these origins rise most of the destructive trade barriersnow stifling the commerce of the world. We could by successful actionincrease security and expand trade through stability in internationalexchange and monetary values. By such action world confidence could berestored. It would bring courage and stability, which will reflect intoevery home in our land.The European governments, obligated to us in war debts, have requestedthat there should be suspension of payments due the United States onDecember 15 next, to be accompanied by exchange of views upon this debtquestion. Our Government has informed them that we do not approve ofsuspension of the December 15 payments. I have stated that I wouldrecommend to the Congress methods to overcome temporary exchangedifficulties in connection with this payment from nations where it maybe necessary.In the meantime I wish to reiterate that here are three great fields ofinternational action which must be considered not in part but as awhole. They are of most vital interest to our people. Within them thereare not only grave dangers if we fail in right action but there also tieimmense opportunities for good if we shall succeed. Within success therelie major remedies for our economic distress and major progress instability and security to every fireside in our country.The welfare of our people is dependent upon successful issue of thegreat causes of world peace, world disarmament, and organized worldrecovery. Nor is it too much to say that to day as never before thewelfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon oursolution of these questions. Such solutions can not be attained exceptby honest friendship, by adherence to agreements entered upon untilmutually revised and by cooperation amongst nations in a determinationto find solutions which will be mutually beneficial.OTHER LEGISLATIONI have placed various legislative needs before the Congress in previousmessages, and these views require no amplification on this occasion. Ihave urged the need for reform in our transportation and powerregulation, in the antitrust laws as applied to our national resourceindustries, western range conservation, extension of Federal aid tochild health services, membership in the World Court, the ratificationof the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Treaty, revision of thebankruptcy acts, revision of Federal court procedure, and many otherpressing problems.These and other special subjects I shall where necessary deal with byspecial communications to the Congress.The activities of our Government are so great, when combined with theemergency activities which have arisen out of the world crisis, thateven the briefest review of them would render the annual message undulylong. I shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail ofthe Government is covered in the reports to the Congress by each of thedepartments and agencies of the Government.CONCLUSIONIt seems to me appropriate upon this occasion to make certain generalobservations upon the principles which must dominate the solution ofproblems now pressing upon the Nation. Legislation in response tonational needs will be effective only if every such act conforms to acomplete philosophy of the people\'s purposes and destiny. Ours is adistinctive government with a unique history and background, consciouslydedicated to specific ideals of liberty and to a faith in the inviolablesanctity of the individual human spirit. Furthermore, the continuedexistence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation ofordered liberty and stimulation of progress depends upon the maintenanceof State, local, institutional, and individual sense of responsibility.We have builded a system of individualism peculiarly our own which mustnot be forgotten in any governmental acts, for from it have growngreater accomplishments than those of any other nation.On the social and economic sides, the background of our American systemand the motivation of progress is essentially that we should allow freeplay of social and economic forces as far as will not limit equality ofopportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative andenterprise of our people. In the maintenance of this balance the FederalGovernment can permit of no privilege to any person or group. It shouldact as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic andsocial life. The moment the Government participates, it becomes acompetitor with the people. As a competitor it becomes at once a tyrannyin whatever direction it may touch. We have around us numerous suchexperiences, no one of which can be found to have justified itselfexcept in cases where the people as a whole have met forces beyond theircontrol, such as those of the Great War and this great depression, wherethe full powers of the Federal Government must be exerted to protect thepeople. But even these must be limited to an emergency sense and must bepromptly ended when these dangers are overcome.With the free development of science and the consequent multitude ofinventions, some of which are absolutely revolutionary in our nationallife, the Government must not only stimulate the social and economicresponsibility of individuals and private institutions but it must alsogive leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which willsoften the effect of these revolutions and thus secure socialtransformations in an orderly manner. The highest form ofself government is the voluntary cooperation within our people for suchpurposes.But I would emphasize again that social and economic solutions, as such,will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless theyconform with the traditions of our race deeply grooved in theirsentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of lifethat are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs.HERBERT HOOVER The White House, December 6, 1932.
Richard Nixon
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, ourdistinguished guests and my fellow Americans:To address a joint session of the Congress in this great Chamber in which Iwas once privileged to serve is an honor for which I am deeply grateful.The State of the Union Address is traditionally an occasion for a lengthyand detailed account by the President of what he has accomplished in thepast, what he wants the Congress to do in the future, and, in an electionyear, to lay the basis for the political issues which might be decisive inthe fall.Occasionally there comes a time when profound and far reaching eventscommand a break with tradition. This is such a time.I say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade inwhich America will celebrate its 200th birthday. I say it because newknowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs andour institutions in America need to be reformed.The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of thisland to the creation of a new American experience, an experience richer anddeeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the humanspirit.The seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both onthe earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery. But the time has alsocome for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and ofcompleting what man\'s genius has begun but left unfinished.Our land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land. Itis also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is thesummons of the seventies.It is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing ourNation which are above partisanship.When we speak of America\'s priorities the first priority must always bepeace for America and the world.The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to thewar in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so muchas the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we hadthe courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the nextgeneration was able to keep.We are making progress toward that goal.The prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.A major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of thisCongress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war, haveoverwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace. By this action, youhave completely demolished the enemy\'s hopes that they can gain inWashington the victory our fighting men have denied them in Vietnam.No goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in thiscentury in which America was at peace with every nation in the world.I shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achievethis goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall submit tothe Congress at a later date.Today, let me describe the directions of our new policies.We have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not asit was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II. Many of the policieswhich were necessary and right then are obsolete today.Then, because of America\'s overwhelming military and economic strength,because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inabilityof scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even govern,themselves, America had to assume the major burden for the defense offreedom in the world.In two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of themoney, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend theirfreedom.Today the great industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, haveregained their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America andmany of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after WorldWar II in Asia and Africa have a new sense of pride and dignity and adetermination to assume the responsibility for their own defense.That is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam.Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusivelyor primarily an American undertaking.The nations of each part of the world should assume the primaryresponsibility for their own well being; and they themselves shoulddetermine the terms of that well being.We shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce ourinvolvement and our presence in other nations\' affairs.To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat fromresponsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.The result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but togive them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose.Relations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy, basedon mutual consultation and mutual responsibility.We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal withthose nations as partners rather than patrons.The new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia. We have developed anhistoric new basis for Japanese American friendship and cooperation, whichis the linchpin for peace in the Pacific.If we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factorwill be the development of a new relationship between the United States andthe Soviet Union.I would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with precisionand purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.Our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will havefar greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutualself interest rather than naive sentimentality.It is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with CommunistChina in our talks at Warsaw.Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid acatastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlementof our differences.I would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult anddangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the prospectthat America may have the best chance since World War II to enjoy ageneration of uninterrupted peace. And that chance will be enormouslyincreased if we continue to have a relationship between Congress and theExecutive in which, despite differences in detail, where the security ofAmerica and the peace of mankind are concerned, we act not as Republicans,not as Democrats, but as Americans.As we move into the decade of the seventies, we have the greatestopportunity for progress at home of any people in world history.Our gross national product will increase by $500 billion in the next 10years. This increase alone is greater than the entire growth of theAmerican economy from 1790 to 1950.The critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use thatgrowth.The decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically.But in that same 10 year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime,the greatest increase in inflation, the greatest social unrest in Americain 100 years. Never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed itless.At heart, the issue is the effectiveness of government.Ours has become as it continues to be, and should remain a society oflarge expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. Itundertook to meet them. Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so.As a people, we had too many visions and too little vision.Now, as we enter the seventies, we should enter also a great age of reformof the institutions of American government.Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of theprograms of the past. The time has come for a new quest a quest not for agreater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life inAmerica.A major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this Nation\'sapproach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than twoscore legislative proposals which I sent to the Congress last year andwhich still await enactment.I will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of thissession.At this point I do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what Ihave proposed or will propose, but I would like to mention three areas inwhich urgent priorities demand that we move and move now:First, we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of ourwelfare system. When a system penalizes work, breaks up homes, robsrecipients of dignity, there is no alternative to abolishing that systemand adopting in its place the program of income support, job training, andwork incentives which I recommended to the Congress last year.Second, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions ofgovernment at the Federal, State, and local level. It is time for a NewFederalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the people andlocal and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will begin to flow fromWashington back to the States and to the people of the United States.Third, we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunitiesfor all Americans. We can fulfill the American dream only when each personhas a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams. This means equal votingrights, equal employment opportunity, and new opportunities for expandedownership. Because in order to be secure in their human rights, people needaccess to property rights.I could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs forhealth, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical areaswhich directly affect the well being of millions of Americans.The people of the United States should wait no longer for these reformsthat would so deeply enhance the quality of their life.When I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American people, Ican think of none more important than for the Congress to join thisadministration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living.Now, I realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation. Someblame business for raising prices. Some blame unions for asking for morewages.But a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960\'s clearly demonstrateswhere the primary blame for rising prices must be placed.In the decade of the sixties the Federal Government spent $57 billion morethan it took in in taxes.In that same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit inprice increases which raised the cost of living for the average family offour by $200 per month in America.Now millions of Americans are forced to go into debt today because theFederal Government decided to go into debt yesterday. We must balance ourFederal budget so that American families will have a better chance tobalance their family budgets.Only with the cooperation of the Congress can we meet this highest priorityobjective of responsible government. We are on the right track.We had a balanced budget in 1969. This administration cut more than $7billion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970, and inspite of the fact that Congress reduced revenues by $3 billion, I shallrecommend a balanced budget for 1971.But I can assure you that not only to present, but to stay within, abalanced budget requires some very hard decisions. It means rejectingspending programs which would benefit some of the people when their neteffect would result in price increases for all the people.It is time to quit putting good money into bad programs. Otherwise, we willend up with bad money and bad programs.I recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and particularlyin an election year. But unless we stop the rise in prices, the cost ofliving for millions of American families will become unbearable andgovernment\'s ability to plan programs for progress for the future willbecome impossible.In referring to budget cuts, there is one area where I have ordered anincrease rather than a cut and that is the requests of those agencies withthe responsibilities for law enforcement.We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties inwhich the word "war" has perhaps too often been used the war on poverty,the war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger. But if there isone area where the word "war" is appropriate it is in the fight againstcrime. We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements whichincreasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives.We have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation\'s Capital, for whosesafety the Congress and the Executive have the primary responsibility. Idoubt if many Members of this Congress who live more than a few blocks fromhere would dare leave their cars in the Capitol garage and walk home alonetonight.Last year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces oflegislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime,narcotics, crime in the District of Columbia.None of these bills has reached my desk for signature.I am confident that the Congress will act now to adopt the legislation Iplaced before you last year. We in the Executive have done everything wecan under existing law, but new and stronger weapons are needed in thatfight.While it is true that State and local law enforcement agencies are thecutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime, burglaries, murder,my proposals to you have embodied my belief that the Federal Governmentshould play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies.That is why 1971 Federal spending for local law enforcement will doublethat budgeted for 1970.The primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with localand State rather than with Federal Government. But in the field oforganized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has aspecial responsibility it should fulfill. And we should make Washington,D.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nationand the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness.I now turn to a subject which, next to our desire for peace, may wellbecome the major concern of the American people in the decade of theseventies.In the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent. Theprofound question is: Does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a realsense, 50 percent better off, 50 percent happier?Or does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this placewill look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived inmetropolitan areas choked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned bywater, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?These are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summitconferences. But people do not live at the summit. They live in thefoothills of everyday experience, and it is time for all of us to concernourselves with the way real people live in real life.The great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to oursurroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to makereparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to ourwater?Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyondfactions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country.It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they morethan we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programswhich are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.Clean air, clean water, open spaces these should once again be thebirthright of every American. If we act now, they can be.We still think of air as free. But clean air is not free, and neither isclean water. The price tag on pollution control is high. Through our yearsof past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature, and now that debt isbeing called.The program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive andcostly program in this field in America\'s history.It is not a program for just one year. A year\'s plan in this field is noplan at all. This is a time to look ahead not a year, but 5 years or 10years whatever time is required to do the job.I shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean watersprogram to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place inAmerica where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do itnow. We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them allwithin 5 years. This program will get them built within 5 years.As our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand, those priceless open spacesneeded for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowedup often forever. Unless we preserve these spaces while they are stillavailable, we will have none to preserve. Therefore, I shall propose newfinancing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now, before theyare lost to us.The automobile is our worst polluter of the air. Adequate control requiresfurther advances in engine design and fuel composition. We shall intensifyour research, set increasingly strict standards, and strengthen enforcementprocedures and we shall do it now.We can no longer afford to consider air and water common property, free tobe abused by anyone without regard to the consequences. Instead, we shouldbegin now to treat them as scarce resources, which we are no more free tocontaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbor\'s yard.This requires comprehensive new regulations. It also requires that, to theextent possible, the price of goods should be made to include the costs ofproducing and disposing of them without damage to the environment.Now, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamentalcontradiction between economic growth and the quality of life, so that tohave one we must forsake the other.The answer is not to abandon growth, but to redirect it. For example, weshould turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the samereservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place.Continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrichlife itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man.Each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won.It has been said that no matter how many national parks and historicalmonuments we buy and develop, the truly significant environment for each ofus is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time in our homes, in ourplaces of work, the streets over which we travel.Street litter, rundown parking strips and yards, dilapidated fences, brokenwindows, smoking automobiles, dingy working places, all should be theobject of our fresh view.We have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave itto others to clean up our environment. It is time for those who makemassive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves. Eachof us must resolve that each day he will leave his home, his property, thepublic places of the city or town a little cleaner, a little better, alittle more pleasant for himself and those around him.With the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we cando nothing. In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for ours andgenerations to come.Between now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born inthe United States. Where they grow up and how will, more than any onething, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead.This should be a warning to us.For the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.The result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying outof people and of promise a third of our counties lost population in thesixties.The violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexesare the most conspicuous area of failure in American life today.I propose that before these problems become insoluble, the Nation develop anational growth policy.In the future, government decisions as to where to build highways, locateairports, acquire land, or sell land should be made with a clear objectiveof aiding a balanced growth for America.In particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist inthe building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones.At the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life inAmerica to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to thecity. What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance. It needsto be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an overallgrowth policy for America. We must create a new rural environment whichwill not only stem the migration to urban centers, but reverse it. If weseize our growth as a challenge, we can make the 1970\'s an historic periodwhen by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it tobecome.America, which has pioneered in the new abundance, and in the newtechnology, is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns whichhave followed in their wake in turning the wonders of science to theservice of man.In the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America\'shistory, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, ofthe summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the people,the building of a nation.Those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.They remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which atone critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road tothe future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it.As I look down that new road which I have tried to map out today, I see anew America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now.I see an America in which we have abolished hunger, provided the means forevery family in the Nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormousprogress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improvedhealth, and superior education.I see an America in which we have checked inflation, and waged a winningwar against crime.I see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping thepollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks,continuing to explore in space.Most important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of theworld.This is not an impossible dream. These goals are all within our reach.In times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achievesuch goals.Let it not be recorded that we were the first American generation that hadthe means but not the vision to make this dream come true.But let us, above all, recognize a fundamental truth. We can be the bestclothed, best fed, best housed people in the world, enjoying clean air,clean water, beautiful parks, but we could still be the unhappiest peoplein the world without an indefinable spirit the lift of a driving dreamwhich has made America, from its beginning, the hope of the world.Two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people, weakmilitarily, poor economically. But America meant something to the worldthen which could not be measured in dollars, something far more importantthan military might.Listen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not "for ourselvesalone, but for the whole human race."We had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions ofpeople in the world.Today, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let itnot be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made usthe hope of the world at the time of our birth.The demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776.It is no longer enough to live and let live. Now we must live and helplive.We need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathefreely and breathe in freedom.Our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the samething requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.Even more than the programs I have described today, what this Nation needsis an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moralleadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy.Above all, let us inspire young Americans with a sense of excitement, asense of destiny, a sense of involvement, in meeting the challenges we facein this great period of our history. Only then are they going to have anysense of satisfaction in their lives.The greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause biggerthan himself. We have such a cause.How we seize the opportunities I have described today will determine notonly our future, but the future of peace and freedom in this world in thelast third of the century.May God give us the wisdom, the strength and, above all, the idealism to beworthy of that challenge, so that America can fulfill its destiny of beingthe world\'s best hope for liberty, for opportunity, for progress and peacefor all peoples.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, ourdistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:As this 92d Congress begins its session, America has lost a great Senator,and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend. Ihad the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the hospital just a fewdays before he died. He never spoke about himself. He only spoke eloquentlyabout the need for a strong national defense. In tribute to one of the mostmagnificent Americans of all time, I respectfully ask that all those herewill rise in silent prayer for Senator Russell.Thank you.Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal address, I want to use thisopportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the ratherspirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate and,also, to express my condolences to the losers. I know how both of youfeel.And I particularly want to join with all of the Members of the House andthe Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United StatesCongress.To those new Members of this House who may have some doubts about thepossibilities for advancement in the years ahead, I would remind you thatthe Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this Chamber as freshmen Membersof the 80th Congress. As you see, we both have come up in the world a bitsince then.Mr. Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatestCongress in America\'s history.In these troubled years just past, America has been going through a longnightmare of war and division, of crime and inflation. Even more deeply, wehave gone through a long, dark night of the American spirit. But now thatnight is ending. Now we must let our spirits soar again. Now we are readyfor the lift of a driving dream.The people of this Nation are eager to get on with the quest for newgreatness. They see challenges, and they are prepared to meet thosechallenges. It is for us here to open the doors that will set free againthe real greatness of this Nation the genius of the American people.How shall we meet this challenge? How can we truly open the doors, and setfree the full genius of our people?The way in which the 92d Congress answers these questions will determineits place in history. More importantly, it can determine this Nation\'splace in history as we enter the third century of our independence.Tonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals. I shall ask notsimply for more new programs in the old framework. I shall ask to changethe framework of government itself  to reform the entire structure ofAmerican government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needsand the wishes of the American people.If we act boldly if we seize this moment and achieve these goals we canclose the gap between promise and performance in American government. Wecan bring together the resources of this Nation and the spirit of theAmerican people.In discussing these great goals, I shall deal tonight only with matters onthe domestic side of the Nation\'s agenda. I shall make a separate report tothe Congress and the Nation next month on developments in foreign policy.The first of these great goals is already before the Congress.I urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the firstpriority business of the 92d Congress.Over the next 2 weeks, I will call upon Congress to take action on morethan 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completedlast year.The most important is welfare reform.The present welfare system has become a monstrous, consuming outrage anoutrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularlyagainst the children it is supposed to help.We may honestly disagree, as we do, on what to do about it. But we can allagree that we must meet the challenge, not by pouring more money into a badprogram, but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a newone.So let us place a floor under the income of every family with children inAmerica and without those demeaning, soul stifling affronts to humandignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today. But let us alsoestablish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement.Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves. This shall beour goal.Let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves. But letus stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so.The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since1957 full prosperity in peacetime.The tide of inflation has turned. The rise in the cost of living, which hadbeen gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties, was reduced lastyear. Inflation will be further reduced this year.But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable pricestability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartimeeconomy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increasedunemployment.We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment inthis transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in anypeacetime year of the sixties.This is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies. Wemust do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better.To achieve this, I will submit an expansionary budget this year one thatwill help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunitiesfor millions of Americans.It will be a full employment budget, a budget designed to be in balance ifthe economy were operating at its peak potential. By spending as if we wereat full employment, we will help to bring about full employment.I ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies to accept theconcept of a full employment budget. At the same time, I ask the Congressto cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of thefull employment budget. For as we wage a campaign to bring about a widelyshared prosperity, we must not reignite the fires of inflation and soundermine that prosperity.With the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget, with thecommitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide fully forthe monetary needs of a growing economy, and with a much greater effort onthe part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions inthe light of the national interest and their own self interest then forthe worker, the farmer, the consumer, for Americans everywhere we shallgain the goal of a new prosperity: more jobs, more income, more profits,without inflation and without war.This is a great goal, and one that we can achieve together.The third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun lastyear: to restore and enhance our natural environment.Building on the foundation laid in the 37 point program that I submitted toCongress last year, I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to cleanup our air and water, to combat noise, and to preserve and restore oursurroundings.I will propose programs to make better use of our land, to encourage abalanced national growth growth that will revitalize our rural heartlandand enhance the quality of life in America.And not only to meet today\'s needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow, Iwill put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a President ofthe United States to expand the Nation\'s parks, recreation areas, openspaces, in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the peopleare. For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation haveparks to enjoy.As a fourth great goal, I will offer a far reaching set of proposals forimproving America\'s health care and making it available more fairly to morepeople.I will propose: A program to insure that no American family will be prevented fromobtaining basic medical care by inability to pay. I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medicalschools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other healthpersonnel. Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get moremedical care resources into those areas that have not been adequatelyserved, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the alarmingrise in the costs of medical care. New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking thecauses of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors tokeep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch anintensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later forwhatever additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come inAmerica when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom andtook man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.America has long been the wealthiest nation in the world. Now it is time webecame the healthiest nation in the world.The fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our State and localgovernments.As we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976, we remember that this Nationlaunched itself as a loose confederation of separate States, without aworkable central government. At that time, the mark of its leaders\' visionwas that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of theStates with a government of central powers.And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity withdiversity and so clear was their vision that it survives today as theoldest written constitution still in force in the world.For almost two centuries since and dramatically in the 1930\'s at thosegreat turning points when the question has been between the States and theFederal Government, that question has been resolved in favor of a strongercentral Federal Government.During this time the Nation grew and the Nation prospered. But one thinghistory tells us is that no great movement goes in the same directionforever. Nations change, they adapt, or they slowly die.The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resourcesfrom the States and communities to Washington, and start power andresources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities and,more important, to the people all across America.The time has come for a new partnership between the Federal Government andthe States and localities a partnership in which we entrust the States andlocalities with a larger share of the Nation\'s responsibilities, and inwhich we share our Federal revenues with them so that they can meet thoseresponsibilities.To achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact aplan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept.All across America today, States and cities are confronted with a financialcrisis. Some have already been cutting back on essential services  forexample, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trashcollections. Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the onehand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other.As one indication of the rising costs of local government, I discovered theother day that my home town of Whittier, California which has a populationof 67,000 has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire Federal budget wasin 1791.Now the time has come to take a new direction, and once again to introducea new and more creative balance to our approach to government.So let us put the money where the needs are. And let us put the power tospend it where the people are.I propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewingState and local government. Five billion dollars of this will be in new andunrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit. Theother $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new fundsand converting one third of the money going to the present narrow purposeaid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes forurban development, rural development, education, transportation, jobtraining, and law enforcement but with the States and localities makingtheir own decisions on how it should be spent within each category.For the next fiscal year, this would increase total Federal aid to theStates and localities more than 25 percent over the present level.The revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include thesafeguards against discrimination that accompany all other Federal fundsallocated to the States. Neither the President nor the Congress nor theconscience of this Nation can permit money which comes from all the peopleto be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people.The Federal Government will still have a large and vital role to play inachieving our national progress. Established functions that are clearly andessentially Federal in nature will still be performed by the FederalGovernment. New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by theFederal Government such as those I have urged tonight in welfare andhealth will be added to the Federal agenda. Whenever it makes the bestsense for us to act as a whole nation, the Federal Government should andwill lead the way. But where States or local governments can better do whatneeds to be done, let us see that they have the resources to do it there.Under this plan, the Federal Government will provide the States andlocalities with more money and less interference and by cutting down theinterference the same amount of money will go a lot further.Let us share our resources.Let us share them to rescue the States and localities from the brink offinancial crisis.Let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escapefrom ever higher property taxes and sales taxes.Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well.The first of these reasons has to do with government itself, and the secondhas to do with each of us, with the individual.Let\'s face it. Most Americans today are simply fed up with government atall levels. They will not and they should not continue to tolerate thegap between promise and performance in government.The fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it growsmuscle bound and the States and localities so weak they approachimpotence.If we put more power in more places, we can make government more creativein more places. That way we multiply the number of people with the abilityto make things happen and we can open the way to a new burst of creativeenergy throughout America.The final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal, for eachand for every one of us.As everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America, asthe forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and moreimpersonal, a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land.Whether it is the workingman who feels neglected, the black man who feelsoppressed, or the mother concerned about her children, there has been agrowing feeling that "Things are in the saddle, and ride mankind."Millions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out asking notwhat will government do for me, but what can I do, how can I contribute,how can I matter?And so let us answer them. Let us say to them and let us say to allAmericans, "We hear you. We will give you a chance. We are going to giveyou a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect yourfuture a chance to participate in government because we are going toprovide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference thatyou can see and feel in your own life and the life of your wholecommunity."The further away government is from people, the stronger government becomesand the weaker people become. And a nation with a strong government and aweak people is an empty shell.I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., isinevitably more wise, more honest, and more efficient than government atthe local or State level. The honesty and efficiency of government dependson people. Government at all levels has good people and bad people. And theway to get more good people into government is to give them moreopportunity to do good things.The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is bestfor people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is reallya contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves. This notionis completely foreign to the American experience. Local government is thegovernment closest to the people, it is most responsive to the individualperson. It is people\'s government in a far more intimate way than theGovernment in Washington can ever be.People came to America because they wanted to determine their own futurerather than to live in a country where others determined their future forthem.What this change means is that once again in America we are placing ourtrust in people.I have faith in people. I trust the judgment of people. Let us give thepeople of America a chance, a bigger voice in deciding for themselves thosequestions that so greatly affect their lives.The sixth great goal is a complete reform of the Federal Governmentitself.Based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best adviceobtainable, I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of theexecutive branch is needed if the Government is to keep up with the timesand with the needs of the people.I propose, therefore, that we reduce the present 12 Cabinet Departments toeight.I propose that the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, and Justiceremain, but that all the other departments be consolidated into four: HumanResources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and EconomicDevelopment.Let us look at what these would be: First, a department dealing with the concerns of people as individuals,as members of a family a department focused on human needs. Second, a department concerned with the community rural communities andurban communities and with all that it takes to make a community functionas a community. Third, a department concerned with our physical environment, with thepreservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which ourNation depends. And fourth, a department concerned with our prosperity with our jobs,our businesses, and those many activities that keep our economy runningsmoothly and well.Under this plan, rather than dividing up our departments by narrowsubjects, we would organize them around the great purposes of government.Rather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy,we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problemssolved.With these four departments, when we have a problem we will know where togo and the department will have the authority and the resources to dosomething about it.Over the years we have added departments and created agencies at theFederal level, each to serve a new constituency, to handle a particulartask and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopelessconfusion of form and function.The time has come to match our structure to our purposes  to look with afresh eye, to organize the Government by conscious, comprehensive design tomeet the new needs of a new era.One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke ofa "government of the people, by the people, for the people." Too oftensince then, we have become a nation of the Government, by the Government,for the Government.By enacting these reforms, we can renew that principle that Lincoln statedso simply and so well.By giving everyone\'s voice a chance to be heard, we will have governmentthat truly is of the people.By creating more centers of meaningful power, more places where decisionsthat really count can be made, by giving more people a chance to dosomething, we can have government that truly is by the people.And by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government atthe national level, we in Washington will at last be able to providegovernment that is truly for the people.I realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch inWashington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving upsome of its power.Change is hard. But without change there can be no progress. And for eachof us the question then becomes, not "Will change cause me inconvenience?"but "Will change bring progress for America?"Giving up power is hard. But I would urge all of you, as leaders of thiscountry, to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history arethose who gave power to people, and not those who took it away.As we consider these reforms we will be acting, not for the next 2 years orfor the next 10 years, but for the next 100 years.So let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of thismoment in history but also of history itself.Let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and theboldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in Philadelphiaalmost 190 years ago to write a constitution.Let us leave a heritage as they did not just for our children but formillions yet unborn of a nation where every American will have a chancenot only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but toparticipate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes buthis ideas count a system of government which will provide the means forAmerica to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before.Those men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had avision not only of what the Nation was but of what it could become.As I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land ofthe open door as a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a placeof refuge, of hope.When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a halfcenturies ago, they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity andthey left wide the door of welcome for others to follow.When the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence almost two centuriesago, they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of humanfulfillment not just for an elite but for all.To the generations that followed, America\'s was the open door that beckonedmillions from the old world to the new in search of a better life, a freerlife, a fuller life, and in which, by their own decisions, they could shapetheir own destinies.For the black American, the Indian, the Mexican American, and for thoseothers in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last hasbegun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equalopportunity, and of human dignity.For all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can openthe door to a new era of opportunity. We can open the door to full andeffective participation in the decisions that affect their lives. We canopen the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels, betweenthose governments and the people themselves. And by so doing, we can openwide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in Americanow and in the years to come.In the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I proposethat we achieve these six great goals. I ask this Congress to beresponsive. If it is, then the 92d Congress, your Congress, our Congress,at the end of its term, will be able to look back on a record more splendidthan any in our history.This can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the Nation\'shistory, and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance toenjoy what we have not had in this century: a full generation of peace.This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, withfull employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus ofwar.This can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbedrecipients of their dignity and robbed States and cities of theirresources.This can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of ourenvironment, and established for the next generation an enduring legacy ofparks for the people.This can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine, inwhich the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were madeless burdensome.But above all, what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the wayto a new American revolution a peaceful revolution in which power wasturned back to the people in which government at all levels was refreshedand renewed and made truly responsive. This can be a revolution asprofound, as far reaching, as exciting as that first revolution almost 200years ago and it can mean that just 5 years from now America will enterits third century as a young nation new in spirit, with all the vigor andthe freshness with which it began its first century.My colleagues in the Congress, these are great goals. They can make thesessions of this Congress a great moment for America. So let us pledgetogether to go forward together by achieving these goals to give Americathe foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years tocome, and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the history ofthis great and good country.
Richard Nixon
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, ourdistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:Twenty five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman along withSpeaker Albert and listened for the first time to the President addressthe State of the Union.I shall never forget that moment. The Senate, the diplomatic corps, theSupreme Court, the Cabinet entered the Chamber, and then the President ofthe United States. As all of you are aware, I had some differences withPresident Truman. He had some with me. But I remember that on that day theday he addressed that joint session of the newly elected Republican 80thCongress, he spoke not as a partisan, but as President of all thepeople calling upon the Congress to put aside partisan considerations inthe national interest.The Greek Turkish aid program, the Marshall Plan, the great foreign policyinitiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over25 years were approved by the 80th Congress, by a bipartisan majority ofwhich I was proud to be a part.Nineteen hundred seventy two is now before us. It holds precious time inwhich to accomplish good for the Nation. We must not waste it. I know thepolitical pressures in this session of the Congress will be great. Thereare more candidates for the Presidency in this Chamber today than thereprobably have been at any one time in the whole history of the Republic.And there is an honest difference of opinion, not only between the parties,but within each party, on some foreign policy issues and on some domesticpolicy issues.However, there are great national problems that are so vital that theytranscend partisanship. So let us have our debates. Let us have our honestdifferences. But let us join in keeping the national interest first. Let usjoin in making sure that legislation the Nation needs does not becomehostage to the political interests of any party or any person.There is ample precedent, in this election year, for me to present you witha huge list of new proposals, knowing full well that there would not be anypossibility of your passing them if you worked night and day.I shall not do that.I have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of 15,000words discussing in some detail where the Nation stands and setting forthspecific legislative items on which I have asked the Congress to act. Muchof this is legislation which I proposed in 1969, in 1970, and also in thefirst session of this 92d Congress and on which I feel it is essential thataction be completed this year.I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope ofpassage. I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacityof this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to finance,and which I believe should be above partisanship programs which deal withurgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must be the subject ofbipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in1972.When I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 yearsago today, the Nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in itshistory.The 1960\'s were a time of great progress in many areas. But as we all know,they were also times of great agony the agonies of war, of inflation, ofrapidly rising crime, of deteriorating titles, of hopes raised anddisappointed, and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence andto the worst civil disorder in a century.I recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame. The Nation wasso torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both partiesquestioned whether America could be governed at all.The Nation has made significant progress in these first years of theseventies:Our cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders.Our colleges and universities have again become places of learning insteadof battlegrounds.A beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment.The rate of increase in crime has been slowed and here in the District ofColumbia, the one city where the Federal Government has directjurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent fromthe year before.Most important, because of the beginnings that have been made, we can saytoday that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make thegreatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peacewith all the nations of the world.As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go onto build a generation of peace.To achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to maintainour defense.In the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms. For the first timein 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on humanresources.As we look to the future, we find encouraging progress in our negotiationswith the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms. And looking furtherinto the future, we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutualreduction of arms. But until there is such a mutual agreement, we mustmaintain the strength necessary to deter war.And that is why, because of rising research and development costs, becauseof increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need to proceedwith new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal year will providefor an increase in defense spending.Strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace; they are the guardiansof peace.There could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which wouldtempt others by weakening America, and thereby endanger the peace of theworld.In our foreign policy, we have entered a new era. The world has changedgreatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his InauguralAddress, "... we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the successof liberty."Our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the newrealities of the new world we live in. We make today only those commitmentswe are able and prepared to meet.Our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable. But others mustbear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world.And so this, then, is our policy: We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to thesecurity of the United States or of our allies. We will help other nations develop the capability of defendingthemselves. We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments. We will act to defend our interests, whenever and wherever they arethreatened anyplace in the world. But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved, ourrole will be limited. We will not intervene militarily. But we will use our influence to prevent war. If war comes, we will use our influence to stop it. Once it is over, we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds ofthose who have participated in it.As you know, I will soon be visiting the People\'s Republic of China and theSoviet Union. I go there with no illusions. We have great differences withboth powers. We shall continue to have great differences. But peace dependson the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despitetheir differences.We would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if wefailed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that wewill be able to talk about those differences, rather than to fight aboutthem, in the future.As we look back over this century, let us, in the highest spirit ofbipartisanship, recognize that we can be proud of our Nation\'s record inforeign affairs.America has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom,preserving peace, alleviating human suffering around the globe, than anynation has ever done in the history of man.We have fought four wars in this century, but our power has never been usedto break the peace, only to keep it; never been used to destroy freedom,only to defend it. We now have within our reach the goal of insuring thatthe next generation can be the first generation in this century to bespared the scourges of war.Turning to our problems at home, we are making progress toward our goal ofa new prosperity without war.Industrial production, consumer spending, retail sales, personal income allhave been rising. Total employment, real income are the highest in history.New home building starts this past year reached the highest level ever.Business and consumer confidence have both been rising. Interest rates aredown. The rate of inflation is down. We can look with confidence to 1972 asthe year when the back of inflation will be broken.Now, this a good record, but it is not good enough not when we still havean unemployment rate of 6 percent.It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetimeyears of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men released fromthe Armed Forces and defense related industries were still in their wartimejobs, unemployment would be far lower.Our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime. We intend to meetthat goal, and we can.The Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job creating taxprogram last month.The historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with themajor European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by providingnew markets for American products, new jobs for American workers.Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without beinginflationary a job producing budget that will help take up the gap as theeconomy expands to full employment.Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalizerural America, by giving to America\'s farmers their fair share of America\'sincreasing productivity.We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a setof major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America\'s greatcapacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward improving thequality of life for every American.In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology iscapable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberatelytoward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing thewonders of science to the service of man.I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new programof Federal partnership in technological research and development withFederal incentives to increase private research, federally supportedresearch on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways thatwill range from improving mass transit to developing new systems ofemergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually.Historically, our superior technology and high productivity have made itpossible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by far,and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets.Now we face a new situation. As other nations move rapidly forward intechnology, the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall aroundAmerica, but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technologystill further and by increasing productivity in American industry.Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for Americangoods to compete fairly in the world\'s markets but they still mustcompete. The new technology program will put to use the skills of manyhighly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted. It willalso meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will thushelp to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for America\'sworkers in producing for the world\'s markets.This second session of the 92d Congress already has before it more than 90major Administration proposals which still await action.I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I havepresented to the Congress today.They include, among others, our programs to improve life for the aging; tocombat crime and drug abuse; to improve health services and to ensure thatno one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay; toprotect workers\' pension rights; to promote equal opportunity for membersof minorities, and others who have been left behind; to expand consumerprotection; to improve the environment; to revitalize rural America; tohelp the cities; to launch new initiatives in education; to improvetransportation, and to put an end to costly labor tie ups intransportation.The west coast dock strike is a case in point. This Nation cannot and willnot tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie up in the future.The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if ourstructure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfaresystem substitution of a new system that provides work requirements andwork incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for thosewho cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor.They include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with theStates and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment alsoof faith in the American people.They also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of theFederal Government so that it will be more efficient, more responsive, andable to meet the challenges of the decades ahead.One year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session ofthis Congress six great goals. One of these was welfare reform. Thatproposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.My proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care,and the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year.Many of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been herethat long or longer.Now, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures. Nowlet us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by theCongress, for the Nation and for the people of America.Now, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previouslycovered, but which must be placed on the national agenda.We long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the mainsource of financing for public primary and secondary education.As a result, soaring school costs, soaring property tax rates now threatenboth our communities and our schools. They threaten communities becauseproperty taxes, which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to \'70,have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes,hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired; and they threatenschools, as hard pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues atthe polls.The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent courtdecisions, which have held that the conventional method of financingschools through local property taxes is discriminatory andunconstitutional.Nearly 2 years ago, I named a special Presidential commission to study theproblems of school finance, and I also directed the Federal departments tolook into the same problems. We are developing comprehensive proposals tomeet these problems.This issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems: supportof the schools and the basic relationships of Federal, State, and localgovernments in any tax reforms.Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, we are carefullyreviewing all of the tax aspects, and I have this week enlisted theAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing theintergovernmental relations aspects.I have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for Federalaction to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and propertytaxes. Later in the year, when both Commissions have completed theirstudies, I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden ofproperty taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for ourchildren\'s education.These recommendations will be revolutionary. But all these recommendations,however, will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there canbe no compromise: Local school boards must have control over localschools.As we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change arenot only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world, andparticularly of our life in America.Surveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen ridercaught in the stirrups or we can sit high in the saddle, the masters ofchange, directing it on a course we choose.The secret of mastering change in today\'s world is to reach back to old andproven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence tothe new realities of a new age.That is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before theCongress. They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as humannature, as robust as the American experience; and they are responsive tonew conditions. Thus they represent a spirit of change that is trulyrenewal.As we look back at those old principles, we find them as timely as they aretimeless.We believe in independence, and self reliance, and the creative value ofthe competitive spirit.We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in theprotection of individual rights and liberties.We believe in the family as the keystone of the community, and in thecommunity as the keystone of the Nation.We believe in compassion toward those in need.We believe in a system of law, justice, and order as the basis of agenuinely free society.We believe that a person should get what he works for and that those whocan, should work for what they get.We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in theirown lives, in their own communities and we believe in their right to makethose decisions.In applying these principles, we have done so with the full understandingthat what we seek in the seventies, what our quest is, is not merely formore, but for better for a better quality of life for all Americans.Thus, for example, we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning upour air and water, making our surroundings more attractive. We areproviding broader support for the arts, helping stimulate a deeperappreciation of what they can contribute to the Nation\'s activities and toour individual lives.But nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way wetreat one another, than our capacity to live respectfully together as aunified society, with a full, generous regard for the rights of others andalso for the feelings of others.As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learnonce again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another, weare regaining that capacity.As is customary here, on this occasion, I have been talking about programs.Programs are important. But even more important than programs is what weare as a Nation what we mean as a Nation, to ourselves and to the world.In New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world theStatue of Liberty, the gift in 1886 of the people of France to the peopleof the United States. This statue is more than a landmark; it is asymbol a symbol of what America has meant to the world.It reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth, and not itspower, but its spirit and purpose a land that enshrines liberty andopportunity, and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in searchof a better and a fuller and, above all, a freer life.The world\'s hopes poured into America, along with its people. And thosehopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of theworld, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world.Four years from now, America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of itsfounding as a Nation. There are those who say that the old Spirit of \'76 isdead that we no longer have the strength of character, the idealism, thefaith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents.Those who say this do not know America.We have been undergoing self doubts and self criticism. But these are onlythe other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in themidst of plenty, of our impatience with the slowness with which age oldills are being overcome.If we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society, or complacentabout our institutions, or blind to the lingering inequities then we wouldhave lost our way.But the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals, deepdown, are still strong. Indeed, they remind us that what is really bestabout America is its compassion. They remind us that in the final analysis,America is great not because it is strong, not because it is rich, butbecause this is a good country.Let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we areevil because we are not yet perfect, that we are corrupt because we are notyet pure, that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone into thebuilding of America were for naught because the building is not yet done.Let us see that the path we are traveling is wide, with room in it for allof us, and that its direction is toward a better Nation and a more peacefulworld.Never has it mattered more that we go forward together.Look at this Chamber. The leadership of America is here today the SupremeCourt, the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives.Together, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of theNation in our hands.Because this year is an election year, it will be a time of greatpressure.If we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historicchallenges that we face, we will have failed the trust of millions ofAmericans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us, intheir Government.Never has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of aprofound and constructive reform for the Nation than this Congress.If we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all not onlyfor doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising abovepartisan interest to serve the national interest.And if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser.That is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship, sothat in the years to come Americans will look back and say because itwithstood the intense pressures of a political year, and achieved suchgreat good for the American people and for the future of this Nation, thiswas truly a great Congress.
Richard Nixon
To the Congress of the United States:The traditional form of the President\'s annual report giving "to theCongress Information of the State of the Union" is a single message oraddress. As the affairs and concerns of our Union have multiplied over theyears, however, so too have the subjects that require discussion in Stateof the Union Messages.This year in particular, with so many changes in Government programs underconsideration and with our very philosophy about the relationship betweenthe individual and the State at an historic crossroads a single,all embracing State of the Union Message would not appear to be adequate.I have therefore decided to present my 1973 State of the Union report inthe form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rdCongress. The purpose of this first message in the series is to give aconcise overview of where we stand as a people today, and to outline someof the general goals that I believe we should pursue over the next year andbeyond. In coming weeks, I will send to the Congress further State of theUnion reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs,natural resources, human resources, community development and foreign anddefense policy.The new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach toGovernment: an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s, notthose of the 1930s or of the 1960s. The role of the Federal Government aswe approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate anyfacet of American life, but rather to aid and encourage people, communitiesand institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challengesfacing them as possible, and to help see to it that every American has afull and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential.If we were to continue to expand the Federal Government at the rate of thepast several decades, it soon would consume us entirely. The time has comewhen we must make clear choices choices between old programs that setworthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide abetter way to realize those goals; and choices, too, between competingprograms all of which may be desirable in themselves but only some ofwhich we can afford with the finite resources at our command.Because our resources are not infinite, we also face a critical choice in1973 between holding the line in Government spending and adopting expensiveprograms which will surely force up taxes and refuel inflation.Finally, it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense ofresponsibility at the State and local level, and among individualAmericans.WHERE WE STANDThe basic state of our Union today is sound, and full of promise.We enter 1973 economically strong, militarily secure and, most important ofall, at peace after a long and trying war.America continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more ofits people than any other nation in the world. We have passed through oneof the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering todespair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people.Looking back, there is a lesson in all this for all of us. The lesson isone that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years.But we did learn it. That lesson is that even potentially destructiveforces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channelthem, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climateof mutual respect and goodwill.By working together and harnessing the forces of nature, Americans haveunlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe.Men have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights ofdiscovery.This same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease andsuffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time.By working together with the leaders of other nations, we have been able tobuild a new hope for lasting peace for a structure of world order in whichcommon interest outweighs old animosities, and in which a new generation ofthe human family can grow up at peace in a changing world.At home, we have learned that by working together we can create prosperitywithout fanning inflation; we can restore order without weakening freedom.THE CHALLENGES WE FACEThese first years of the 1970s have been good years for America.Our job all of us together is to make 1973 and the years to come evenbetter ones. I believe that we can. I believe that we can make the yearsleading to our Bicentennial the best four years in American history.But we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved withoutthe will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice.Hard decisions must be made, and we must stick by them.In the field of foreign policy, we must remember that a strong America anAmerica whose word is believed and whose strength is respected isessential to continued peace and understanding in the world. The peace withhonor we have achieved in Vietnam has strengthened this basic Americancredibility. We must act in such a way in coming years that thiscredibility will remain intact, and with it, the world stability of whichit is so indispensable a part.At home, we must reject the mistaken notion a notion that has dominatedtoo much of the public dialogue for too long that ever bigger Governmentis the answer to every problem.We have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive Governmentspending are not a cure all. In too many cases, instead of solving theproblems they were aimed at, they have merely placed an ever heavier burdenon the shoulders of the American taxpayer, in the form of higher taxes anda higher cost of living. At the same time they have deceived our peoplebecause many of the intended beneficiaries received far less than waspromised, thus undermining public faith in the effectiveness of Governmentas a whole.The time has come for us to draw the line. The time has come for theresponsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand againstovergrown Government and for the American taxpayer. We are not spending theFederal Government\'s money, we are spending the taxpayer\'s money, and itmust be spent in a way which guarantees his money\'s worth and yields thefullest possible benefit to the people being helped.The answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes andmore spending. It is less waste, more results and greater freedom for theindividual American to earn a rightful place in his own community and forStates and localities to address their own needs in their own ways, in thelight of their own priorities.By giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voicethrough changes such as revenue sharing, and by saying "no" to excessiveFederal spending and higher taxes, we can help achieve this goal.COMING MESSAGESThe policies which I will outline to the Congress in the weeks aheadrepresent a reaffirmation, not an abdication, of Federal responsibility.They represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and nationalexcellence, in place of the combination of good intentions and fuzzyfollow through which too often in the past was thought sufficient.In the field of economic affairs, our objectives will be to hold downtaxes, to continue controlling inflation, to promote economic growth, toincrease productivity, to encourage foreign trade, to keep farm incomehigh, to bolster small business, and to promote better labor managementrelations.In the area of natural resources, my recommendations will include programsto preserve and enhance the environment, to advance science and technology,and to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural resources.In developing human resources, I will have recommendations to advance theNation\'s health and education, to improve conditions of people in need, tocarry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime, drug abuse andinjustice, and to deal with such important areas of special concern asconsumer affairs. We will continue and improve our Nation\'s efforts toassist those who have served in the Armed Services in Vietnam throughbetter job and training opportunities.We must do a better job in community development in creating more livablecommunities, in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access toopportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which nowplague so many of our towns and cities. I shall have proposals to help usachieve this.I shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies, and with our newapproaches to the role and structure of Government itself.Considered as a whole, this series of messages will be a blueprint formodernizing the concept and the functions of American Government to meetthe needs of our people.Converting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and sharedcommitment on the part of all branches of the Government, for the goals weseek are not those of any single party or faction, they are goals for thebetterment of all Americans. As President, I recognize that I cannot dothis job alone. The Congress must help, and I pledge to do my part toachieve a constructive working relationship with the Congress. My sincerehope is that the executive and legislative branches can work together inthis great undertaking in a positive spirit of mutual respect andcooperation.Working together the Congress, the President and the people I amconfident that we can translate these proposals into an action program thatcan reform and revitalize American Government and, even more important,build a better life for all Americans.The White House,February 2, 1973.
Richard Nixon
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, ourdistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:We meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunitiesfor America. We meet at a time when we face great problems at home andabroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation. But we alsomeet at a time when that fiber has been tested, and it has proved strong.America is a great and good land, and we are a great and good land becausewe are a strong, free, creative people and because America is the singlegreatest force for peace anywhere in the world. Today, as always in ourhistory, we can base our confidence in what the American people willachieve in the future on the record of what the American people haveachieved in the past.Tonight, for the first time in 12 years, a President of the United Statescan report to the Congress on the state of a Union at peace with everynation of the world. Because of this, in the 22,000 word message on thestate of the Union that I have just handed to the Speaker of the House andthe President of the Senate, I have been able to deal primarily with theproblems of peace with what we can do here at home in America for theAmerican people rather than with the problems of war.The measures I have outlined in this message set an agenda for trulysignificant progress for this Nation and the world in 1974. Before we chartwhere we are going, let us see how far we have come.It was 5 years ago on the steps of this Capitol that I took the oath ofoffice as your President. In those 5 years, because of the initiativesundertaken by this Administration, the world has changed. America haschanged. As a result of those changes, America is safer today, moreprosperous today, with greater opportunity for more of its people than everbefore in our history.Five years ago, America was at war in Southeast Asia. We were locked inconfrontation with the Soviet Union. We were in hostile isolation from aquarter of the world\'s people who lived in Mainland China.Five years ago, our cities were burning and besieged.Five years ago, our college campuses were a battleground.Five years ago, crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across theNation.Five years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening humanand social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program to dealwith it.Five years ago as young Americans had done for a generation beforethat America\'s youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft.Five years ago, there was no national program to preserve our environment.Day by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was getting more foul.And 5 years ago, American agriculture was practically a depressed industrywith 100,000 farm families abandoning the farm every year.As we look at America today, we find ourselves challenged by new problems.But we also find a record of progress to confound the professional criersof doom and prophets of despair. We met the challenges we faced 5 yearsago, and we will be equally confident of meeting those that we face today.Let us see for a moment how we have met them.After more than 10 years of military involvement, all of our troops havereturned from Southeast Asia, and they have returned with honor. And we canbe proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war, for whom adinner was held in Washington tonight, that they came home with their headshigh, on their feet and not on their knees.In our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a policyof confrontation to one of negotiation. For the first time since World WarII, the world\'s two strongest powers are working together toward peace inthe world. With the People\'s Republic of China after a generation ofhostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful exchange andexpanding trade.Peace has returned to our cities, to our campuses. The 17 year rise incrime has been stopped. We can confidently say today that we are finallybeginning to win the war against crime. Right here in this Nation\'sCapital which a few years ago was threatening to become the crime capitalof the world the rate in crime has been cut in half. A massive campaignagainst drug abuse has been organized. And the rate of new heroinaddiction, the most vicious threat of all, is decreasing rather thanincreasing.For the first time in a generation, no young Americans are being draftedinto the armed services of the United States. And for the first time ever,we have organized a massive national effort to protect the environment. Ourair is getting cleaner, our water is getting purer, and our agriculture,which was depressed, is prospering. Farm income is up 70 percent, farmproduction is setting all time records, and the billions of dollars thetaxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut to nearly zero.Overall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today. Morethan 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone. That isthe biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years. People are earningmore. What they earn buys more, more than ever before in history. In thepast 5 years, the average American\'s real spendable income that is, whatyou really can buy with your income, even after allowing for taxes andinflation has increased by 16 percent.Despite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hearonce again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling usnow that because of the need to fight inflation, because of the energyshortage, America may be headed for a recession.Let me speak to that issue head on. There will be no recession in theUnited States of America. Primarily due to our energy crisis, our economyis passing through a difficult period. But I pledge to you tonight that thefull powers of this Government will be used to keep America\'s economyproducing and to protect the jobs of America\'s workers.We are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation. There have been,and there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight. But if thisCongress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of Government, weshall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the Americanpeople.As we look back over our history, the years that stand out as the ones ofsignal achievement are those in which the Administration and the Congress,whether one party or the other, working together, had the wisdom and theforesight to select those particular initiatives for which the Nation wasready and the moment was right and in which they seized the moment andacted.Looking at the year 1974 which lies before us, there are 10 key areas inwhich landmark accomplishments are possible this year in America. If wemake these our national agenda, this is what we will achieve in 1974:We will break the back of the energy crisis; we will lay the foundation forour future capacity to meet America\'s energy needs from America\'s ownresources.And we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in theworld not only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather thanconfrontation where the great powers are concerned but also by helpingtoward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the MiddleEast.We will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicineof recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period of growthat a sustainable level.We will establish a new system that makes high quality health careavailable to every American in a dignified manner and at a price he canafford.We will make our States and localities more responsive to the needs oftheir own citizens.We will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in ourtowns and in our cities across America.We will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it whenit is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for those whoneed it the most.We will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and protectingthe right of personal privacy for every American.And we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system thatbleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, and demeans those it isintended to assist.And together with the other nations of the world, we will establish theeconomic framework within which Americans will share more fully in anexpanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead, with more openaccess to both markets and supplies.In all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place, inour history this is the first in which the one priority, the firstpriority, is energy. Let me begin by reporting a new development which Iknow will be welcome news to every American. As you know, we have committedourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peacein the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of Security CouncilResolutions 242 and 338. The first step in the process is the disengagementof Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking place.Because of this hopeful development, I can announce tonight that I havebeen assured, through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in theMiddle Eastern area, that an urgent meeting will be called in the immediatefuture to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo.This is an encouraging sign. However, it should be clearly understood byour friends in the Middle East that the United States will not be coercedon this issue.Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the Americanpeople in our energy conservation program has already gone a long waytowards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated. Let us doeverything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States ofAmerica.Last week, I sent to the Congress a comprehensive special message settingforth our energy situation, recommending the legislative measures which arenecessary to a program for meeting our needs. If the embargo is lifted,this will ease the crisis, but it will not mean an end to the energyshortage in America. Voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary.And let me take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendidspirit of cooperation the American people have shown which has madepossible our success in meeting this emergency up to this time.The new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary. Therefore,I urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be made thefirst priority of this session of the Congress. These measures will requirethe oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with thenecessary information on their supplies. They will prevent the injustice ofwindfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions ofAmericans. And they will give us the organization, the incentives, theauthorities needed to deal with the short term emergency and to move towardmeeting our long term needs.Just as 1970 was the year in which we began a full scale effort to protectthe environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full scaleeffort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this decade but throughthe 21st century.As we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversaryof this Nation\'s independence, let us press vigorously on toward the goal Iannounced last November for Project Independence. Let this be our nationalgoal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States willnot be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide ourjobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving.To indicate the size of the Government commitment, to spur energy researchand development, we plan to spend $10 billion in Federal funds over thenext 5 years. That is an enormous amount. But during the same 5 years,private enterprise will be investing as much as $200 billion and in 10years, $500 billion to develop the new resources, the new technology, thenew capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980\'s. Thatis just a measure of the magnitude of the project we are undertaking.But America performs best when called to its biggest tasks. It can truly besaid that only in America could a task so tremendous be achieved soquickly, and achieved not by regimentation, but through the effort andingenuity of a free people, working in a free system.Turning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974, the time is at hand thisyear to bring comprehensive, high quality health care within the reach ofevery American. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assurecomprehensive health insurance protection to millions of Americans whocannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection againstcatastrophic illnesses. This will be a plan that maintains the highstandards of quality in America\'s health care. And it will not requireadditional taxes.Now, I recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost $80billion or even $100 billion and that would put our whole health caresystem under the heavy hand of the Federal Government. This is the wrongapproach. This has been tried abroad, and it has failed. It is not the waywe do things here in America. This kind of plan would threaten the qualityof care provided by our whole health care system. The right way is one thatbuilds on the strengths of the present system and one that does not destroythose strengths, one based on partnership, not paternalism. Most importantof all, let us keep this as the guiding principle of our health programs.Government has a great role to play, but we must always make sure that ourdoctors will be working for their patients and not for the FederalGovernment.Many of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years ago,I commented that "Most Americans today are simply fed up with government atall levels," and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalizeState and local governments, to make them more responsive to the peoplethey serve. I can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharingpassed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made progress towardthat goal. After 40 years of moving power from the States and thecommunities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving power back fromWashington to the States and communities and, most important, to the peopleof America.In this session of the Congress, I believe we are near the breakthroughpoint on efforts which I have suggested, proposals to let people themselvesmake their own decisions for their own communities and, in particular, onthose to provide broad new flexibility in Federal aid for communitydevelopment, for economic development, for education. And I look forward toworking with the Congress, with members of both parties in resolvingwhatever remaining differences we have in this legislation so that we canmake available nearly $5 1/2 billion to our States and localities to usenot for what a Federal bureaucrat may want, but for what their own peoplein those communities want. The decision should be theirs.I think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency tothe need to improve public transportation, not only in our cities but inrural areas as well. The program I have proposed this year will givecommunities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their owntransportation needs. It will mark the strongest Federal commitment ever tothe improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvementof life in our towns and cities.One goal on which all Americans agree is that our children should have thevery best education this great Nation can provide.In a special message last week, I recommended a number of important newmeasures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for ourschools and for the children they serve. If the Congress will act on theseproposals, more flexible funding will enable each Federal dollar to meetbetter the particular need of each particular school district. Advancefunding will give school authorities a chance to make each year\'s plans,knowing ahead of time what Federal funds they are going to receive. Specialtargeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among ourpeople. College students faced with rising costs for their education willbe able to draw on an expanded program of loans and grants. These advancesare a needed investment in America\'s most precious resource, our nextgeneration. And I urge the Congress to act on this legislation in 1974.One measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects theliberties of its individual citizens. As technology has advanced inAmerica, it has increasingly encroached on one of those liberties what Iterm the right of personal privacy. Modern information systems, data banks,credit records, mailing list abuses, electronic snooping, the collection ofpersonal data for one purpose that may be used for another all these haveleft millions of Americans deeply concerned by the privacy they cherish.And the time has come, therefore, for a major initiative to define thenature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect newsafeguards to ensure that those rights are respected.I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of theAdministration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress inestablishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs ofsociety, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principleof American liberty.Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years agothat I termed the Nation\'s welfare system "a monstrous, consumingoutrage an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, andparticularly against the children that it is supposed to help."That system is still an outrage. By improving its administration, we havebeen able to reduce some of the abuses. As a result, last year, for thefirst time in 18 years, there has been a halt in the growth of the welfarecaseload. But as a system, our welfare program still needs reform asurgently today as it did when I first proposed in 1969 that we completelyreplace it with a different system.In these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the Congress to join mein mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfaresystem with one that works, one that is fair to those who need help orcannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the taxpayer.And let us have as our goal that there will be no Government program whichmakes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.I recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the Congressover the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect enactmentovernight of a new reform. But I do propose that the Congress and theAdministration together make this the year in which we discuss, debate, andshape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible.America\'s own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fullyand equitably in an expanding world prosperity. Historic negotiations willtake place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment ininternational markets for American workers, American farmers, Americaninvestors, and American consumers.It is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill I submitted tothe Congress be enacted so that the United States can negotiate flexiblyand vigorously on behalf of American interests. These negotiations canusher in a new era of international trade that not only increases theprosperity of all nations but also strengthens the peace among allnations.In the past 5 years, we have made more progress toward a lasting structureof peace in the world than in any comparable time in the Nation\'s history.We could not have made that progress if we had not maintained the militarystrength of America. Thomas Jefferson once observed that the price ofliberty is eternal vigilance. By the same token, and for the same reason,in today\'s world the price of peace is a strong defense as far as theUnited States is concerned.In the past 5 years, we have steadily reduced the burden of nationaldefense as a share of the budget, bringing it down from 44 percent in 1969to 29 percent in the current year. We have cut our military manpower overthe past 5 years by more than a third, from 3.5 million to 2.2 million.In the coming year, however, increased expenditures will be needed. Theywill be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces, topreserve present force levels in the face of rising costs, and to give usthe military strength we must have if our security is to be maintained andif our initiatives for peace are to succeed.The question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessarystrength of our defense, the question is whether we can afford not tomaintain it, and the answer to that question is no. We must never allowAmerica to become the second strongest nation in the world.I do not say this with any sense of belligerence, because I recognize thefact that is recognized around the world. America\'s military strength hasalways been maintained to keep the peace, never to break it. It has alwaysbeen used to defend freedom, never to destroy it. The world\'s peace, aswell as our own, depends on our remaining as strong as we need to be aslong as we need to be.In this year 1974, we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to placefurther limits on strategic nuclear arms. Together with our allies, we willbe negotiating with the nations of the Warsaw Pact on mutual and balancedreduction of forces in Europe. And we will continue our efforts to promotepeaceful economic development in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia. We willpress for full compliance with the peace accords that brought an end toAmerican fighting in Indochina, including particularly a provision thatpromised the fullest possible accounting for those Americans who aremissing in action.And having in mind the energy crisis to which I have referred to earlier,we will be working with the other nations of the world toward agreement onmeans by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable prices on a stablebasis in a fair way to the consuming and producing nations alike.All of these are steps toward a future in which the world\'s peace andprosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure.Throughout the 5 years that I have served as your President, I have had oneoverriding aim, and that was to establish a new structure of peace in theworld that can free future generations of the scourge of war. I canunderstand that others may have different priorities. This has been andthis will remain my first priority and the chief legacy I hope to leavefrom the 8 years of my Presidency.This does not mean that we shall not have other priorities, because as westrengthen the peace, we must also continue each year a steadystrengthening of our society here at home. Our conscience requires it, ourinterests require it, and we must insist upon it.As we create more jobs, as we build a better health care system, as weimprove our education, as we develop new sources of energy, as we providemore abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen the systemof private enterprise that produces our prosperity as we do all of thisand even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together asa nation.Even more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government inAmerica is all about.What it is all about is more freedom, more security, a better life for eachone of the 211 million people that live in this land.We cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace abroad.But neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing progressat home. With a stable peace, all is possible, but without peace, nothingis possible.In the written message that I have just delivered to the Speaker and to thePresident of the Senate, I commented that one of the continuing challengesfacing us in the legislative process is that of the timing and pacing ofour initiatives, selecting each year among many worthy projects those thatare ripe for action at that time.What is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in theworld. This period we now are in, in the world and I say this as one whohas seen so much of the world, not only in these past 5 years but goingback over many years we are in a period which presents a juncture ofhistoric forces unique in this century. They provide an opportunity we maynever have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last alifetime and more, not just peace in our time but peace in our children\'stime as well. It is on the way we respond to this opportunity, more thananything else, that history will judge whether we in America have met ourresponsibility. And I am confident we will meet that great historicresponsibility which is ours today.It was 27 years ago that John F. Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, asfreshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union addressdelivered by Harry Truman. I know from my talks with him, as members of theLabor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then evendreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this placethat I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me. It may wellbe that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one of you outthere, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27 years from now,in the year 2001.Well, whichever one it is, I want you to be able to look back with prideand to say that your first years here were great years and recall that youwere here in this 93d Congress when America ended its longest war and beganits longest peace.Mr. Speaker, and Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues and ourguests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue thathas been of great concern to all Americans over the past year. I refer, ofcourse, to the investigations of the so called Watergate affair. As youknow, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great deal ofmaterial. I believe that I have provided all the material that he needs toconclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and toclear the innocent.I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the otherinvestigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough.And the time has come, my colleagues, for not only the Executive, thePresident, but the Members of Congress, for all of us to join together indevoting our full energies to these great issues that I have discussedtonight which involve the welfare of all of the American people in so manydifferent ways, as well as the peace of the world.I recognize that the House Judiciary Committee has a special responsibilityin this area, and I want to indicate on this occasion that I will cooperatewith the Judiciary Committee in its investigation. I will cooperate so thatit can conclude its investigation, make its decision, and I will cooperatein any way that I consider consistent with my responsibilities to theOffice of the Presidency of the United States.There is only one limitation. I will follow the precedent that has beenfollowed by and defended by every President from George Washington toLyndon B. Johnson of never doing anything that weakens the Office of thePresident of the United States or impairs the ability of the Presidents ofthe future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this Nationand the world.Another point I should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of theHouse and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office that Ihold. And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was elected tothat office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of doing a job anddoing it as well as I possibly can. And I want you to know that I have nointention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the peopleelected me to do for the people of the United States.Now, needless to say, it would be understatement if I were not to admitthat the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for myfamily. And as I have already indicated, the year 1974 presents very greatand serious problems, as very great and serious opportunities are alsopresented.But my colleagues, this I believe: With the help of God, who has blessedthis land so richly, with the cooperation of the Congress, and with thesupport of the American people, we can and we will make the year 1974 ayear of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure oflasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the UnitedStates of America.
Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:Today marks my first State of the Union address to you, a constitutionalduty as old as our Republic itself.President Washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding theNation that the destiny of self government and the "preservation of thesacred fire of liberty" is "finally staked on the experiment entrusted tothe hands of the American people." For our friends in the press, who placea high premium on accuracy, let me say: I did not actually hear GeorgeWashington say that. But it is a matter of historic record.But from this podium, Winston Churchill asked the free world to standtogether against the onslaught of aggression. Franklin Delano Rooseveltspoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms. Douglas MacArthurmade an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well.Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price ofstrength. And John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that isfreedom.When I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington, criticalof past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new spirit ofpartnership between this Congress and this administration and betweenWashington and our State and local governments. In forging this newpartnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of ourRepublic prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessingsof individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all of humanity.It\'s my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made inour relations with other nations, on the foundation we\'ve carefully laidfor our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited initiativethat I believe can change the face of American government and make it againthe servant of the people.Seldom have the stakes been higher for America. What we do and say herewill make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in theNorthwest, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines;to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard pressed farmers and smallbusinessmen; and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simplewish of a safe and financially secure future for their children. Tounderstand the state of the Union, we must look not only at where we areand where we\'re going but where we\'ve been. The situation at this time lastyear was truly ominous.The last decade has seen a series of recessions. There was a recession in1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980. Each time, unemploymentincreased and inflation soon turned up again. We coined the word"stagflation" to describe this.Government\'s response to these recessions was to pump up the money supplyand increase spending. In the last 6 months of 1980, as an example, themoney supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history 13 percent.Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased atan annual rate of 17 percent. Interest rates reached a staggering 21.5percent. There were 8 million unemployed.Late in 1981 we sank into the present recession, largely because continuedhigh interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction. And there wasa drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment increased.This time, however, things are different. We have an economic program inplace, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past. Itcalls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, andalready that rate has been cut nearly in half. But reduced spending thefirst and smallest phase of a 3 year tax rate reduction designed tostimulate the economy and create jobs. Already interest rates are down to15 3/4 percent, but they must still go lower. Inflation is down from 12.4percent to 8.9, and for the month of December it was running at anannualized rate of 5.2 percent. If we had not acted as we did, things wouldbe far worse for all Americans than they are today. Inflation, taxes, andinterest rates would all be higher.A year ago, Americans\' faith in their governmental process was steadilydeclining. Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic abouttheir future. A new kind of defeatism was heard. Some said our domesticproblems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with thisseemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between ouradministration and this Congress. It was said we could never work together.Well, those predictions were wrong. The record is clear, and I believe thathistory will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember thisadministration as an administration of change, and remember this Congressas a Congress of destiny.Together, we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly inhalf, we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweepingchanges in our tax structure since the beginning of this century. Andbecause we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation, we took awaygovernment\'s built in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to growlarger at the expense of American workers.Together, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the peoplein their States and local communities, we have started returning power andresources to them.Together, we have cut the growth of new Federal regulations nearly in half.In 1981 there were 23,000 fewer pages in the Federal Register, which listsnew regulations, than there were in 1980. By deregulating oil we\'ve comecloser to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost ofgasoline and heating fuel.Together, we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat wasteand fraud in government. In just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers morethan $2 billion, and it\'s only getting started.Together we\'ve begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicatewasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands ofAmericans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America\'s socialproblems.Together we\'ve begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensurespeace. Our country\'s uniform is being worn once again with pride.Together we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun.No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy. In my Inaugural Addresslast year, I warned that the "ills we suffer have come upon us over severaldecades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will goaway . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we\'ve had itin the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last andgreatest bastion of freedom."The economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead. But theprogram for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out ofits slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by thelatter half of this year. And that is why I can report to you tonight thatin the near future the state of the Union and the economy will bebetter much better if we summon the strength to continue on the coursethat we\'ve charted.And so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now? Well, twothings. First, we must understand what\'s happening at the moment to theeconomy. Our current problems are not the product of the recovery programthat\'s only just now getting underway, as some would have you believe; theyare the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will notrespond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integratedplan for recovery. That plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals:continued reduction of the growth in Federal spending; preserving theindividual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving andinvestment; removing unnecessary Federal regulations to spark productivity;and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy, the latter aresponsibility of the Federal Reserve System.The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return tothe policies that gave us a trillion dollar debt, runaway inflation,runaway interest rates and unemployment. The doubters would have us turnback the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax ratereductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to cutfuture deficits, they tell us. Well, I don\'t believe we should buy thatargument.There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits orsurpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy. The budget inplace, when I took office, had been projected as balanced. It turned out tohave one of the biggest deficits in history. Another example of theimponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable achange of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit upor down by some $25 billion.As it now stands, our forecast, which we\'re required by law to make, willshow major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars anddeclining, but still too high. More important, we\'re making progress withthe three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower interest rates,and spending control. The policies we have in place will reduce the deficitsteadily, surely, and in time, completely.Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits. If they did, how would weexplain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976; yet in thatsame 6 year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history. In1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion, and in 1980 we had one of ourall time biggest deficits. Raising taxes won\'t balance the budget; it willencourage more government spending and less private investment. Raisingtaxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy futurejobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and morelikely that those who now have jobs could lose them. So, I will not ask youto try to balance the budget on the backs of the American taxpayers.I will seek no tax increases this year, and I have no intention ofretreating from our basic program of tax relief. I promise to bring theAmerican people to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down, toprovide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest inAmerica\'s future. I will stand by my word. Tonight I\'m urging the Americanpeople: Seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to invest, andtogether we\'ll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom, hope, andprosperity again.Now, the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations. Therecession did that. It lowered revenues and increased costs. To someextent, we\'re also victims of our own success. We\'ve brought inflation downfaster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we\'ve deprivedgovernment of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes peopleinto higher income tax brackets. And the continued high interest rates lastyear cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.We must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out morewaste, and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employeesin the Federal work force by 75,000.The budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savingsby dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by eliminatingineffective subsidies for business. We\'ll continue to redirect ourresources to our two highest budget priorities a strong national defenseto keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety net of socialprograms for those who have contributed and those who are in need.Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, thisadministration has not and will not turn its back on America\'s elderly orAmerica\'s poor. Under the new budget, funding for social insurance programswill be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago. But it would befoolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficientand economical.The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needyhave worthy goals and many deserving recipients. We will protect them. Butthere\'s only one way to see to it that these programs really help thosewhom they were designed to help. And that is to bring their spiraling costsunder control.Today we face the absurd situation of a Federal budget with three quartersof its expenditures routinely referred to as "uncontrollable." And a largepart of this goes to entitlement programs.Committee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after witnessdescribe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with wasteand fraud. Virtually every American who shops in a local supermarket isaware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stamp program, whichhas grown by 16,000 percent in the last 15 years. Another example isMedicare and Medicaid programs with worthy goals but whose costs haveincreased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion, more than 5 times asmuch, in just 10 years.Waste and fraud are serious problems. Back in 1980 Federal investigatorstestified before one of your committees that "corruption has permeatedvirtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid health care industry."One official said many of the people who are cheating the system were "veryconfident that nothing was going to happen to them." Well, something isgoing to happen. Not only the taxpayers are defrauded; the people with realdependency on these programs are deprived of what they need, becauseavailable resources are going not to the needy, but to the greedy.The time has come to control the uncontrollable. In August we made a start.I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion overthe next 3 years while at the same time preserving essential services forthe truly needy. Shortly you will receive from me a message on furtherreforms we intend to install some new, but others long recommended by yourown congressional committees. I ask you to help make these savings for theAmerican taxpayer.The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some $63 billionover 4 Years and will, without affecting social t security, go a long waytoward bringing Federal spending under control.But don\'t be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprivethe elderly, the needy, and the helpless. The. Federal Government willstill subsidize 95 million meals every day. That\'s one out of seven of allthe meals served in America. Head Start, senior nutrition programs, andchild welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed lastyear. More than one half billion dollars has been proposed for minoritybusiness assistance. And research at the National Institute of Health willbe increased by over $100 million. While meeting all these needs, we intendto plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires alllarge corporations to pay a minimum tax.I am confident the economic program we\'ve put into operation will protectthe needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans. Itwill stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capitalfor expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, and jobs for the unemployed.Now that the essentials of that program are in place, our next majorundertaking must be a program just as bold, just as innovative to makegovernment again accountable to the people, to make our system offederalism work again.Our citizens feel they\'ve lost control of even the most basic decisionsmade about the essential services of government, such as schools, welfare,roads, and even garbage collection. And they\'re right. A maze ofinterlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts averagecitizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems. They don\'t knowwhere to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who toblame, who to vote for or against. The main reason for this is theoverpowering growth of Federal grants in aid programs during the past fewdecades.In 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs, costing$7 billion. When I took office, there were approximately 500, costingnearly a hundred billion dollars 13 programs for energy, 36 for pollutioncontrol, 66 for social services, 90 for education. And here in theCongress, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track ofthem.You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress canproperly oversee this jungle of grants in aid; indeed, the growth of thesegrants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government. Asone Democratic Governor put it recently: The National Government should beworrying about "arms control, not potholes."The growth in these Federal programs has in the words of oneintergovernmental commission made the Federal Government "more pervasive,more intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and costly, and aboveall, more (un) accountable." Let\'s solve this problem with a single, boldstroke: the return of some $47 billion in Federal programs to State andlocal government, together with the means to finance them and a transitionperiod of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption.I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program. I wantto emphasize, however, that its full details will have been worked out onlyafter close consultation with congressional, State, and local officials.Starting in fiscal 1984, the Federal Government will assume fullresponsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to goalong with its existing responsibility for Medicare. As part of afinancially equal swap, the States will simultaneously take fullresponsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps.This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need,because it\'ll be designed and administered closer to the grass roots andthe people it serves.In 1984 the Federal Government will apply the full proceeds from certainexcise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares tothe 50 States. The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billiona year. Over the next 4 years the States can use this money in either oftwo ways. If they want to continue receiving Federal grants in such areasas transportation, education, and social services, they can use their trustfund money to pay for the grants. Or to the extent they choose to forgo theFederal grant programs, they can use their trust fund money on their ownfor those or other purposes. There will be a mandatory pass through of partof these funds to local governments.By 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grantprograms. The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to disappear,and the excise taxes will be turned over to the States. They can thenpreserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage theseprograms as they see fit.In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will endcumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while weensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they\'remeant to help and the people who pay for them.Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibilityof State and local governments, we\'re proposing legislation for anexperimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the1980\'s and \'90\'s. This legislation will permit States and localities toapply to the Federal Government for designation as urban enterprise zones.A broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attractnew business, new jobs, new opportunity to America\'s inner cities and ruraltowns. Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise. Well, I say wemust free enterprise so that together we can save America.Some will also say our States and local communities are not up to thechallenge of a new and creative partnership. Well, that might have beentrue 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting RightsAct, the 10 year extension of which I strongly support. It\'s no longer truetoday. This administration has faith in State and local governments and theconstitutional balance envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We also believein the integrity, decency, and sound, good sense of grass roots Americans.Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successfulcommunity models of school, church, business, union, foundation, and civicprograms that help community needs. Such groups are almost invariably farmore efficient than government in running social programs.We\'re not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited governmentprograms dollar for dollar, service for service. We just want to help themperform the good works they choose and help others to profit by theirexample. Three hundred and eighty five thousand corporations and privateorganizations are already working on social programs ranging from drugrehabilitation to job training, and thousands more Americans have writtenus asking how they can help. The volunteer spirit is still alive and wellin America.Our nation\'s long journey towards civil rights for all our citizens oncea source of discord, now a source of pride must continue with nobacksliding or slowing down. We must and shall see that those basic lawsthat guarantee equal rights are preserved and, when necessary,strengthened.Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable. We launcheda new Task Force on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty States Project thatwill examine State laws for discriminatory language. And for the first timein our history, a woman sits on the highest court in the land.So, too, the problem of crime one as real and deadly serious as any inAmerica today. It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system,which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society andthe innocent victims of crime without justice.We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increasejobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air. We\'re encouragedby the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of furtherprogress as the Senate continues its deliberations.So far, I\'ve concentrated largely, now, on domestic matters. To view thestate of the Union in perspective, we must not ignore the rest of theworld. There isn\'t time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social orforeign policy, I should say, a subject I intend to address in detail inthe near future. A few words, however, are in order on the progress we\'vemade over the past year, reestablishing respect for our nation around theglobe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in theyear ahead.At Ottawa and Cancun, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers anddeveloping nations. Now, some of those I met with were a little surprisedthat I didn\'t apologize for America\'s wealth. Instead, I spoke of thestrength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help themrealize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom. Ibelieve lasting friendships were made, and the foundation was laid forfuture cooperation.In the vital region of the Caribbean Basin, we\'re developing a program ofaid, trade, and investment incentives to promote self sustaining growth anda better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south. Toward those whowould export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean and elsewhere,especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness.Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness, and balance. Byrestoring America\'s military credibility, by pursuing peace at thenegotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in goodfaith, and by regaining the respect of America\'s allies and adversariesalike, we have strengthened our country\'s position as a force for peace andprogress in the world.When action is called for, we\'re taking it. Our sanctions against themilitary dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights inPoland and against the Soviet regime behind that militarydictatorship clearly demonstrated to the world that America will notconduct "business as usual" with the forces of oppression. If the events inPoland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow.Now, let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead inmaking January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland. So, too,the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an internationalday of support for Afghanistan. Well, I urge all peace loving peoples tojoin together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray forfreedom.Meanwhile, we\'re working for reduction of arms and military activities, asI announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th. We haveproposed to the Soviet Union a far reaching agenda for mutual reduction ofmilitary forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Genevaon intermediate range nuclear forces. In those talks it is essential thatwe negotiate from a position of strength. There must be a real incentivefor the Soviets to take these talks seriously. This requires that werebuild our defenses.In the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power througha process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in anunrelenting buildup of their military forces. The protection of ournational security has required that we undertake a substantial program toenhance our military forces.We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe andAsia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle Eastand other countries. Building a more peaceful world requires a soundstrategy and the national resolve to back it up. When radical forcesthreaten our friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions ofinstability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under theshadow of Soviet power, our response can make the difference betweenpeaceful change or disorder and violence. That\'s why we\'ve laid such stressnot only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program.Your recent passage of the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal to theworld that America will not shrink from making the investments necessaryfor both peace and security. Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism,not naivete or self delusion.A recognition of what the Soviet empire is about is the starting point.Winston Churchill, in negotiating with the Soviets, observed that theyrespect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations.That\'s why we\'ve moved to reconstruct our national defenses. We intend tokeep the peace. We will also keep our freedom.We have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements andworldwide broadcasts. In the face of a climate of falsehood andmisinformation, we\'ve promised the world a season of truth the truth ofour great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative government,the rule of law under God. We\'ve never needed walls or minefields or barbedwire to keep our people in. Nor do we declare martial law to keep ourpeople from voting for the kind of government they want.Yes, we have our problems; yes, we\'re in a time of recession. And it\'strue, there\'s no quick fix, as I said, to instantly end the tragic pain ofunemployment. But we will end it. The process has already begun, and we\'llsee its effect as the year goes on.We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans whoovercame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago. Butour glory didn\'t end with them. Americans ever since have emulated theirdeeds.We don\'t have to turn to our history books for heroes. They\'re all aroundus. One who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism at the endof the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our Armed Forces. Whowill ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us thescene of that first plane landing at Clark Field in the Philippines,bringing our POW\'s home? The plane door opened and Jeremiah Denton cameslowly down the ramp. He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said, "Godbless America," and then thanked us for bringing him home.Just 2 weeks ago, in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac, we sawagain the spirit of American heroism at its finest the heroism ofdedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters. And we sawthe heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Skutnik, who,when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived into thewater and dragged her to safety.And then there are countless, quiet, everyday heroes of American whosacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life thanthey\'ve known; church and civic volunteers who help to feed, clothe, nurse,and teach the needy; millions who\'ve made our nation and our nation\'sdestiny so very special unsung heroes who may not have realized their owndreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children.Don\'t let anyone tell you that America\'s best days are behind her, that theAmerican spirit has been vanquished. We\'ve seen it triumph too often in ourlives to stop believing in it now.A hundred and twenty years ago, the greatest of all our Presidentsdelivered his second State of the Union message in this Chamber. "We cannotescape history," Abraham Lincoln warned. "We of this Congress and thisadministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves." The "trialthrough which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to thelatest (last) generation."Well, that President and that Congress did not fail the American people.Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union. Let it be saidof us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to bringAmerica through difficult times. Let us so conduct ourselves that twocenturies from now, another Congress and another President, meeting in thisChamber as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we metthe test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame ofliberty this last, best hope of man on Earth.God bless you, and thank you.NOTE: The President spoke at 9 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol.He was introduced by Thomas P. O\'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radioand television.
Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the UnitedStates has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington firstdid so in 1790. That\'s a lot of reports, but there\'s no shortage of newthings to say about the State of the Union. The very key to our success hasbeen our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our lasting values bymaking change work for us rather than against us.I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can dotogether not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans to maketomorrow\'s America happy and prosperous at home, strong and respectedabroad, and at peace in the world.As we gather here tonight, the state of our Union is strong, but oureconomy is troubled. For too many of our fellow citizens farmers, steel andauto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers this is a painfulperiod. We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to anend. It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that was a long timein the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task of building abetter future for ourselves and our children.We have a long way to go, but thanks to the courage, patience, and strengthof our people, America is on the mend.But let me give you just one important reason why I believe this itinvolves many members of this body.Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisanCommission on Social Security accomplished the seemingly impossible. Socialsecurity, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster. I, myself,have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years. As 1983 began,the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of oureconomic ills. First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves aswe tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living. Thenthe recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wagebase and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 millionAmericans who depend on it.When the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and I performedthe bipartisan or formed the bipartisan Commission on Social Security,pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflictinginterests would prevent the Commission from agreeing on a plan to savesocial security. Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics arewrong. Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the Commissionovercame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan. They provedthat, when it comes to the national welfare, Americans can still pulltogether for the common good.Tonight, I\'m especially pleased to join with the Speaker and the Senatemajority leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but takentogether it performs a package that all of us can support. It asks for somesacrifice by all the self employed, beneficiaries, workers, governmentemployees, and the better off among the retired but it imposes an undueburden on none. And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to theAmerican people: The integrity of the social security system will bepreserved, and no one\'s payments will be reduced.The Commission\'s plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job. We oweit to today\'s older Americans and today\'s younger workers. So, before we goany further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of theCommission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker andSpeaker Tip O\'Neill for a job well done. I hope and pray the bipartisanspirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we facethe challenges of the year ahead.Nearly half a century ago, in this Chamber, another American President,Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his second State of the Union message, urgedAmerica to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and the needfor leadership that looks forward, not backward."Throughout the world," he said, "change is the order of the day. In everynation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to (of)many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory wereunprepared." He also reminded us that "the future lies with those wisepolitical leaders who realize that the great public is interested more inGovernment than in politics."So, let us, in these next 2 years men and women of both parties, everypolitical shade concentrate on the long range, bipartisan responsibilitiesof government, not the short range or short term temptations of partisanpolitics.The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out ofgovernment had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and outof government had predicted. Curing those problems has taken more time anda higher toll than any of us wanted. Unemployment is far too high.Projected Federal spending if government refuses to tighten its ownbelt will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economicrecovery now underway.This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence andspending for consumer items and capital goods the stimulus we need torestart our stalled economic engines. The American people have alreadystepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed tomodernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow tobusiness and industry.The inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1/2 percent interest primerate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half.Leaders have started to realize that double digit inflation is no longer away of life. I misspoke there. I should have said "lenders."So, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vitalindustries like housing and autos.The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in. Housing startsfor the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago, andhousing permits, a sure indicator of future growth, were up a whopping 60percent.We\'re witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence thatAmerican industry will once again become competitive in markets at home andabroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the Nation\'s work force.But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience. Quickfixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are whatbrought us the inflationary disorders that we\'ve now paid such a heavyprice to cure.The permanent recovery in employment, production, and investment we seekwon\'t come in a sharp, short spurt. It\'ll build carefully and steadily inthe months and years ahead. In the meantime, the challenge of government isto identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economictransition for the American people.The Federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we couldface the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trilliondollars more in national debt in the next 4 years alone. That would average$4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child, and baby in ournation.To assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway spendingunder control to bring those deficits down. If we don\'t, the recovery willbe too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we will leave anunconscionable burden of national debt for our children. That we must notdo.Let\'s be clear about where the deficit problem comes from. Contrary to thedrumbeat we\'ve been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we faceare not rooted in defense spending. Taken as a percentage of the grossnational product, our defense spending happens to be only about four fifthsof what it was in 1970. Nor is the deficit, as some would have it, rootedin tax cuts. Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross nationalproduct remain about the same as they were in 1970. The fact is, ourdeficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domesticspending.During the 1970\'s, the share of our national income devoted to thisdomestic spending increased by more than 60 percent, from 10 cents out ofevery dollar produced by the American people to 16 cents. In spite of allour economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs, basic,necessary domestic spending provided for in this year\'s budget will grow toalmost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years.The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health ofour Republic. We need a plan to overcome this danger a plan based on theseprinciples. It must be bipartisan. Conquering the deficits and putting theGovernment\'s house in order will require the best effort of all of us. Itmust be fair. Just as all will share in the benefits that will come fromrecovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition. It must beprudent. The strength of our national defense must be restored so that wecan pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining ourcommitment to the truly needy. And finally, it must be realistic. We can\'trely on hope alone.With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four part plan toincrease economic growth and reduce deficits.First, in my budget message, I will recommend a Federal spending freeze. Iknow this is strong medicine, but so far, we have only cut the rate ofincrease in Federal spending. The Government has continued to spend moremoney each year, though not as much more as it did in the past. Taken as awhole, the budget I\'m proposing for the fiscal year will increase no morethan the rate of inflation. In other words, the Federal Government willhold the line on real spending. Now, that\'s far less than many Americanfamilies have had to do in these difficult times.I will request that the proposed 6 month freeze in cost of livingadjustments recommended by the bipartisan Social Security Commission beapplied to other government related retirement programs. I will, also,propose a 1 year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, andfor Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs. And let me sayright here, I\'m sorry, with regard to the military, in asking that of them,because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in rewardfor what the men and women in uniform are doing. But I\'m sure they willunderstand that this must be across the board and fair.Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control thegrowth of the so called uncontrollable spending programs. These are theautomatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simplyfrozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970. They are thelargest single cause of the built in or structural deficit problem. Ourstandard here will be fairness, ensuring that the taxpayers\' hard earneddollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them are turned away, butthat fraud and waste are stamped out. And I\'m sorry to say, there\'s a lotof it out there. In the food stamp program alone, last year, we identifiedalmost $1.1 billion in overpayments. The taxpayers aren\'t the only victimsof this kind of abuse. The truly needy suffer as funds intended for themare taken not by the needy, but by the greedy. For everyone\'s sake, we mustput an end to such waste and corruption.Third, I will adjust our program to restore America\'s defenses by proposing$55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years. These are savingsrecommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they canbe safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate armsreductions or endanger America\'s security. We will not gamble with ournational survival.And fourth, because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination ofdeficits over the next several years, I will propose a standby tax, limitedto no more than 1 percent of the gross national product, to start in fiscal1986. It would last no more than 3 years, and it would start only if theCongress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program.And there are several other conditions also that must be met, all of themin order for this program to be triggered.Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, aremedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutelynecessary. In the meantime, we\'ll continue to study ways to simplify thetax code and make it more fair for all Americans. This is a goal that everyAmerican who\'s ever struggled with a tax form can understand.At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic taxreforms that we\'ve already enacted, including the 10 percent tax breakcoming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will protect allAmericans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead.Now, I realize that this four part plan is easier to describe than it willbe to enact. But the looming deficits that hang over us and over America\'sfuture must be reduced. The path I\'ve outlined is fair, balanced, andrealistic. If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits, aimingtoward a balanced budget by the end of the decade. It\'s the only path thatwill lead to a strong, sustained recovery. Let us follow that pathtogether.No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobsfor all Americans who want to work. The recovery program will provide jobsfor most, but others will need special help and training for new skills.Shortly, I will submit to the Congress the Employment Act of 1983, designedto get at the special problems of the long term unemployed, as well asyoung people trying to enter the job market. I\'ll propose extendingunemployment benefits, including special incentives to employers who hirethe long term unemployed, providing programs for displaced workers, andhelping federally funded and State administered unemployment insuranceprograms provide workers with training and relocation assistance. Finally,our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment tohelp young people get a start in the job market.We must offer both short term help and long term hope for our unemployed. Ihope we can work together on this. I hope we can work together as we didlast year in enacting the landmark Job Training Partnership Act. Regulatoryreform legislation, a responsible clean air act, and passage of enterprisezone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity.One of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade. So, I willpropose a broader strategy in the field of international trade one thatincreases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America\'sfarmers and workers in the world marketplace. We must have adequate exportfinancing to sell American products overseas. I will ask for newnegotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our productsinto foreign markets. We must strengthen the organization of our tradeagencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international tradepolicy to promote free trade and the increased flow of American goods,services, and investments.Our trade position can also be improved by making our port system moreefficient. Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in ourcoalfields, railroads, trucking industry, and ports. After 2 years ofdebate, it\'s time for us to get together and enact a port modernizationbill.Education, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as areresearch and development and productivity. Labor, management, andgovernment at all levels can and must participate in improving these toolsof growth. Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government programs allneed constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness. Every Americanhas a role and a stake in international trade.We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields. We mustkeep that edge, and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics startingwith our educational system. While we grew complacent, others have acted.Japan, with a population only about half the size of ours, graduates fromits universities more engineers than we do. If a child doesn\'t receiveadequate math and science teaching by the age of 16, he or she has lost thechance to be a scientist or an engineer. We must join together parents,teachers, grass roots groups, organized labor, and the businesscommunity to revitalize American education by setting a standard ofexcellence.In 1983 we seek four major education goals: a quality education initiativeto encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instructionthrough block grants to the States; establishment of education savingsaccounts that will give middle and lower income families an incentive tosave for their children\'s college education and, at the same time,encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth; passage oftuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to privateor religiously affiliated schools; a constitutional amendment to permitvoluntary school prayer. God should never have been expelled from America\'sclassrooms in the first place.Our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economicequity for women, and eliminate, once and for all, all traces of unjustdiscrimination against women from the United States Code. We will nottolerate wage discrimination based on sex, and we intend to strengthenenforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents, most ofwhom are women, do not suffer unfair financial hardship. We will also takeaction to remedy inequities in pensions. These initiatives will be joinedby others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.Also in the area of fairness and equity, we will ask for extension of theCivil Rights Commission, which is due to expire this year. The Commissionis an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America, and westrongly support its reauthorization. Effective enforcement of our nation\'sfair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity. In theyear ahead, we\'ll work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws forall Americans.The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutesand acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.It\'s high time that we make our cities safe again. This administrationhereby declares an all out war on big time organized crime and the drugracketeers who are poisoning our young people. We will also implementrecommendations of our Task Force on Victims of Crime, which will report tome this week.American agriculture, the envy of the world, has become the victim of itsown successes. With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himselfand 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus crops andcommodity prices below the cost of production. We must strive, throughinnovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressiveexport policy, to restore health and vitality to rural America. Meanwhile,I have instructed the Department of Agriculture to work individually withfarmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times.Over the past year, our Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives hassuccessfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business,labor, education, and government to address the training needs of Americanworkers. Thanks to the Task Force, private sector initiatives are nowunderway in all 50 States of the Union, and thousands of working peoplehave been helped in making the shift from dead end jobs and low demandskills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy.Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansionof private community child care. The new advisory council on private sectorinitiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging privateinitiative in 1983.In the coming year, we will also act to improve the quality of life forAmericans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becomingan unbearable financial burden for so many. And we will submit legislationto provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that willcontinue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their rolesas dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.During the next several weeks, I will send to the Congress a series ofdetailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to workingwith you on the development of these initiatives.So far, now, I\'ve concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future.But in almost every home and workplace in America, we\'re already witnessingreason for great hope the first flowering of the manmade miracles of hightechnology, a field pioneered and still led by our country.To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics,and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are asmystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been whenthat first Model T rattled down Main Street, U.S.A. But as surely asAmerica\'s pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century,the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front ofopportunity, the frontier of high technology.In conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries,but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneerof tomorrow. This administration is committed to keeping America thetechnological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.But let us turn briefly to the international arena. America\'s leadership inthe world came to us because of our own strength and because of the valueswhich guide us as a society: free elections, a free press, freedom ofreligious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom for theindividual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state. These valuesare the bedrock of our strength. They unite us in a stewardship of peaceand freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America,and elsewhere. They are also the values which in the recent past some amongus had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.Fortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our commondemocratic values, and we\'re applying them as a cornerstone of acomprehensive strategy for peace with freedom. In London last year, Iannounced the commitment of the United States to developing theinfrastructure of democracy throughout the world. We intend to pursue thisdemocratic initiative vigorously. The future belongs not to governments andideologies which oppress their peoples, but to democratic systems ofself government which encourage individual initiative and guaranteepersonal freedom.But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based onstrength economic strength and military strength. A strong Americaneconomy is essential to the well being and security of our friends andallies. The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been andremains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy. The progress I\'vebeen able to report to you tonight will, I know, be as warmly welcomed bythe rest of the world as it is by the American people.We must also recognize that our own economic well being is inextricablylinked to the world economy. We export over 20 percent of our industrialproduction, and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export. We willcontinue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe andJapan and with the International Monetary Fund to ensure it has adequateresources to help bring the world economy back to strong, noninflationarygrowth.As the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and richbecause of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting advocate offree trade. As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, ourstrategy cannot be to follow them, but to lead the way toward freer trade.To this end, in May of this year America will host an economic summitmeeting in Williamsburg, Virginia.As we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program thatredeems the neglect of the past decade. We have developed a realisticmilitary strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom ifdeterrence fails. Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid; after yearsof neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied. Andthe American uniform is once again worn with pride. Most of the majorsystems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway, and wewill be addressing one key system, the MX missile, in consultation with theCongress in a few months.America\'s foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism,strength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies, andconstructive negotiation with potential adversaries. From the Middle Eastto southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the initiativeto make peace and lower arms levels. We should be proud of our role aspeacemakers.In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role inending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of thePLO from Beirut.Last September, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process begunso promisingly at Camp David. All the people of the Middle East should knowthat in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on thatfoundation to bring them the blessings of peace.In Central America and the Caribbean Basin, we are likewise engaged in apartnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy. Final passage of theremaining portions of our Caribbean Basin Initiative, which passed theHouse last year, is one of this administration\'s top legislative prioritiesfor 1983.The security and economic assistance policies of this administration inLatin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a criticalinvestment in the future of the human race. This undertaking is a jointresponsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and I\'m countingon the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to help us meet thisessential foreign policy goal.At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the SovietUnion. The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership. We\'re prepared fora positive change in Soviet American relations. But the Soviet Union mustshow by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rightsand sovereignty of the family of nations. Responsible members of the worldcommunity do not threaten or invade their neighbors. And they restraintheir allies from aggression.For our part, we\'re vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations withthe Soviet Union. Supported by our allies, we\'ve put forward draftagreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiablelower levels. We insist on an equal balance of forces. And given theoverwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international treatiesconcerning chemical and biological weapons, we also insist that anyagreement we sign can and will be verifiable.In the case of intermediate range nuclear forces, we have proposed thecomplete elimination of the entire class of land based missiles. We\'re alsoprepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals. At the same time,let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving armsreductions.With firmness and dedication, we\'ll continue to negotiate. Deep down, theSoviets must know it\'s in their interest as well as ours to prevent awasteful arms race. And once they recognize our unshakable resolve tomaintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in thesearch for greater security and major arms reductions. When that momentcomes and I\'m confident that it will we will have taken an important steptoward a more peaceful future for all the world\'s people.A very wise man, Bernard Baruch, once said that America has never forgottenthe nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path. Ourcountry is a special place, because we Americans have always beensustained, through good times and bad, by a noble vision a vision not onlyof what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can makeit be tomorrow.We\'re realists; we solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matterhow loud the chorus of despair around us. But we\'re also idealists, for itwas an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every cornerof the world.Right now we need both realism and idealism. Millions of our neighbors arewithout work. It is up to us to see they aren\'t without hope. This is atask for all of us. And may I say, Americans have rallied to this cause,proving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth.We who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy. Andhere all that time, I thought you were reading the paper.The single thing the single thing that can start the wheels of industryturning again is further reduction of interest rates. Just another 1 or 2points can mean tens of thousands of jobs.Right now, with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room forinterest rates to come down. Only fear prevents their reduction. A lender,as we know, must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciatedvalue of the dollars loaned. And that depreciation is, of course, theamount of inflation. Today, interest rates are based on fear fear thatgovernment will resort to measures, as it has in the past, that will sendinflation zooming again.We who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making itabsolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that, together,we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth.Yes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding. And, certainly,no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends andneighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment. But wemust and can give them good reason to be hopeful.Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within thesewalls when our nation was threatened; sometimes when its very existence wasat stake. Always with courage and common sense, they met the crises oftheir time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperouscountry. The present situation is no worse and, in fact, is not as bad assome of those they faced. Time and again, they proved that there is nothingwe Americans cannot achieve as free men and women.Yes, we still have problems plenty of them. But it\'s just plainwrong unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let thoseproblems stand in the way of the most important truth of all: America is onthe mend.We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help themin every way we can. No one can quarrel with that. We must and do havecompassion for all the victims of this economic crisis. But the big storyabout America today is the way that millions of confident, caringpeople those extraordinary "ordinary" Americans who never make theheadlines and will never be interviewed are laying the foundation, notjust for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow forall our people.From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at newconstruction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors arehelping neighbors. And they\'ve already begun the building, the research,the work, and the giving that will make our country great again.I believe this, because I believe in them in the strength of their heartsand minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to their dailylives, be they high or humble. The challenge for us in government is to beworthy of them to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people inthe challenging but promising days ahead.If we do that, if we care what our children and our children\'s childrenwill say of us, if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did herein these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America betterfor our having been here not just in this year or this decade but in thenext century and beyond.Thank you, and God bless you.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Thomas P. O\'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radioand television.
Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:Once again, in keeping with time honored tradition, I have come to reportto you on the state of the Union, and I\'m pleased to report that America ismuch improved, and there\'s good reason to believe that improvement willcontinue through the days to come.You and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past. Butthey didn\'t keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop along decline that had drained this nation\'s spirit and eroded its health.There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land. America is back,standing tall, looking to the eighties with courage, confidence, and hope.The problems we\'re overcoming are not the heritage of one person, party, oreven one generation. It\'s just the tendency of government to grow, forpractices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life we\'llever see on this Earth. And there\'s always that well intentioned chorus ofvoices saying, "With a little more power and a little more money, we coulddo so much for the people." For a time we forgot the American dream isn\'tone of making government bigger; it\'s keeping faith with the mighty spiritof free people under God.As we came to the decade of the eighties, we faced the worst crisis in ourpostwar history. In the seventies were years of rising problems and fallingconfidence. There was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent ofthe governed. Families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation andthe indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work, thrift, andrisktaking. All this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of rules andregulations.On the international scene, we had an uncomfortable feeling that we\'d lostthe respect of friend and foe. Some questioned whether we had the will todefend peace and freedom. But America is too great for small dreams. Therewas a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival; if you will, a crusadefor renewal. The American people said: Let us look to the future withconfidence, both at home and abroad. Let us give freedom a chance.Americans were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done it.We\'re confronting our problems one by one. Hope is alive tonight formillions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair taxincreases and crushing inflation. Inflation has been beaten down from 12.4to 3.2 percent, and that\'s a great victory for all the people. The primerate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to bring itdown even more.Together, we passed the first across the board tax reduction for everyonesince the Kennedy tax cuts. Next year, tax rates will be indexed soinflation can\'t push people into higher brackets when they getcost of living pay raises. Government must never again use inflation toprofit at the people\'s expense.Today a working family earning $25,000 has $1,100 more in purchasing powerthan if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels. Realafter tax income increased 5 percent last year. And economic deregulationof key industries like transportation has offered more chances orchoices, I should say, to consumers and new changes or chances forentrepreneurs and protecting safety. Tonight, we can report and be proud ofone of the best recoveries in decades. Send away the handwringers and thedoubting Thomases. Hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes andfor risktakers with vision to create tomorrow\'s opportunities.The spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of high techand by small business people with big ideas people like Barbara Proctor,who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion dollar advertising agency inChicago; Carlos Perez, a Cuban refugee, who turned $27 and a dream into asuccessful importing business in Coral Gables, Florida.People like these are heroes for the eighties. They helped 4 millionAmericans find jobs in 1983. More people are drawing paychecks tonight thanever before. And Congress helps or progress helps everyone well, Congressdoes too  everyone. In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobsin managerial, professional, and technical fields.But we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work,wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams. Can we love America andnot reach out to tell them: You are not forgotten; we will not rest untileach of you can reach as high as your God given talents will take you.The heart of America is strong; it\'s good and true. The cynics were wrong;America never was a sick society. We\'re seeing rededication to bedrockvalues of faith, family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom valuesthat help bring us together as one people, from the youngest child to themost senior citizen.The Congress deserves America\'s thanks for helping us restore pride andcredibility to our military. And I hope that you\'re as proud as I am of theyoung men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts indefense of freedom and whose dedication, valor, and skill increases so muchour chance of living in a world at peace.People everywhere hunger for peace and a better life. The tide of thefuture is a freedom tide, and our struggle for democracy cannot and willnot be denied. This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty,democratic rights, and dignity for every individual. America\'s newstrength, confidence, and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity farfrom our shores. A world economic recovery is underway. It began here.We\'ve journeyed far, but we have much farther to go. Franklin Roosevelttold us 50 years ago this month: "Civilization can not go back;civilization must not stand still. We have undertaken new methods. It isour task to perfect, to improve, to alter when necessary, but in all casesto go forward."It\'s time to move forward again, time for America to take freedom\'s nextstep. Let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep America free,secure, and at peace in the eighties together.We can ensure steady economic growth. We can develop America\'s nextfrontier. We can strengthen our traditional values. And we can build ameaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faiththat has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom,progress, and hope.Doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity, providegreater security for all, with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination.The key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth, our first greatgoal. We might well begin with common sense in Federal budgeting:government spending no more than government takes in.We must bring Federal deficits down. But how we do that makes all thedifference.We can begin by limiting the size and scope of government. Under theleadership of Vice President Bush, we have reduced the growth of Federalregulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours ofgovernment required paperwork each year. This will save the public morethan $150 billion over the next 10 years.The Grace commission has given us some 2,500 recommendations for reducingwasteful spending, and they\'re being examined throughout theadministration. Federal spending growth has been cut from 17.4 percent in1980 to less than half of that today, and we have already achieved over$300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to \'86. But that\'sonly a little more than half of what we sought. Government is stillspending too large a percentage of the total economy.Now, some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained byreducing the portion spent on defense. This ignores the fact that nationaldefense is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government; indeed, itis its prime responsibility. And yet defense spending is less than a thirdof the total budget. During the years of President Kennedy and of the yearsbefore that, defense was almost half the total budget. And then cameseveral years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorateto a very dangerous degree. We are just now restoring, through theessential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces, ourcapability to meet our present and future security needs. We dare not shirkour responsibility to keep America free, secure, and at peace.The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control. Butthe basis for such spending had been laid in previous years. A pattern ofoverspending has been in place for half a century. As the national debtgrew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to ourselves.Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry. But there\'s a differenceof opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending cut, or someof both. Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficitcould inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for businessand industrial expansion. Well, I think that debate is missing an importantpoint. Whether government borrows or increases taxes, it will be taking thesame amount of money from the private sector, and, either way, that\'s toomuch. Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes onfamilies struggling to pay their bills. The root of the problem is thatgovernment\'s share is more than we can afford if we\'re to have a soundeconomy.We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth. In thebudget that I will submit on February 1st, I will recommend measures thatwill reduce the deficit over the next 5 years. Many of these will beunfinished business from last year\'s budget.Some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort toaddress this problem. I spoke today with Speaker of the House O\'Neill,Senate Majority Leader Baker, Senate Minority Leader Byrd, and HouseMinority Leader Michel. I asked them if they would designate congressionalrepresentatives to meet with representatives of the administration to tryto reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan. I know itwould take a long, hard struggle to agree on a full scale plan. So, what Ihave proposed is that we first see if we can agree on a down payment.Now, I believe there is basis for such an agreement, one that could reducethe deficits by about a hundred billion dollars over the next 3 years. Wecould focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are stillpending before the Congress. These could be combined with measures to closecertain tax loopholes, measures that the Treasury Department has previouslysaid to be worthy of support. In addition, we could examine the possibilityof achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the Gracecommission.If the congressional leadership is willing, my representatives will beprepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time. I would hopethe leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to developand enact that down payment.But a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficitproblem. It could help us start on the right path. Yet, we must do more.So, I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structuralreforms to curb the built in growth of spending.I also propose improvements in the budgeting process. Some 43 of our 50States grant their Governors the right to veto individual items inappropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill. California isone of those 43 States. As Governor, I found this line item veto was apowerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending. It works in 43States. Let\'s put it to work in Washington for all the people.It would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment. Themajority of Americans approve of such an amendment, just as they and Iapprove of an amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget. Many Statesalso have this protection in their constitutions.To talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a Band Aidsolution which does nothing to cure an illness that\'s been coming on forhalf a century to say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat toeconomic recovery. Let\'s remember that a substantial amount of income taxis presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy. Itwould be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensatefor those who aren\'t paying their share.There\'s a better way. Let us go forward with an historic reform forfairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth. I am asking Secretary DonRegan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so alltaxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly. And I believe such aplan could result in that underground economy being brought into thesunlight of honest tax compliance. And it could make the tax base broader,so personal tax rates could come down, not go up. I\'ve asked that specificrecommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me byDecember 1984.Our second great goal is to build on America\'s pioneer spirit I saidsomething funny? I said America\'s next frontier and that\'s to develop thatfrontier. A sparkling economy spurs initiatives, sunrise industries, andmakes older ones more competitive.Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier: space. Nowhere do weso effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to makelife better on Earth. The Space Age is barely a quarter of a century old.But already we\'ve pushed civilization forward with our advances in scienceand technology. Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross newthresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown.Our progress in space taking giant steps for all mankind is a tribute toAmerican teamwork and excellence. Our finest minds in government, industry,and academia have all pulled together. And we can be proud to say: We arefirst; we are the best; and we are so because we\'re free.America has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reachfor greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living andworking in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight, I amdirecting NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do itwithin a decade.A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science,communications, in metals, and in lifesaving medicines which could bemanufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet thesechallenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries toparticipate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expandfreedom for all who share our goals.Just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and Yankeetraders, space holds enormous potential for commerce today. The market forspace transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it. Companiesinterested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to privatesector launch services. The Department of Transportation will help anexpendable launch services industry to get off the ground. We\'ll soonimplement a number of executive initiatives, develop proposals to easeregulatory constraints, and, with NASA\'s help, promote private sectorinvestment in space.And as we develop the frontier of space, let us remember our responsibilityto preserve our older resources here on Earth. Preservation of ourenvironment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it\'s common sense.Though this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for EPA oneof the largest percentage budget increases of any agency. We will begin thelong, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and aspecial national resource the Chesapeake Bay.To reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps, EPA willspend $410 million. And I will request a supplemental increase of 50million. And because the Superfund law expires in 1985, I\'ve asked BillRuckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there\'ll beadditional time to complete this important task.On the question of acid rain, which concerns people in many areas of theUnited States and Canada, I\'m proposing a research program that doubles ourcurrent funding. And we\'ll take additional action to restore our lakes anddevelop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain.We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources. We\'ll askthe Congress for $157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park andconservation lands. The Department of the Interior will encourage careful,selective exploration and production on our vital resources in an ExclusiveEconomic Zone within the 200 mile limit off our coasts but with strictadherence to environmental laws and with fuller State and publicparticipation.But our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are theminds and hearts of our people, especially our children. We can help thembuild tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values. This mustbe our third great goal. For us, faith, work, family, neighborhood,freedom, and peace are not just words; they\'re expressions of what Americameans, definitions of what makes us a good and loving people.Families stand at the center of our society. And every family has apersonal stake in promoting excellence in education. Excellence does notbegin in Washington. A 600 percent increase in Federal spending oneducation between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline inScholastic Aptitude Test scores. Excellence must begin in our homes andneighborhood schools, where it\'s the responsibility of every parent andteacher and the right of every child.Our children come first, and that\'s why I established a bipartisan NationalCommission on Excellence in Education, to help us chart a commonsensecourse for better education. And already, communities are implementing theCommission\'s recommendations. Schools are reporting progress in math andreading skills. But we must do more to restore discipline to schools; andwe must encourage the teaching of new basics, reward teachers of merit,enforce tougher standards, and put our parents back in charge.I will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunitiesfor families and to soften the double payment for those paying publicschool taxes and private school tuition. Our proposal would targetassistance to low  and middle income families. Just as more incentives areneeded within our schools, greater competition is needed among our schools.Without standards and competition, there can be no champions, no recordsbroken, no excellence in education or any other walk of life.And while I\'m on this subject, each day your Members observe a 200 year oldtradition meant to signify America is one nation under God. I must ask: Ifyou can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right hereleading you in prayer, then why can\'t freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyedagain by children in every schoolroom across this land?America was founded by people who believed that God was their rock ofsafety. He is ours. I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that God ison our side, but I think it\'s all right to keep asking if we\'re on Hisside.During our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restoreprotection of the law to unborn children. Now, I know this issue is verycontroversial. But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn childis not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that itisn\'t? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is tothe contrary. We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and ifAmericans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping,then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion.Economic recovery, better education, rededication to values, all show thespirit of renewal gaining the upper hand. And all will improve family lifein the eighties. But families need more. They need assurance that they andtheir loved ones can walk the streets of America without being afraid.Parents need to know their children will not be victims of childpornography and abduction. This year we will intensify our drive againstthese and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence.Already our efforts to crack down on career criminals, organized crime,drugpushers, and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are havingeffect. In 1982 the crime rate dropped by 4.3 percent, the biggest declinesince 1972. Protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding therights of defendants.Opportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fairhousing and work to ensure women\'s rights, provide for equitable treatmentin pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts, facilitate childcare, and enforce delinquent parent support payments.It\'s not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain ourvalues and shape our future. So, I ask your help in assisting morecommunities to break the bondage of dependency. Help us to free enterpriseby permitting debate and voting "yes" on our proposal for enterprise zonesin America. This has been before you for 2 years. Its passage can helphigh unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods.A society bursting with opportunities, reaching for its future withconfidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good andcourageous people will flourish when they\'re free these are the secrets ofa strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.A lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal. It is our highestaspiration. And our record is clear: Americans resort to force only when wemust. We have never been aggressors. We have always struggled to defendfreedom and democracy.We have no territorial ambitions. We occupy no countries. We build no wallsto lock people in. Americans build the future. And our vision of a betterlife for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the Americas to Asia,begins with a simple premise: The future is best decided by ballots, notbullets.Governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war ontheir neighbors. Only when people are given a personal stake in decidingtheir own destiny, benefiting from their own risks, do they createsocieties that are prosperous, progressive, and free. Tonight, it isdemocracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry, prolonging life, andeliminating drudgery.When it comes to keeping America strong, free, and at peace, there shouldbe no Republicans or Democrats, just patriotic Americans. We can decide thetough issues not by who is right, but by what is right.Together, we can continue to advance our agenda for peace. We can establisha more stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet Union;strengthen allied relations across the board; achieve real and equitablereductions in the levels of nuclear arms; reinforce our peacemaking effortsin the Middle East, Central America, and southern Africa; or assistdeveloping countries, particularly our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere;and assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout theworld.The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of theScowcroft commission, which strengthened our ability to deter war andprotect peace. In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with theHenry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the BipartisanCommission on Central America.Your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon isalso serving the cause of peace. We are making progress in Lebanon. Fornearly 10 years, the Lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy with nohope for their future. Now the multinational peacekeeping force and ourmarines are helping them break their cycle of despair. There is hope for afree, independent, and sovereign Lebanon. We must have the courage to givepeace a chance. And we must not be driven from our objectives for peace inLebanon by state sponsored terrorism. We have seen this ugly specter inBeirut, Kuwait, and Rangoon. It demands international attention. I willforward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism. And I willbe seeking support from our allies for concerted action.Our NATO alliance is strong. 1983 was a banner year for political courage.And we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in the FarEast. We\'re committed to dialog, deterrence, and promoting prosperity.We\'ll work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations insupport of freer world trade, greater competition, and more open markets.A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, and militarydeterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and ourallies abroad underline a fundamental and far reaching change: The UnitedStates is safer, stronger, and more secure in 1984 than before. We can nowmove with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace, and we will.Tonight, I want to speak to the people of the Soviet Union, to tell themit\'s true that our governments have had serious differences, but our sonsand daughters have never fought each other in war. And if we Americans haveour way, they never will.People of the Soviet Union, there is only one sane policy, for your countryand mine, to preserve our civilization in this modern age: A nuclear warcannot be won and must never be fought. The only value in our two nationspossessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used. Butthen would it not be better to do away with them entirely?People of the Soviet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who fought by your sidein World War II, said the essential struggle "is not merely man against manor nation against nation. It is man against war." Americans are people ofpeace. If your government wants peace, there will be peace. We can cometogether in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world forour children and our children\'s children. And the whole world will rejoice.That is my message to you.Some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us ora friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to beAmericans.Sergeant Stephen Trujillo, a medic in the 2d Ranger Battalion, 75thInfantry, was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by Cubanforces in Grenada. He saw three other helicopters crash. Despite theimminent explosion of the burning aircraft, he never hesitated. He ranacross 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue woundedsoldiers. He directed two other medics, administered first aid, andreturned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends tosafety.Sergeant Trujillo, you and your fellow service men and women not only savedinnocent lives; you set a nation free. You inspire us as a force forfreedom, not for despotism; and, yes, for peace, not conquest. God blessyou.And then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and civicvolunteers. Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family andcommunity problems. They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds, calm ourfears, and share our joy.A person like Father Ritter is always there. His Covenant House programs inNew York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightenedand abused children each year. The same is true of Dr. Charles Carson.Paralyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is impossible. Todayin Minnesota, he works 80 hours a week without pay, helping pioneer thefield of computer controlled walking. He has given hope to 500,000paralyzed Americans that some day they may walk again.How can we not believe in the greatness of America? How can we not do whatis right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on Earth? Afterall our struggles to restore America, to revive confidence in our country,hope for our future, after all our hard won victories earned through thepatience and courage of every citizen, we cannot, must not, and will notturn back. We will finish our job. How could we do less? We\'re Americans.Carl Sandburg said, "I see America not in the setting sun of a black nightof despair... I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun freshfrom the burning, creative hand of God... I see great days ahead for menand women of will and vision."I\'ve never felt more strongly that America\'s best days and democracy\'s bestdays lie ahead. We\'re a powerful force for good. With faith and courage, wecan perform great deeds and take freedom\'s next step. And we will. We willcarry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought lightwhere there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where therewas disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was onlybloodshed.Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, thatin our time we did everything that could be done. We finished the race; wekept them free; we kept the faith.Thank you very much. God bless you, and God bless America.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:02 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Thomas P. O\'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives.

Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:I come before you to report on the state of our Union, and I\'m pleased toreport that after 4 years of united effort, the American people havebrought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure thanbefore.Four years ago we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions aboutgovernment and its place in our lives. Out of that change has come greatand robust growth in our confidence, our economy, and our role in theworld.Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear. Webelieve faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show ustruth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we were.Our progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of ourfamilies, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together,are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.Four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving peoplegreater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more ofwhat they earned. We did what we promised, and a great industrial giant isreborn.Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, thestrongest in 34 years; a 3 year inflation average of 3.9 percent, thelowest in 17 years; and 7.3 million new jobs in 2 years, with more of ourcitizens working than ever before.New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success:For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if (as) thefamily goes, so goes our civilization;For an America of vision that sees tomorrow\'s dreams in the learning andhard work we do today;For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet,proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom;For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out forhelp.We have begun well. But it\'s only a beginning. We\'re not here tocongratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves tofinish what has not yet been done.We\'re here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for realjobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach. We\'re here to speakfor the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industriesfighting to modernize and compete. And, yes, we\'re here to stand, andproudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, forall who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace andhuman happiness.Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish. When asked what greatprinciple holds our Union together, Abraham Lincoln said: "Something in(the) Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country,but hope to the world for all future time."We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to thedreams their vision foresaw. My fellow citizens, this nation is poised forgreatness. The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge asecond American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a revolution carryingus to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge andspace; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us tosummon greater strength than we\'ve ever known; and a revolution thatcarries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world ofpeace.Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are noconstraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, nobarriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. Already, pushingdown tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.In Europe, they\'re calling it "the American Miracle." Day by day, we\'reshattering accepted notions of what is possible. When I was growing up, wefailed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology aretransforming our lives.In the late 1950\'s workers at the AT&T semiconductor plant in Pennsylvaniaproduced five transistors a day for $7.50 apiece. They now produce over amillion for less than a penny apiece.New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cutdiagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reducehospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving humanlives.Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased workerproductivity, and is competitive once again.We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, bemore. Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it\'s getting younger andstronger. It doesn\'t need rest and supervision; it needs new challenge,greater freedom. And that word "freedom" is the key to the second Americanrevolution that we need to bring about.Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification forfairness and growth. Last year I asked Treasury Secretary then Regan todevelop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be treatedmore fairly and personal tax rates could come further down.We have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent, yet the tax system remainsunfair and limits our potential for growth. Exclusions and exemptions causesimilar incomes to be taxed at different levels. Low income families facesteep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder. The TreasuryDepartment has produced an excellent reform plan, whose principles willguide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise. Wewill not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need. Wewill reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many taxpreferences. We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent, andpossibly lower. And we will propose reducing corporate rates, whilemaintaining incentives for capital formation.To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, wewill propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totallyexempt from Federal income tax. To restore fairness to families, we willpropose increasing significantly the personal exemption.And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker I have to getused to saying that to begin working with congressional authors andcommittees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles. Wewill call upon the American people for support and upon every man and womanin this Chamber. Together, we can pass, this year, a tax bill for fairness,simplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams andAmerica the investment capital of the world. So let us begin.Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendouspent up power of our economy. But a second American revolution must carrythe promise of opportunity for all. It is time to liberate the spirit ofenterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need. Butpolicies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroyself respect are not progressive; they\'re reactionary. Despite our stridesin civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have fulland equal power until they have full economic power.We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in theabandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build betterlives. This legislation is supported by a majority of you.Mr. Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation ofentrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year. And, Tip, you couldmake that a birthday present.Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wageproposal. We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate,find summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence intheir futures.We\'ll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which has anearly two thirds job placement rate. Credits in education and health carevouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.Our administration is already encouraging certain low income public housingresidents to own and manage their own dwellings. It\'s time that all publichousing residents have that opportunity of ownership.The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom. ButStates and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery,must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers togrowth.Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreadingopportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreadingfreedom.There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action ondeficit reductions. Well, the best way to reduce deficits is througheconomic growth. More businesses will be started, more investments made,more jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes. Thebest way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spendingby increasing prosperity. Each added percentage point per year of real GNPgrowth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billionover 5 years.To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lightengovernment\'s claim on our total economy. We will not do this by raisingtaxes. We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth inspending by the Federal Government. In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overallgovernment program spending will be frozen at the current level. It mustnot be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled, andunemployed will be left intact. Growth of our major health care programs,Medicare and Medicaid, will be slowed, but protections for the elderly andneedy will be preserved.Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just aswe near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professionalcorps. National security is government\'s first responsibility; so in pastyears defense spending took about half the Federal budget. Today it takesless than a third. We\'ve already reduced our planned defense expendituresby nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years and reducedprojected spending again this year.You know, we only have a military industrial complex until a time ofdanger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy. Spending for defenseis investing in things that are priceless peace and freedom.Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies. Forexample, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares,but on Amtrak taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time an Amtraktrain leaves the station, It\'s time we ended this huge Federal subsidy.Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years. Yet I know fromvisiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderlytransition to a market oriented farm economy. We can help farmers best notby expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms, keepinginterest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers toAmerican farm exports.We\'re moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste andimprove government\'s management practices. In the long run, we must protectthe taxpayers from government. And I ask again that you pass, as 32 Stateshave now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend nomore than it takes in. And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43Governors, to veto individual items in appropriation bills. SenatorMattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2 year trial run of theline item veto. I hope you\'ll pass and send that legislation to my desk.Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to atime of reckoning. Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment ofcourage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American historyforever.Sound monetary policy is key to long running economic strength andstability. We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board,seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keepinginterest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth.Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations, and deregulating the energy,transportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition,giving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices. In justone set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bringus closer to energy independence. Consistent with safety standards, we willcontinue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries, we willsoon end up legislation or send up legislation, I should say to returnConrail to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support furtherderegulation of the trucking industry.Every dollar the Federal Government does not take from us, every decisionit does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives moreabundant, our future more free.Our second American revolution will push on to new possibilities not onlyon Earth but in the next frontier of space. Despite budget restraints, wewill seek record funding for research and development.We\'ve seen the success of the space shuttle. Now we\'re going to develop apermanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise,because in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world willbe living and working together in space.In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesavingmedicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We can make crystals ofexceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies,and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.As we do all this, we\'ll continue to protect our natural resources. We willseek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program tocontinue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health andthe environment.Now, there\'s another great heritage to speak of this evening. Of all thechanges that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greaterpromise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work,and neighborhood.We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship;renewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered byour young, who are leading the way. We\'ve rediscovered that work is good inand of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter howseemingly humble our jobs. We\'ve seen a powerful new current from an oldand honorable tradition American generosity.From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food productionin Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools,and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, wehave refound our values. Private sector initiatives are crucial to ourfuture.I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religiousgroups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groupsenjoy. But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a childstands in a classroom and breathes a prayer. We ask you again, givechildren back a right they had for a century and a half or more in thiscountry.The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking ofa human life or it isn\'t. And if it is and medical technology isincreasingly showing it is it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony thatwhile some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cryout for children to adopt. We have room for these children. We can fill thecradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I ask you in theCongress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.In the area of education, we\'re returning to excellence, and again, theheroes are our people, not government. We\'re stressing basics ofdiscipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children becomecomputer smart as well. For 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of ourhigh school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3years. We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, givingparents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded forhard work and achievement through merit pay.Of all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our senseof national well being than the explosion of violent crime. One does nothave to be attacked to be a victim. The woman who must run to her car aftershopping at night is a victim. The couple draping their door with locks andchains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning woman who can\'t ride asubway home without being afraid.We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants. But shouldn\'t we feelmore compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?For the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2 years in arow. We\'ve convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well asleaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers.But we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enactproposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officersacquire in good faith. These proposals would also reform the habeas corpuslaws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority ofAmericans, the use of the death penalty where necessary.There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among usare allowed to roam free. It\'s time we restored domestic tranquility. Andwe mean to do just that.Just as we\'re positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy,we\'re poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.Our alliances are stronger than ever. Our economy is stronger than ever. Wehave resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world. And all ofthese together are a great force for peace.Since 1981 we\'ve been committed to seeking fair and verifiable armsagreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nucleararsenals. Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influencedthe Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table. Our negotiators must beable to go to that table with the united support of the American people.All of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weaponsare banned from this Earth forever.Each Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses,thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement. Your vote thisspring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve tomaintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable armsreductions.For the past 20 years we\'ve believed that no war will be launched as longas each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike. Well, Ibelieve there\'s a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war. Itis a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnucleardefense against ballistic missiles. It\'s the most hopeful possibility ofthe nuclear age. But it\'s not very well understood.Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter warin the heavens and on Earth. Now, some say the research would be expensive.Perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself. Andsome say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense systemof their own. Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours;a civil defense system, where we have almost none; and a research programcovering roughly the same areas of technology that we\'re now exploring. Andfinally some say the research will take a long time. Well, the answer tothat is: Let\'s get started.Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world\'s hopesfor peace and human progress "lie not in measures of defense or in thecontrol of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom andself government."And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedomis not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right ofall God\'s children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today. Itis in homes that freedom built. Victories against poverty are greatest andpeace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, freespeech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth.Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and tocommunicate these ideals everywhere we can. America\'s economic success isfreedom\'s success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundreddifferent nations. Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have fewresources other than the enterprise of their own people. But through lowtax rates and free markets they\'ve soared ahead of centralized economies.And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making andimplementing trade policy, and we\'ll be studying potential changes in thatprocess in the next few weeks. We\'ve seen the benefits of free trade andlived through the disasters of protectionism. Tonight I ask all our tradingpartners, developed and developing alike, to join us in a new round oftrade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen theglobal economy and to begin it in this next year.There are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World countrieswith an average per capita income of $650 a year. Many are victims ofdictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption. Let usask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistancethat fosters economic development through personal incentives to help thesepeople climb from poverty on their own.We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that\'s not innocent; nor can webe passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy cannotsucceed. Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defendthemselves and give them confidence to work for peace. And I hope that youin the Congress will understand that, dollar for dollar, securityassistance contributes as much to global security as our own defensebudget.We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faithwith those who are risking their lives on every continent, fromAfghanistan to Nicaragua to defy Soviet supported aggression and securerights which have been ours from birth.The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban Soviet blocsupport, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a freepress, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attackingneighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self defense andtotally consistent with the OAS and U.N. Charters. It is essential that theCongress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America. I wantto work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied toour own security.And tonight, I\'ve spoken of great plans and great dreams. They\'re dreams wecan make come true. Two hundred years of American history should havetaught us that nothing is impossible.Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodusthat followed the fall of Saigon. They came to the United States with nopossessions and not knowing a word of English. Ten years ago the younggirl studied hard, learned English, and finished high school in the top ofher class. And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on hercalendar. Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduatefrom the United States Military Academy at West Point. I thought you mightlike to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen.Now, there\'s someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago. She lives in theinner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroinaddicts. The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped onher doorstep. She helps them with love. Go to her house some night, andmaybe you\'ll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floortalking softly, soothing a child in her arms Mother Hale of Harlem, andshe, too, is an American hero.Jean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying isnew again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will,and the heart. History is asking us once again to be a force for good inthe world. Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love.Thank you, and God bless you.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:05 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Thomas P.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:Thank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening. We pausedtogether to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes. And Ihope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do: Go forward,America, and reach for the stars. We will never forget those brave seven,but we shall go forward.Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out thattonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you\'vepresided over. And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute youfor your service to Congress and country. Here\'s to you!I have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak ofunfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. I am pleased toreport the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growingstronger each day. Tonight we look out on a rising America, firm of heart,united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism. America is on the move!But it wasn\'t long ago that we looked out on a different land: lockedfactory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and interest ratesturning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant,slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very rootsof our freedom. What brought America back? The American people brought usback with quiet courage and common sense, with undying faith that in thisnation under God the future will be ours; for the future belongs to thefree.Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months ofeconomic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9million new jobs in 3 years, interest rates cut in half, inflation fallingover from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today, and a mighty river of goodworks a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone. Anddespite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain themoral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for thefuture. Family and community are the costars of this great Americancomeback. They are why we say tonight: Private values must be at the heartof public policies.What is true for families in America is true for America in the family offree nations. History is no captive of some inevitable force. History ismade by men and women of vision and courage. Tonight freedom is on themarch. The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which theworld once again turns. We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only bylifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper andcan peace among all nations be secure. Teddy Roosevelt said that a nationthat does great work lives forever. We have done well, but we cannot stopat the foothills when Everest beckons. It\'s time for America to be all thatwe can be.We speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, moresecure world. And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us forthe challenges of growth, trade, and security in the next decade and theyear 2000. And we will do it not by breaking faith with bedrock principlesbut by breaking free from failed policies. Let us begin where storm cloudsloom darkest right here in Washington, DC. This week I will send you ourdetailed proposals; tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefinegovernment\'s role: not to control, not to demand or command, not to containus, but to help in times of need and, above all, to create a ladder ofopportunity to full employment so that all Americans can climb towardeconomic power and justice on their own.But we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can\'teven pass a Federal budget. We cannot win that race held back byhorse and buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander humanpotential. We cannot win that race if we\'re swamped in a sea of red ink.Now, Mr. Speaker, you know, I know, and the American people know theFederal budget system is broken. It doesn\'t work. Before we leave thiscity, let\'s you and I work together to fix it, and then we can finally givethe American people a balanced budget.Members of Congress, passage of Gramm Rudman Hollings gives us an historicopportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades:forcing the Federal Government to live within its means. Your schedule nowrequires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th, the very dayAmerica\'s families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.How often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling frompaycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxesand bills. And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised. Well, I\'msorry; they\'re asking the wrong people to tighten their belts. It\'s time wereduce the Federal budget and left the family budget alone. We do not facelarge deficits because American families are undertaxed; we face thosedeficits because the Federal Government overspends.The detailed budget that we will submit will meet the Gramm Rudman Hollingstarget for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to ensure a strongnational defense, meet our commitment to protect Social Security and thetruly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes. Howshould we accomplish this? Well, not by taking from those in need. Asfamilies take care of their own, government must provide shelter andnourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves. But we must reviseor replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade themoral worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entirecommunities into a bleak and heartless dependency. Gramm Rudman Hollingscan mark a dramatic improvement. But experience shows that simply settingdeficit targets does not assure they\'ll be met. We must proceed with Gracecommission reforms against waste.And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have: Give me aline item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I\'lltake the responsibility, I\'ll make the cuts, I\'ll take the heat. Thisauthority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spendingmeasures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit. Andyou can sustain or override my veto; that\'s the way the system should work.Once we\'ve made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains with abalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. We mustmeet it. Defense is not just another budget expense. Keeping Americastrong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the FederalGovernment; it is government\'s prime responsibility. We have devoted 5years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect, andwe\'ve made important gains. Yet the threat from Soviet forces, conventionaland strategic, from the Soviet drive for domination, from the increase inespionage and state terror remains great. This is reality. Closing our eyeswill not make reality disappear. We pledged together to hold real growth indefense spending to the bare minimum. My budget honors that pledge, and I\'mnow asking you, the Congress, to keep its end of the bargain. The Sovietsmust know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of areduced threat, not a reduced resolve.Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controllingFederal spending is to our economic security. But, as I have said before,the most powerful force we can enlist against the Federal deficit is anever expanding American economy, unfettered and free. The magic ofopportunity unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained isn\'t this the callingthat unites us? I believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done moreto spur a spirit of risk taking and help America\'s economy break free thanany program since John Kennedy\'s tax cut almost a quarter century ago.Now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic taxreform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay theirfair share, but no more. We\'ve come this far. Will you join me now, andwe\'ll walk this last mile together? You know my views on this. We cannotand we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise. Truereform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a toppersonal rate no higher than 35 percent. True reform must be truly fair,and that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000. True reform means atax system that at long last is profamily, projobs, profuture, andpro America.As we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts forfreer and fairer trade. We have already taken actions to counter unfairtrading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets. We will continueto do so. We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protectionthat in reality pits one American worker against another, one industryagainst another, one community against another, and that raises prices forus all. If the United States can trade with other nations on a levelplaying field, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anywherein the world.The constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound andstable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world. We mustnever again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and otherexporters. Farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwisegovernment policies. They must not be abandoned with problems they did notcreate and cannot control. We\'ve begun coordinating economic and monetarypolicy among our major trading partners. But there\'s more to do, andtonight I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine if thenations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship ofour currencies.Confident in our future and secure in our values, Americans are strivingforward to embrace the future. We see it not only in our recovery but in 3straight years of falling crime rates, as families and communities bandtogether to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness and to give back totheir children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they deserve. We seeit in the renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for 3 years lastyear\'s increase, the greatest since 1963. It wasn\'t government andWashington lobbies that turned education around; it was the American peoplewho, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to basics. We mustcontinue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools, vouchers thatgive parents freedom of choice; and we must give back to our children theirlost right to acknowledge God in their classrooms.We are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our nationalconscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to lifegranted by our Creator is denied to the unborn. For the rest of my time, Ishall do what I can to see that this wound is one day healed.As we work to make the American dream real for all, we must also look tothe condition of America\'s families. Struggling parents today worry howthey will provide their children the advantages that their parents gavethem. In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basicsupport system, has reached crisis proportions in female and childpoverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools.After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight ofthe poor grows more painful. But the waste in dollars and cents palesbefore the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human spirit andpotential. We can ignore this terrible truth no longer. As FranklinRoosevelt warned 51 years ago, standing before this Chamber, he said,"Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit." And wemust now escape the spider\'s web of dependency.Tonight I am charging the White House Domestic Council to present me byDecember 1, 1986, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediateaction to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns ofpoor families. I\'m talking about real and lasting emancipation, because thesuccess of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients becomeindependent of welfare. Further, after seeing how devastating illness candestroy the financial security of the family, I am directing the Secretaryof Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen, to report to me by year endwith recommendations on how the private sector and government can worktogether to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whoselife savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illnessstrikes.And tonight I want to speak directly to America\'s younger generation,because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands. With all thetemptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of thepermissive society requires superhuman feats of self control. But the callof the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in theblind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair. Never has there been amore exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroicachievement. As they said in the film "Back to the Future," "Where we\'regoing, we don\'t need roads."Well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms ofsubatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. Astronomersbuild a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe andpossibly back to the moment of creation. So, yes, this nation remains fullycommitted to America\'s space program. We\'re going forward with our shuttleflights. We\'re going forward to build our space station. And we are goingforward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by the end of thenext decade, take off from Dulles Airport, accelerate up to 25 times thespeed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within 2hours. And the same technology transforming our lives can solve thegreatest problem of the 20th century. A security shield can one day rendernuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclearterror. America met one historic challenge and went to the Moon. NowAmerica must meet another: to make our strategic defense real for all thecitizens of planet Earth.Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future: to leave our children aland that is free and just and a world at peace. It is my hope that ourfireside summit in Geneva and Mr. Gorbachev\'s upcoming visit to America canlead to a more stable relationship. Surely no people on Earth hate war orlove peace more than we Americans. But we cannot stroll into the futurewith childlike faith. Our differences with a system that openly proclaimsand practices an alleged right to command people\'s lives and to export itsideology by force are deep and abiding. Logic and history compel us toaccept that our relationship be guided by realism rock hard, cleareyed,steady, and sure. Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut inoffensive forces by each side with no cheating. They have made clear thatSoviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential. Ifthe Soviet Government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms,there will be such an agreement.But arms control is no substitute for peace. We know that peace follows infreedom\'s path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.So, we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but bybolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can.We advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf oflower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world. Westrengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come tothe aid of friends under siege. And we can enlarge the family of freenations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all God\'s children tofollow their dreams.To those imprisoned in regimes held captive, to those beaten for daring tofight for freedom and democracy for their right to worship, to speak, tolive, and to prosper in the family of free nations we say to you tonight:You are not alone, freedom fighters. America will support with moral andmaterial assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but tofight and win freedom to win freedom in Afghanistan, in Angola, inCambodia, and in Nicaragua. This is a great moral challenge for the entirefree world.Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for thesecurity of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, thanto achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua\'s democraticneighbors. This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do whatmust be done for that great and good cause. As (former Senator HenryM.)Scoop Jackson, the inspiration for our Bipartisan Commission on CentralAmerica, once said, "In matters of national security, the best politics isno politics."What we accomplish this year, in each challenge we face, will set ourcourse for the balance of the decade, indeed, for the remainder of thecentury. After all we\'ve done so far, let no one say that this nationcannot reach the destiny of our dreams. America believes, America is ready,America can win the race to the future and we shall. The American dream isa song of hope that rings through night winter air; vivid, tender musicthat warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatestthings: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new beauty in music,literature, and art; to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chipor a single human cell.We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.All his life he\'s been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine. And,Richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school waslaunched and lost last week, yet your dream lives. And as long as it\'sreal, work of noble note will yet be done, work that could reduce theharmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view thegolden gateways of the farthest stars.We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12 year old, Tyrone Ford.A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity tobecome an accomplished pianist and singer. He also directs the choirs ofthree churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center. With God as yourcomposer, Tyrone, your music will be the music of angels.We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13 year old ShelbyButler, honor student and member of her school\'s safety patrol. Seeinganother girl freeze in terror before an out of control school bus, sherisked her life and pulled her to safety. With bravery like yours, Shelby,America need never fear for our future.And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old,Trevor Ferrell. Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women bedding downin abandoned doorways on television he was watching Trevor left hissuburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless andhomeless. And now 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil. Trevor,yours is the living spirit of brotherly love.Would you four stand up for a moment? Thank you, thank you. You are heroesof our hearts. We look at you and know it\'s true: In this land of dreamsfulfilled, where greater dreams may be imagined, nothing is impossible, novictory is beyond our reach, no glory will ever be too great.So, now it\'s up to us, all of us, to prepare America for that day when ourwork will pale before the greatness of America\'s champions in the 21stcentury. The world\'s hopes rest with America\'s future; America\'s hopes restwith us. So, let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, inunity, and in love.God bless you, and God bless America.NOTE: The President spoke at 8:04 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Thomas P. O\'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radioand television.
Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honoredguests, and fellow citizens:May I congratulate all of you who are Members of this historic 100thCongress of the United States of America. In this 200th anniversary year ofour Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants men whosewords and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom. However, we must alwaysremember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, butfor being young young with the same energy, spirit, and promise thatfilled each eventful day in Philadelphia\'s statehouse. We will be guidedtonight by their acts, and we will be guided forever by their words.Now, forgive me, but I can\'t resist sharing a story from those historicdays. Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, andits newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the Convention delegateswith elaborate social classifications. Governors of States were calledExcellency. Justices and Chancellors had reserved for them honorable with acapital "H." For Congressmen, it was honorable with a small "h." And allothers were referred to as "the following respectable characters." Well,for this 100th Congress, I invoke special executive powers to declare thateach of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital "H."Incidentally, I\'m delighted you are celebrating the 100th birthday of theCongress. It\'s always a pleasure to congratulate someone with morebirthdays than I\'ve had.Now, there\'s a new face at this place of honor tonight. And please join mein warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright. Mr.Speaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session ofCongress 32 years ago. Then, as now, the speakership had changed hands andanother great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn "Mr. Sam" sat in your chair. Icannot find better words than those used by President Eisenhower thatevening. He said, "We shall have much to do together; I am sure that wewill get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and good will." TonightI renew that pledge. To you, Mr. Speaker, and to Senate Majority LeaderRobert Byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the Congress,may I say: Though there are changes in the Congress, America\'s interestsremain the same. And I am confident that, along with Republican leaders BobMichel and Bob Dole, this Congress can make history.Six years ago I was here to ask the Congress to join me in America\'s newbeginning. Well, the results are something of which we can all be proud.Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century. The primeinterest rate has fallen from the 21 1/2 percent the month before we tookoffice to 7 1/2 percent today. And those rates have triggered the mosthousing starts in 8 years. The unemployment rate still too high is thelowest in nearly 7 years, and our people have created nearly 13 million newjobs. Over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16, male and female, isemployed the highest percentage on record. Let\'s roll up our sleeves andgo to work and put America\'s economic engine at full throttle. We can alsobe heartened by our progress across the world. Most important, America isat peace tonight, and freedom is on the march. And we\'ve done much thesepast years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership inthe world. Our sons and daughters in the services once again wear theiruniforms with pride.But though we\'ve made much progress, I have one major regret: I took a riskwith regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I assumefull responsibility. The goals were worthy. I do not believe it was wrongto try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or totry to save lives. And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedomfor our citizens held in barbaric captivity. But we did not achieve what wewished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get tothe bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for. But indebating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future.Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became soobsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further thecause of peace and freedom in the world. Much is at stake here, and theNation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in thenational interest or if we let partisanship weaken us. And let there be nomistake about American policy: We will not sit idly by if our interests orour friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield toterrorist blackmail.And now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don\'t we get to work? Iam pleased to report that because of our efforts to rebuild the strength ofAmerica, the world is a safer place. Earlier this month I submitted abudget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglectin the last decade. Well, I ask you to vote out a defense and foreignaffairs budget that says yes to protecting our country. While the world issafer, it is not safe.Since 1970 the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their militaryforces than we have. Even today, though nearly 1 in 3 Soviet families iswithout running hot water and the average family spends 2 hours a dayshopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still foundthe resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in thepast 5 years clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia,Afghanistan, and Nicaragua. With 120,000 Soviet combat and militarypersonnel and 15,000 military advisers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,can anyone still doubt their single minded determination to expand theirpower? Despite this, the Congress cut my request for critical U.S. securityassistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defenserequests by $85 billion in the last 3 years.These assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutualinterests. And when the programs are devastated, American interests areharmed. My friends, it\'s my duty as President to say to you again tonightthat there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve. Todaythe brave people of Afghanistan are showing that resolve. The Soviet Unionsays it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet it continues abrutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. We areready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawalof all Soviet troops and genuine self determination for the Afghan people.In Central America, too, the cause of freedom is being tested. And ourresolve is being tested there as well. Here, especially, the world iswatching to see how this nation responds. Today over 90 percent of thepeople of Latin America live in democracy. Democracy is on the march inCentral and South America. Communist Nicaragua is the odd manout suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent andpromoting subversion in the region. We support diplomatic efforts, butthese efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war againstthe Nicaraguan people.Our commitment to a Western Hemisphere safe from aggression did not occurby spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. It began with theMonroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan Americanpolicy. Franklin Roosevelt said we "are determined to do everythingpossible to maintain peace on this hemisphere." President Truman was veryblunt: "International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroythe independence of the Americas. We cannot let that happen here." And JohnF. Kennedy made clear that "Communist domination in this hemisphere cannever be negotiated." Some in this Congress may choose to depart from thishistoric commitment, but I will not.This year we celebrate the second century of our Constitution. TheSandinistas just signed theirs 2 weeks ago, and then suspended it. We won\'tknow how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason:There is no free press in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan freedom fighters have neverasked us to wage their battle, but I will fight any effort to shut offtheir lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life withoutfreedom. There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America.You know, we Americans have always preferred dialog to conflict, and so, wealways remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union.But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element ofthe U.S. Soviet agenda. Progress is also required on the other items of ouragenda as well real respect for human rights and more open contactsbetween our societies and, of course, arms reduction.In Iceland, last October, we had one moment of opportunity that the Sovietsdashed because they sought to cripple our Strategic Defense Initiative,SDI. I wouldn\'t let them do it then; I won\'t let them do it now or in thefuture. This is the most positive and promising defense program we haveundertaken. It\'s the path, for both sides, to a safer future a system thatdefends human life instead of threatening it. SDI will go forward. TheUnited States has made serious, fair, and far reaching proposals to theSoviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction.But I will need, and American negotiators in Geneva will need, Congress\'support. Enacting the Soviet negotiating position into American law wouldnot be the way to win a good agreement. So, I must tell you in thisCongress I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security andour negotiating leverage.Now, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerceacross the world. We will work to expand our opportunities in internationalmarkets through the Uruguay round of trade negotiations and to complete anhistoric free trade arrangement between the world\'s two largest tradingpartners, Canada and the United States. Our basic trade policy remains thesame: We remain opposed as ever to protectionism, because America\'s growthand future depend on trade. But we would insist on trade that is fair andfree. We are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies.Now, from foreign borders let us return to our own, because America in theworld is only as strong as America at home. This 100th Congress has highresponsibilities. I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these aresimply the incomplete obligations of the past. The American people deserveto be impatient, because we do not yet have the public house in order.We\'ve had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we\'verescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the Depression. Butthere\'s more to do. For starters, the Federal deficit is outrageous. Foryears I\'ve asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of ourgovernment. And what the Congress finally needs to do is pass aconstitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forcesgovernment to live within its means. States, cities, and the families ofAmerica balance their budgets. Why can\'t we?Next, the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing of deadlines andthe nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds ofbillions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. We ask theCongress once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have alineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork, those itemsthat would never survive on their own. I will send the Congress broadrecommendations on the budget, but first I\'d like to see yours. Let\'s go towork and get this done together.But now let\'s talk about this year\'s budget. Even though I have submittedit within the Gramm Rudman Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seensuggestions that we might postpone that timetable. Well, I think theAmerican people are tired of hearing the same old excuses. Together we madea commitment to balance the budget. Now let\'s keep it. As for thosesuggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the American people haverepeatedly rejected that shop worn advice. They know that we don\'t havedeficits because people are taxed too little. We have deficits because biggovernment spends too much.Now, next month I\'ll place two additional reforms before the Congress.We\'ve created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our senseof priorities. Our national welfare system consists of some 59 majorprograms and over 6,000 pages of Federal laws and regulations on which morethan $132 billion was spent in 1985. I will propose a new national welfarestrategy, a program of welfare reform through State sponsored,community based demonstration projects. This is the time to reform thisoutmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap. Now, we willnever abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.But let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfareand made self supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipientswant more than anything else. Next, let us remove a financial specterfacing our older Americans: the fear of an illness so expensive that it canresult in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy anddeath. I will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from thefear of catastrophic illness.Now let\'s turn to the future. It\'s widely said that America is losing hercompetitive edge. Well, that won\'t happen if we act now. How well preparedare we to enter the 21st century? In my lifetime, America set the standardfor the world. It is now time to determine that we should enter the nextcentury having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history. Wewill achieve this, first, by guaranteeing that government does everythingpossible to promote America\'s ability to compete. Second, we must act asindividuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by newproposals or billions in new funding. Rather, it involves an expenditure ofAmerican spirit and just plain American grit. The Congress will soonreceive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness,including new science and technology centers and strong new funding forbasic research. The bill will include legal and regulatory reforms andweapons to fight unfair trade practices. Competitiveness also means givingour farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing worldmarket.Preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children. We needto set for them new and more rigorous goals. We must demand more ofourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by theyear 2000. Our children should master the basic concepts of math andscience, and let\'s insist that students not leave high school until theyhave studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage.There\'s one more thing we can\'t let up on: Let\'s redouble our personalefforts to provide for every child a safe and drug free learningenvironment. If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, wewill defeat that scourge all over the country.Finally, let\'s stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being.Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help. Why is itthat we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can\'t use a schoolroomfor voluntary prayer? The 100th Congress of the United States should beremembered as the one that ended the expulsion of God from America\'sclassrooms.The quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom butmust go next to the workplace. More than 20 million new jobs will becreated before the new century unfolds, and by then, our economy should beable to provide a job for everyone who wants to work. We must also enableour workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace. And Iwill propose substantial, new Federal commitments keyed to retraining andjob mobility.Over the next few weeks, I\'ll be sending the Congress a complete series ofthese special messages on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness,including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture,and other subjects. The Congress can give us these tools, but to make thesetools work, it really comes down to just being our best. And that is thecore of American greatness. The responsibility of freedom presses ustowards higher knowledge and, I believe, moral and spiritual greatness.Through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways offreeing people\'s spirits. But only we, each of us, can let the spirit soaragainst our own individual standards. Excellence is what makes freedomring. And isn\'t that what we do best?We\'re entering our third century now, but it\'s wrong to judge our nation byits years. The calendar can\'t measure America because we were meant to bean endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reaches, noboundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes. The United StatesConstitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travelthrough history. It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of ourexistence: that we are here to serve Him by living free that living freereleases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities; thatwe would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would securethem not just for ourselves and for our children but for all mankind.Over the years I won\'t count if you don\'t nothing has been soheartwarming to me as speaking to America\'s young, and the little onesespecially, so fresh faced and so eager to know. Well, from time to timeI\'ve been with them they will ask about our Constitution. And I hope youMembers of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you\'llpermit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might belistening or watching this evening. I\'ve read the constitutions of a numberof countries, including the Soviet Union\'s. Now, some people are surprisedto hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants anumber of freedoms to its people. Many countries have written into theirconstitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.Well, if this is true, why is the Constitution of the United States soexceptional?Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it\'s sogreat it tells you the whole story in just three words: We the people. Inthose other constitutions, the Government tells the people of thosecountries what they\'re allowed to do. In our Constitution, we the peopletell the Government what it can do, and it can do only those things listedin that document and no others. Virtually every other revolution in historyhas just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. Ourrevolution is the first to say the people are the masters and government istheir servant. And you young people out there, don\'t ever forget that.Someday you could be in this room, but wherever you are, America isdepending on you to reach your highest and be your best because here inAmerica, we the people are in charge.Just three words: We the people those are the kids on Christmas Daylooking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea oraboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. A million miles from home,but doing their duty.We the people those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can\'t begin tocount, who\'ll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they willnever know and MIA families they will never meet. Why? Because that\'s theway we are, this unique breed we call Americans.We the people they\'re farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding ahungry world. They\'re the volunteers at the hospital choking back theirtears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life becauseof a mother who used drugs. And you\'ll forgive me a special memory it\'s amillion mothers like Nelle Reagan who never knew a stranger or turned ahungry person away from her kitchen door.We the people they refute last week\'s television commentary downgradingour optimism and our idealism. They are the entrepreneurs, the builders,the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks the true heroes of our land whomake up the most uncommon nation of doers in history. You know they\'reAmericans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their heartsare bigger than their spirits.We the people starting the third century of a dream and standing up tosome cynic who\'s trying to tell us we\'re not going to get any better. Arewe at the end? Well, I can\'t tell it any better than the real thing astory recorded by James Madison from the final moments of theConstitutional Convention, September 17th, 1787. As the last few memberssigned the document, Benjamin Franklin the oldest delegate at 81 years andin frail health looked over toward the chair where George Washington dailypresided. At the back of the chair was painted the picture of a Sun on thehorizon. And turning to those sitting next to him, Franklin observed thatartists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between arising and a setting Sun.Well, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting aroundFranklin leaning in to listen more closely to him. And then Dr. Franklinbegan to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of theirefforts, and this is what he said: "I have often looked at that picturebehind the President without being able to tell whether it was a rising orsetting Sun: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is arising and not a setting Sun." Well, you can bet it\'s rising because, myfellow citizens, America isn\'t finished. Her best days have just begun.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives.The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.
Ronald Reagan
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House andSenate: When we first met here 7 years ago many of us for the firsttime it was with the hope of beginning something new for America. We meethere tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work. If anyoneexpects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of myadministration, I say let\'s leave that to history; we\'re not finished yet.So, my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes; we\'re still on thejob.History records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7 yearsago ideas like the individual\'s right to reach as far and as high as his orher talents will permit; the free market as an engine of economic progress.And as an ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao tzu, said: "Govern a greatnation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it." Well, these ideaswere part of a larger notion, a vision, if you will, of Americaherself an America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but anAmerica, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods; an Americawhose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deepercommunity of values: the value of work, of family, of religion, and of thelove of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense He hasentrusted in a special way to this nation.All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev washere the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankindbegan with three simple words: "We the People," the revolutionary notionthat the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around.And there\'s one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I wouldoffer to you now. Just as those who created this Republic pledged to eachother their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too,America\'s leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keepforemost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for ourparty but what is best for America.In the spirit of Jefferson, let us affirm that in this Chamber tonightthere are no Republicans, no Democrats just Americans. Yes, we will haveour differences, but let us always remember what unites us far outweighswhatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them the millions ofAmericans watching and listening tonight expect this of us. Let\'s prove tothem and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year. We\'vedone this before. And as we have worked together to bring down spending,tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; Americahas created more jobs and better, higher paying jobs; family income hasrisen for 4 straight years, and America\'s poor climbed out of poverty atthe fastest rate in more than 10 years.Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but aneconomic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth,and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sectorinitiatives and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving; a revolutionthat at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored theAmerican dream.In international relations, too, there\'s only one description for what,together, we have achieved: a complete turnabout, a revolution. Seven yearsago, America was weak, and freedom everywhere was under siege. TodayAmerica is strong, and democracy is everywhere on the move. From CentralAmerica to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms andhuman rights are taking hold. We\'ve replaced "Blame America" with "Look upto America." We\'ve rebuilt our defenses. And of all our accomplishments,none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people areagain proud to wear our country\'s uniform.And in a few moments, I\'m going to talk about three developments armsreduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democraticrevolution that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would havedared imagine 7 years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two greatnightmares of the postwar era. I speak of the startling hope of giving ourchildren a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.Tonight, then, we\'re strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. This isthe state of our Union. And if we will work together this year, I believewe can give a future President and a future Congress the chance to makethat prosperity, that peace, that freedom not just the state of our Unionbut the state of our world.Toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. First, steps we cantake this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our childrena future of low inflation and full employment. Second, let\'s check ourprogress in attacking social problems, where important gains have beenmade, but which still need critical attention. I mean schools that work,economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life andfamily values. Our third objective tonight is global: continuing theexciting economic and democratic revolutions we\'ve seen around the world.Fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decadeand a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and worldfreedom. We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the nextPresident inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give thatPresident: a national security that is unassailable and a national defensethat takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded.This is a full agenda. It\'s meant to be. You see, my thinking on the nextyear is quite simple: Let\'s make this the best of 8. And that means it\'sall out right to the finish line. I don\'t buy the idea that this is thelast year of anything, because we\'re not talking here tonight aboutregistering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes. Andthat\'s why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that madeAmerica great. Let\'s be clear on this point. We\'re for limited government,because we understand, as the Founding Fathers did, that it is the best wayof ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that everyAmerican of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of Americanprosperity and freedom.One other thing we Americans like the future like the sound of it, theidea of it, the hope of it. Where others fear trade and economic growth, wesee opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed of opportunitiesfor millions in our own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw upbarriers, we seek to bring them down. Where others take counsel of theirfears, we follow our hopes. Yes, we Americans like the future and likemaking the most of it. Let\'s do that now.And let\'s begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth bycontrolling and eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits. Wehave had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years. For thefirst time in 14 years, the Federal Government spent less in real termslast year than the year before. We took $73 billion off last year\'s deficitcompared to the year before. The deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percentof the gross national product to only 3.4 percent. And perhaps the mostimportant sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits. Youknow, a few of us can remember when, not too many years ago, those whocreated the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worryabout the debt, because we owe it to ourselves. Well, at last there isagreement that we can\'t spend ourselves rich.Our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce Federal deficits by $76billion over the next 2 years, builds on this consensus. But this agreementmust be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past: morebroken promises and more unchecked spending. As I indicated in my firstState of the Union, what ails us can be simply put: The Federal Governmentis too big, and it spends too much money. I can assure you, the bipartisanleadership of Congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust ourbudget agreement. And this includes the swift and certain use of the vetopower.Now, it\'s also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacleto controlling Federal deficits. The simple but frustrating problem ofmaking expenses match revenues something American families do and theFederal Government can\'t has caused crisis after crisis in this city. Mr.Speaker, Mr. President, I will say to you tonight what I have said beforeand will continue to say: The budget process has broken down; it needs adrastic overhaul. With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the Americanpeople is the same as it was this Christmas: budget deadlines delayed ormissed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds ofbillions of dollars worth of spending into one bill, and a FederalGovernment on the brink of default.I know I\'m echoing what you here in the Congress have said, because yousuffered so directly. But let\'s recall that in 7 years, of 91appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only10 made it on time. Last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due byOctober 1st, none of them made it. Instead, we had four continuingresolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and 2 days, and 3 days,respectively.And then, along came these behemoths. This is the conference report 1,053pages, report weighing 14 pounds. Then this a reconciliation bill 6 monthslate that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds. And the long termcontinuing resolution this one was 2 months late, and it\'s 1,057 pageslong, weighing 14 pounds. That was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink.You had 3 hours yes, 3 hours to consider each, and it took 300 people atmy Office of Management and Budget just to read the bill so the Governmentwouldn\'t shut down. Congress shouldn\'t send another one of these. No, andif you do, I will not sign it.Let\'s change all this. Instead of a Presidential budget that gets discardedand a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not asimple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending prioritieswithin the available revenues? And let\'s remember our deadline is October1st, not Christmas. Let\'s get the people\'s work done in time to avoid afootrace with Santa Claus. And, yes, this year to coin a phrase a newbeginning: 13 individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by Congress.I\'m also certain you join me in saying: Let\'s help ensure our future ofprosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get touse it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must have. Give thePresident the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States: theright to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, andenforce budget discipline. Let\'s approve the line item veto.And let\'s take a partial step in this direction. Most of you in thisChamber didn\'t know what was in this catchall bill and report. Over thepast few weeks, we\'ve all learned what was tucked away behind a littlecomma here and there. For example, there\'s millions for items such ascranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and thecommercialization of wildflowers. And that\'s not to mention the five or somillion ($.5 million) that so that people from developing nations couldcome here to watch Congress at work. I won\'t even touch that. So, tonight Ioffer you this challenge. In 30 days I will send back to you those items asrescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.Now, review this multibillion dollar package that will not undercut ourbipartisan budget agreement. As a matter of fact, if adopted, it willimprove our deficit reduction goals. And what an example we can set, thatwe\'re serious about getting our financial accounts in order. By acting andapproving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressionalprocess that is out of control.There is another vital reform. Yes, Gramm Rudman Hollings has beenprofoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and makeit permanent. Let us do now what so many States do to hold down spendingand what 32 State legislatures have asked us to do. Let us heed the wishesof an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a constitutionalamendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the Federal Governmentto live within its means. Reform of the budget process including theline item veto and balanced budget amendment will, together with realrestraint on government spending, prevent the Federal budget from everagain ravaging the family budget.Let\'s ensure that the Federal Government never again legislates against thefamily and the home. Last September 1 signed an Executive order on thefamily requiring that every department and agency review its activities inlight of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family. Butlet us make certain that the family is always at the center of the publicpolicy process not just in this administration but in all futureadministrations. It\'s time for Congress to consider, at the beginning, astatement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit ofAmerican society, the family.And speaking of the family, let\'s turn to a matter on the mind of everyAmerican parent tonight: education. We all know the sorry story of thesixties and seventies soaring spending, plummeting test scores and thathopeful trend of the eighties, when we replaced an obsession with dollarswith a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up. There\'s alesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times: Ina child\'s education, money can never take the place of basics likediscipline, hard work, and, yes, homework.As a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education more than wespend on defense. Yet across our country, Governors like New Jersey\'s TomKean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as importantas how much we spend. Opening up the teaching profession to all qualifiedcandidates, merit pay so that good teachers get A\'s as well as apples andstronger curriculum, as Secretary Bennett has proposed for highschools these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popularnew kid in America\'s schools. How can we help? Well, we can talk about andpush for these reforms. But the most important thing we can do is toreaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the States, localcommunities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers.My friends, some years ago, the Federal Government declared war on poverty,and poverty won. Today the Federal Government has 59 major welfare programsand spends more than $100 billion a year on them. What has all this moneydone? Well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. Federalwelfare programs have created a massive social problem. With the best ofintentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the verysupport system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty: thefamily. Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from onegeneration to the next, of too many fragmented families.It is time this may be the most radical thing I\'ve said in 7 years in thisoffice it\'s time for Washington to show a little humility. There are athousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities aroundthe Nation. It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fireand become guiding lights. States have begun to show us the way. They\'vedemonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around moreeffective child support enforcement practices and innovative programsrequiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. Let us give theStates more flexibility and encourage more reforms. Let\'s start making ourwelfare system the first rung on America\'s ladder of opportunity, a boostup from dependency, not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope.And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and thequality of family life. The first is an untold American success story.Recently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high schoolseniors have to say about drugs. Cocaine use is declining, and marijuanause was the lowest since surveying began. We can be proud that our studentsare just saying no to drugs. But let us remember what this menace requires:commitment from every part of America and every single American, acommitment to a drugfree America. The war against drugs is a war ofindividual battles, a crusade with many heroes, including America\'s youngpeople and also someone very special to me. She has helped so many of ouryoung people to say no to drugs. Nancy, much credit belongs to you, and Iwant to express to you your husband\'s pride and your country\'s thanks.\'.Surprised you, didn\'t I?Well, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage toconfront. Tonight, I call America a good nation, a moral people tocharitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion ondemand. To those who say this violates a woman\'s right to control of herown body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn childis a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislationthat would stop all Federal funding for abortion and with a human lifeamendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatensthe life of the mother. Our Judeo Christian tradition recognizes the rightof taking a life in self defense. But with that one exception, let us lookto those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. I pledge toyou tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend fullsharing in family life to millions of Americans so that children who needhomes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them.And let me add here: So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded usthat spiritual values alone are essential to our nation\'s health and vigor.The Congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the Supreme Court,with an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being. Yet we are denied the right toset aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray. Ibelieve Congress should pass our school prayer amendment.Now, to make sure there is a full nine member Supreme Court to interpretthe law, to protect the rights of all Americans, I urge the Senate to movequickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highestCourt in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fillvacancies in the Federal judiciary.Here then are our domestic priorities. Yet if the Congress and theadministration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead toexpand a growing world economy, to continue to reduce the threat of nucleararms, and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democraticinstitutions.Our policies consistently received the strongest support of the lateCongressman Dan Daniel of Virginia. I\'m sure all of you join me inexpressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the worldis to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. A creative,competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars thatwould close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs.We should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism. America\'s jobs,America\'s growth, America\'s future depend on trade trade that is free,open, and fair.This year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward agrowing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches toall the free nations of this Earth. I\'m speaking of the historic free tradeagreement negotiated between our country and Canada. And I can also tellyou that we\'re determined to expand this concept, south as well as north.Next month I will be traveling to Mexico, where trade matters will be offoremost concern. And over the next several months, our Congress and theCanadian Parliament can make the start of such a North American accord areality. Our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade, from the tipof Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle, unites the people of the WesternHemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange, when all bordersbecome what the U.S. Canadian border so long has been: a meeting placerather than a dividing line.This movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom isindivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom andagainst totalitarian rule. This global democratic revolution has removedthe specter, so frightening a decade ago, of democracy doomed to permanentminority status in the world. In South and Central America, only a third ofthe people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976. Today over 90 percent of LatinAmericans live in nations committed to democratic principles. And theresurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost everycontinent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny.In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning, because that nation is so nearour own borders. The recent revelations of a former high level Sandinistamajor, Roger Miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace, the CommunistSandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large600,000 man army. Yet even as these plans are made, the Sandinista regimeknows the tide is turning, and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding atits crest. Because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting Communistrule, the Sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights,negotiate with church authorities, and release a few political prisoners.The focus is on the Sandinistas, their promises and their actions. There isa consensus among the four Central American democratic Presidents that theSandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy toall of Central America. The Sandinistas again have promised reforms. Theirchallenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy. On Wednesday myrequest to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted, which reflectsour mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in Nicaragua. I askCongress to pass this request. Let us be for the people of Nicaragua whatLafayette, Pulaski, and Von Steuben were for our forefathers and the causeof American independence.So, too, in Afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace. Wesupport the Mujahidin. There can be no settlement unless all Soviet troopsare removed and the Afghan people are allowed genuine self determination. Ihave made my views on this matter known to Mr. Gorbachev. But not justNicaragua or Afghanistan yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tideacross the world: freedom fighters rising up in Cambodia and Angola,fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred. Theircause is our cause: freedom.Yet even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peaceand reduce the danger of nuclear war. But let\'s have no illusions. Threeyears of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment haveincreased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizingearlier hard won goals. We must face squarely the implications of thisnegative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal boththis year and in the future.This same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs aswell. But the resolve of America and its NATO allies has opened the way forunprecedented achievement in arms reduction. Our recently signed INF treatyis historic, because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the moststringent verification regime in arms control history, including severalforms of short notice, on site inspection. I submitted the treaty today,and I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification ofthis landmark agreement. Thank you very much.In addition to the INF treaty, we\'re within reach of an even moresignificant START agreement that will reduce U.S. and Soviet long rangemissile or strategic arsenals by half. But let me be clear. Our approachis not to seek agreement for agreement\'s sake but to settle only foragreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies.We will never put our security at risk or that of our allies just to reachan agreement with the Soviets. No agreement is better than a badagreement.As I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what wenever had a future free of nuclear terror. Reduction of strategicoffensive arms is one step, SDI another. Our funding request for ourStrategic Defense Initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defensebudget. SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent. SDIhas the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction. Itreduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind.Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, morestable basis for deterrence. We must also remember that SDI is ourinsurance policy against a nuclear accident, a Chernobyl of the sky, or anaccidental launch or some madman who might come along.We\'ve seen such changes in the world in 7 years. As totalitarianismstruggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance andthe aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilientand resurgent. As the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianismon the defensive, we have left behind the days of retreat. America is againa vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively andfirmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests. No legacywould make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus forthe cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis ofAmerican power from ever occurring again.But my thoughts tonight go beyond this, and I hope you\'ll let me end thisevening with a personal reflection. You know, the world could never bequite the same again after Jacob Shallus, a trustworthy and dependableclerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and engrossedthose words about representative government in the preamble of ourConstitution. And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events wasforever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike in anobscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke of our duty togovernment of and by the people and never letting it perish from theEarth.At the start of this decade, I suggested that we live in equally momentoustimes, that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of governmentwould endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for aquiet, pleasant, greening land called America. Not everything has been madeperfect in 7 years, nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years,but before us, this year and beyond, are great prospects for the cause ofpeace and world freedom.It means, too, that the young Americans I spoke of 7 years ago, as well asthose who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores this nightand seeing for the first time the lights of this Capital City the lightsthat cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments tothe memory of our great men it means those young Americans will find acity of hope in a land that is free.We can be proud that for them and for us, as those lights along the Potomacare still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two centuriesand as we pray God they always will, that another generation of Americanshas protected and passed on lovingly this place called America, thisshining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people.Thank you, and God bless you.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:07 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.He was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives.The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.
George W. Bush
To the Congress of the United States:Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress:It is a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approachfor governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak heretonight. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to cometo the White House to discuss important issues. We are off to a good start. Iwill continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind andcandid, and I thank you for making a new President feel welcome.The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the steps ofthis building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws, and I asked you tojoin me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington. I hope Americais noticing the difference. We are making progress. Together, we are changingthe tone of our Nations capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation isvitalbecause in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how wesay it, but by what we are able to accomplish.America today is a nation with great challengesbut greater resources. An artistusing statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of ourcountry. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices,too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism.Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, amilitary that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors,technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength,concerned citizens who care for our country and for each other. Neither pictureis complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress towork with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the otherto directthe advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people.Some of these resources will come from governmentsome, but not all. Year afteryear in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument:on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on theother, those who want less government, regardless of the need.We should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a differentcourse. Government has a role, and an important one. Yet too much governmentcrowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy.Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited, engaged,but not overbearing. My budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable andit is responsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. Weincrease spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and otherentitlement programs by $81 billion. We have increased spending fordiscretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate ofinflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt, andthen when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earnedit in the first place.A budgets impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellentschools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, astronger defensethese are all important needs and we fund them.The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our childrenseducation. Education is my top priority and by supporting this budget, you willmake it yours as well. Reading is the foundation of all learning, so during thenext 5 years, we triple spending, adding another $5 billion to help every childin America learn to read. Values are important, so we have tripled funding forcharacter education to teach our children not only reading and writing, butright from wrong.We have increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a goodeducation starts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in thiseffort. I like teachers so much, I married one. Please help me salute ourgracious First Lady, Laura Bush.Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that willshape our future: teaching. Laura will travel across America, to promote soundteaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs suchas Head Start.When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference.Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higherstandards and accountability for results.I believe in local control of schools: we should not and we will not run ourpublic schools from Washington. Yet when the Federal Government spends taxdollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic readingand math skills every year, between grades three and eight. Measuring is theonly way to know whether all our children are learningand I want to know,because I refuse to leave any child behind.Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk aboutteaching to the test. But let us put that logic to the test. If you testchildren on basic math and reading skills, and you are teaching to the test,you are teaching . . . math and reading. And that is the whole idea.As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So wemust streamline the dozens of Federal education programs into five and letStates spend money in those categories as they see fit.Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the support to do so.Yet if they do not, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and studentsdifferent optionsa better public school, a private school, tutoring, or acharter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given abetter choice, because when it comes to our children, failure is not an option.Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare andSocial Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs ofall Americas seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years.My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund allcurrent programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for lowincomeseniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buying food andbuying prescriptions. To make sure the retirement savings of Americas seniorsare not diverted to any other programmy budget protects all $2.6 trillion ofthe Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social Security alone.My budget puts a priority on access to health carewithout telling Americanswhat doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many workingAmericans do not have health care coverage. We will help them buy their owninsurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low incomeneighborhoods, over the next 5 years we will double the number of people servedat community health care centers. And we will address the concerns of those whohave health coverage yet worry their insurance company does not care and willnot pay. Together, this Congress and this President will find common ground tomake sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care theydeserve with a Patients Bill of Rights. When it comes to their health, peoplewant to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court becausethey did not get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those withlegitimate claims, but first, let us put in place a strong independent review sowe promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to manywho struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your ownwho is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a fine representative and a goodman, Congressman JOE MOAKLEY. God bless you, JOE. And I can think of no moreappropriate tribute to JOE than to have the Congress finish the job of doublingthe budget for the National Institutes of Health. My New Freedom Initiative forAmericans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities towork, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 millionAmericans with disabilities, we must continue to break down barriers toequality.The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strongand free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I amrequesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health careand housing. Our men and women in uniform give America their best and we owethem our support. Americas veterans honored their commitment to our countrythrough their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with abillion dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and fasterdecisions on benefit claims.My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxicBrownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fullyfunding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our National Parks have a specialplace in our countrys life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty andhistory. As good stewards, we must leave them better than we have found them, soI propose providing $4.9 billion in resources over 5 years for the upkeep ofthese national treasures.And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and disadvantaged.We must encourage and support the work of charities and faithbased and communitygroups that offer help and love one person at a time. These groups are workingin every neighborhood in America, to fight homelessness and addiction anddomestic violence, to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for ourchildren. Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, notdiscriminate against them.Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. And government shouldnot fund religious activities. But our Nations should support the good works ofthese good people who are helping neighbors in need. So I am proposing allowingall taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitablecontributions. Estimates show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a yearin new charitable givingmoney that will save and change lives.Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a FederalCompassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to provide a mentor tothe more than 1 million children with a parent in prison, and to support otherlocal efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction, and otherdifficult problems. With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help mewelcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith based and communityorganizations to make a difference in Philadelphia and he has invited me to hiscity this summer, to see compassion in action.I am personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street is aDemocrat. Let the record show that I lost his city. But some things are biggerthan politics. So I look forward to coming to your city to see your faithbasedprograms in action.As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of ourcitizens have cause to doubt our Nations justice when the law points a fingerof suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All our citizens are createdequal and must be treated equally. Earlier today I asked Attorney GeneralAshcroft to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It iswrong. We must end it. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our Nationsbrave police officers. They protect us every day, often at great risk. But bystopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our policeofficers earn and deserve.My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations, it hasfunded our Nations important priorities, it has protected Social Security andMedicare, and our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I havelistened, and I agree.My budget proposal pays down an unprecedented amount of public debt. We owe itto our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to paydown $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years.At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that isavailable to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever beenrepaid by any nation at any time in history.We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future.We should approach our Nations budget as any prudent family would, with acontingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs.For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending,we may need additional money for our farmers, or additional money to reformMedicare. And so my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 yearsfor additional needs . . . that is one trillion additional reasons you can feelcomfortable supporting this budget. We have increased our budget at aresponsible 4 percent, we have funded our priorities, we have paid down all theavailable debt, we have prepared for contingenciesand we still have money leftover.Yogi Berra once said: When you come to a fork in the road, take it. Now wecome to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even though we have already metour needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That is theroad our Nation has traveled in recent years. Last year, government spendingshot up 8 percent. That is far more than our economy grew, far more thanpersonal income grew and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue onthat road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security topay other bills.Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we musttake a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spendtheir own money to meet their own needs, to fund their own priorities and paydown their own debts. I hope you will join me and stand firmly on the side ofthe people.The growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is chargingmore than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged and on theirbehalf, I am here to ask for a refund.Some say my tax plan is too big, others say it is too small. I respectfullydisagree. This tax relief is just right. I did not throw darts at a board tocome up with a number for tax relief. I did not take a poll, or develop anarbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the tax codeand calculated the cost to fix them. A tax rate of 15 percent is too high forthose who earn low wages, so we lowered the rate to 10 percent. No one shouldpay more than a third of the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so welowered the top rate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief forAmericas small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate, and helpfor small business means jobs for Americans.We simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax rates from the currentfive rates to four lower ones: 10, 15, 25, and 33 percent. In my plan, no one istargeted in or targeted out . . . every one who pays income taxes will get taxrelief.Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reducedthe marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children,so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It is not fair to tax thesame earnings twiceonce when you earn them, and again when you die, so we mustrepeal the death tax. These changes add up to significant help. A typical familywith two children will save $1,600 a year on their Federal income taxes. Sixteenhundred dollars may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to manyfamilies. Sixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an entire year, itpays tuition for a year at a community college, it pays the average familygrocery bill for 3 months. That is real money.With us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and JosefinaRamos. Please help me welcome them. The Ramoses are from Pennsylvania, but theycould be from any one of your districts. Steven is a network administrator for aschool district, Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school, and theyhave a 2 yearold daughter, Lianna. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost$8,000 a year in Federal income taxes; my plan will same them more than $2,000.Let me tell you what Steven says:Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, itwould help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years.After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Liannas collegeeducation. Government should never stand in the way of families achieving theirdreams. The surplus is not the governments money, the surplus is the peoplesmoney.For lower income families, my tax relief plan restores basic fairness. Rightnow, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two childrenon $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns. Herovertime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends aterrible message: You will never get ahead. But Americas message must bedifferent: We must honor hard work, never punish it.With tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress.People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage reductions. Andmillions of additional American families will be removed from the income taxrolls entirely.Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion thatbegan almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventuallyhelp, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves. Forty yearsago and then twenty years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat and one Republican,John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts toin President Kennedyswordsget this country moving again.They knew then, what we must do now: To create economic growth and opportunity,we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and createjobs.We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified beforeCongress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So Iwant to work with you to give our economy an important jump start by making taxrelief retroactive. We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We mustalso act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage toconfront and resolve tough challenges: to restructure our Nations defenses, tomeet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security.America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace bypromoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our alliesand friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work forfree markets and free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progresstoward freedom will find America is their friend. We will promote our values,and we will promote peace. And we need a strong military to keep the peace. Butour military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I have askedthe Secretary of Defense to review Americas armed forces and prepare totransform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a downpayment on theresearch and development that will be required. Yet, in our broadertransformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our defensevision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. Our Nation alsoneeds a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century, threats thatare more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threatenwith bombs to tyrants and rogue nations intent on developing weapons of massdestruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must developand we must deploy effective missile defenses.And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce ourown nuclear forces to reflect todays needs.A strong America is the worlds best hope for peace and freedom. Yet the causeof freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies.Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve thelives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personalfreedom.Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiatefarreaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand ofpresidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs of energy.We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The Westis confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices anduncertainty. I have asked Federal agencies to work with California officials tohelp speed construction of new energy sources. And I have directed VicePresident CHENEY, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and othersenior members of my Administration to recommend a national energy policy.Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home whileprotecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meetdemand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation,and we must. America must become more energy independent.Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicareand Social Security. Medicares finances are strained and its coverage isoutdated. Ninety nine percent of employer provided health plans offer some formof prescription drug coverage . . . Medicare does not. The framework for reformhas been developed by Senators FRIST and BREAUX and Congressman THOMAS, and now,it is time to act. Medicare must be modernized. And we must make sure that everysenior on Medicare can choose a health plan that offers prescription drugs.Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim SocialSecurity benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows that Social Security is notprepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years toget prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a starkchoice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes, or a radical cut in retirementbenefits. There is a better way.This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. Thecommission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based onthese principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees andthose nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financialfooting. And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who wantthem. Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on themoney they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that byallowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments at a higher rate ofreturn.Ownership, access to wealth, and independence should not be the privilege of afew. They are the hope of every American . . . and we must make them thefoundation of Social Security. By confronting the tough challenge of reform, bybeing responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people.And, we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election andcampaign finance reforms.The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great country. Americais a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, andmuch is expected. Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree thatour good will must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more thanminding our manners, it is doing our duty. No one can speak in this Capitol andnot be awed by its history. At so many turning points, debates in these chambershave reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when wewalk through Statuary Hall, and see those men and women of marble, we arereminded of their courage and achievement.Yet Americas purpose is never found in statues or history. Americas purposealways stands before us. Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing,as our Nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage issue byissue, can gather to greatness, and serve our country. This is the privilege,and responsibility, we share. And if we work together, we can prove that publicservice is noble.We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish, andpromises to keep. Juntos podemos, together we can. We can make Americans proudof their government. Together we can share in the credit of making our countrymore prosperous and generous and justand earn from our conscience and from ourfellow citizens, the highest possible praise: well done, good and faithfulservants.Thank you. Good night. And God Bless America.
George W. Bush
To the Congress of the United States:Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tempore, Members of Congress, and fellowAmericans:In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on thestate of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already beendelivered by the American people.We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to saveothers on the groundpassengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer.Please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working pastexhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, thegiving of blood, the saying of prayersin English, Hebrew, and Arabic.We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people, who have made the griefof strangers their own.My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itselfthe state of our Unionand it is strong.Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Ourgrief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemiesto justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. I thank theCongress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America wastouched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats, joinedtogether on the steps of this Capitol, singing God Bless America. And youdid more than sing, you acted, by delivering forty billion dollars to rebuildour communities and meet the needs of our military.Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle, andSenator Lott, I thank you for your friendship and your leadership and yourservice to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the worldfor its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of ourNational Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, and on the streets of Paris, andat Berlins Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gatheringto pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at amosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning inAustralia and Africa and Latin America.Nor will we forget the citizens of eighty other nations who died with our own.Dozens of Pakistanis. More than 130 Israelis. More than 250 citizens of India.Men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and Japan. And hundreds of Britishcitizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we arejoined together in a great cause. The British Prime Minister has crossed anocean to show his unity of purpose with America, and tonight we welcome TonyBlair.On September the eleventh, enemies of freedom committed an act of war againstour country. Americans have known warsbut for the past 136 years, they havebeen wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have knownthe casualties of warbut not at the center of a great city on a peacefulmorning. Americans have known surprise attacksbut never before on thousands ofcivilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single dayand night fell on adifferent world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked ourcountry?The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliatedterrorist organizations known as al Qaida. They are the same murderers indictedfor bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for thebombing of the U.S.S. Cole.Al Qaida is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not makingmoney; its goal is remaking the worldand imposing its radical beliefs on peopleeverywhere.The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has beenrejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clericsa fringemovement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terroristsdirective commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, andmake no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children.This group and its leadersa person named Usama bin Ladinare linked to manyother organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihadand the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.There are thousands of these terrorists in more than sixty countries. They arerecruited from their own nations and neighborhoods, and brought to camps inplaces like Afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror. Theyare sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world toplot evil and destruction.The leadership of al Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan, and supports theTaliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we seeal Qaidas vision for the world. Afghanistans people have been brutalized manyare starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You canbe jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as theirleaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not longenough.The United States respects the people of Afghanistanafter all, we are currentlyits largest source of humanitarian aidbut we condemn the Taliban regime. It isnot only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere bysponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abettingmurder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. And tonight, the United Statesof America makes the following demands on the Taliban:Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaida who hide inyour land.Release all foreign nationalsincluding American citizensyou have unjustlyimprisoned, and protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in yourcountry.Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistanand hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, toappropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terroristtraining camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demandsare not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act and actimmediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in theirfate.I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world: Werespect your faith. It is practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and bymillions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings aregood and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme thename of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, ineffect, to hijack Islam itself.The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arabfriends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government thatsupports them.Our war on terror with al Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not enduntil every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, anddefeated. Americans are asking: Why do they hate us?They hate what we see right here in this chambera democratically electedgovernment. Their leaders are self appointed. They hate our freedomsour freedomof religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble anddisagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in manyMuslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to driveIsrael out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out ofvast regions of Asia and Africa.These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way oflife. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating fromthe world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand intheir way.We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before.They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century. Bysacrificing human life to serve their radical visionsby abandoning every valueexcept the will to powerthey follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, andtotalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends:in historys unmarked grave of discarded lies.Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war?We will direct every resource at our commandevery means of diplomacy, everytool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financialinfluence, and every necessary weapon of warto the disruption and defeat of theglobal terror network. This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decadeago, with its decisive liberation of territory and its swift conclusion. It willnot look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troopswere used and not a single American was lost in combat.Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any otherwe have seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on television, and covertoperations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turnthem one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is norefuge or rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven toterrorism.Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are withus, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation thatcontinues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United Statesas a hostile regime.Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will takedefensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens ofFederal departments and agencies, as well as State and local governments, haveresponsibilities affecting homeland security.These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight I announcethe creation of a Cabinet level position reporting directly to methe Office ofHomeland Security. And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to leadthis effort to strengthen Americas securitya military veteran, an effectiveGovernor, a true patriot, and my trusted friend, Pennsylvanias Governor TomRidge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategyto safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that maycome.These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threatto our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operativesto the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and allhave our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have amessage for our military: Be ready. I have called the armed forces to alert, andthere is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will makeus proud.This is not, however, just Americas fight. And what is at stake is not justAmericas freedom. This is the worlds fight. This is civilizations fight. Thisis the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance andfreedom.We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help ofpolice forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. TheUnited States is grateful that many nations and many international organizationshave already respondedwith sympathy and with support. Nations from LatinAmerica, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATOCharter reflects best the attitude of the world: an attack on one is an attackon all.The civilized world is rallying to Americas side. They understand that if thisterror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next.Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten thestability of legitimate governments. And we will not allow it.Americans are asking: What is expected of us?I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens havefears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of acontinuing threat.I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have comehere. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is tolive by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind wordsbecause of their ethnic background or religious faith.I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with yourcontributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information,libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in NewYork, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The thousands of FBI agents who are now atwork in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompanytighter securityand for your patience in what will be a long struggle.I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch itssource. America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, andenterprise of our people.These were the true strengths of our economy before September eleventh, and theyare our strengths today. Finally, please continue praying for the victims ofterror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journeyahead.Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for whatyou will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, theirrepresentatives, for what you have already done, and for what we will dotogether.Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together toimprove air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals ondomestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will cometogether to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with directassistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcementthe additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will cometogether to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans ofterrorists before they act, and find them before they strike. We will cometogether to take active steps that strengthen Americas economy, and put ourpeople back to work.Tonight we welcome here two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of allNew Yorkers: Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani. As a symbol ofAmericas resolve, my Administration will work with the Congress, and these twoleaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.After all that has just passedall the lives taken, and all the possibilitiesand hopes that died with themit is natural to wonder if Americas future is oneof fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, anddangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them.As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will notbe an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our griefand anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war.The advance of human freedomthe great achievement of our time, and the greathope of every timenow depends on us. Our Nation this generationwill lift adark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the worldto this cause, by our efforts and by our courage. We will not tire, we will notfalter, and we will not fail.It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost tonormal. Well go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even griefrecedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us willremember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We will remember themoment the news camewhere we were and what we were doing. Some will remember animage of fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and avoice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a mannamed George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. This ismy reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.I will not forget this wound to our country, or those who inflicted it. I willnot yieldI will not restI will not relent in waging this struggle for thefreedom and security of the American people.The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedomand fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God isnot neutral between them.Fellow citizens, we will meet violence with patient justiceassured of therightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that liesbefore us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States ofAmerica.Thank you.
George W. Bush
Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress,distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our Nation is atwar; our economy is in recession; and the civilized world faces unprecedenteddangers. Yet, the state of our Union has never been stronger.We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In 4 short months, our Nation hascomforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied agreat coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands ofterrorists, destroyed Afghanistan\'s terrorist training camps, saved a peoplefrom starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression.The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who onceoccupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And terrorist leaderswho urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own.America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We\'ll be partners inrebuilding that country. And this evening we welcomed the distinguished interimleader of a liberated Afghanistan, Chairman Hamid Karzai.The last time we met in this Chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistanwere captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan\'s new Government. And wewelcome the new Minister of Women\'s Affairs, Dr. Sima Samar.Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve ofour coalition, and to the might of the United States military. When I called ourtroops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage andskill. And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. The menand women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemyof the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, onmountaintops and in caves, you will not escape the justice of this Nation.For many Americans, these 4 months have brought sorrow and pain that will nevercompletely go away. Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero tofeel closer to his two sons who died there. At a memorial in New York, a littleboy left his football with a note for his lost father: "Dear Daddy, please takethis to heaven. I don\'t want to play football until I can play with you againsome day." Last month, at the grave of her husband, Micheal, a CIA officer andmarine who died in Mazar e Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell,"Semper Fi, my love." Shannon is with us tonight. Shannon, I assure you andall who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will neverforget the debt we owe Michael and all who gave their lives for freedom.Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmedour worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead. We have seen thedepth of our enemies\' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss ofinnocent life. And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of thedestruction they design. We have found diagrams of American nuclear powerplantsand public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons,surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks inAmerica and throughout the world.What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our waragainst terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes onSeptember the 11th were trained in Afghanistan\'s camps, and so were tens ofthousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods ofmurder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the worldlike ticking timebombs, set to go off without warning.Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners,hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of thousands of trainedterrorists are still at large. These enemies view the entire world as abattlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are. So long as trainingcamps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. AndAmerica and our allies must not and will not allow it.Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in thepursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist camps,disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And second, we mustprevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclearweapons from threatening the United States and the world.Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business,yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A terrorist underworld,including groups like Hamas, Hizballah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish e Mohammed,operates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities.While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is actingelsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train thatcountry\'s armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed anAmerican and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working with the BosnianGovernment, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our Embassy. Our Navy ispatrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and theestablishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terroristparasites who threaten their countries and our own. Many nations are actingforcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strongleadership of President Musharraf. But some governments will be timid in theface of terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threateningAmerica or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some ofthese regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know theirtrue nature.North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction,while starving its citizens.Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelectedfew repress the Iranian people\'s hope for freedom.Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. TheIraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weaponsfor over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murderthousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over theirdead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, thenkicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from thecivilized world.States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, armingto threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction,these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms toterrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack ourallies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, theprice of indifference would be catastrophic.We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their statesponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons ofmass destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses toprotect America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know:America will do what is necessary to ensure our Nation\'s security.We\'ll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on eventswhile dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer. TheUnited States of America will not permit the world\'s most dangerous regimes tothreaten us with the world\'s most destructive weapons.Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may not befinished on our watch; yet, it must be and it will be waged on our watch. Wecan\'t stop short. If we stop now, leaving terror camps intact and terroriststates unchecked, our sense of security would be false and temporary. Historyhas called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibilityand our privilege to fight freedom\'s fight.Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation, and that will bereflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports three great goalsfor America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we willrevive our economy.September the 11th brought out the best in America and the best in thisCongress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve.Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressingproblems here at home. I\'m a proud member of my party. Yet as we act to win thewar, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first andforemost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans.It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion dollars amonth, over $30 million a day, and we must be prepared for future operations.Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spareinnocent lives, and we need more of them. We need to replace aging aircraft andmake our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly andsafely. Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the bestequipment, the best training, and they also deserve another pay raise.My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades,because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high.Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect ourcitizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us saferunless we act on its lessons. America is no longer protected by vast oceans. Weare protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilanceat home.My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security,focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and bordersecurity, and improved intelligence. We will develop vaccines to fight anthraxand other deadly diseases. We\'ll increase funding to help States and communitiestrain and equip our heroic police and firefighters. We will improve intelligencecollection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the securityof air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures ofvisitors to the United States.Homeland security will make America not only stronger but, in many ways, better.Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health. Strongerpolice and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods. Stricter borderenforcement will help combat illegal drugs. And as government works to bettersecure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears ofalert citizens.A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passengerlighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had beentrained by Al Qaida and was armed with explosives. The people on that plane werealert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives. And tonight we welcomeand thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones.Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the finalgreat priority of my budget is economic security for the American people. Toachieve these great national objectives to win the war, protect the homeland,and revitalize our economy our budget will run a deficit that will be small andshort term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscallyresponsible manner. We have clear priorities, and we must act at home with thesame purpose and resolve we have shown overseas. We\'ll prevail in the war, andwe will defeat this recession.Americans who have lost their jobs need our help, and I support extendingunemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage. Yet,American workers want more than unemployment checks; they want a steadypaycheck. When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan canbe summed up in one word: jobs.Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we\'ve made a fine start. Republicansand Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that nochild is left behind. I was proud to work with members of both parties: ChairmanJohn Boehner and Congressman George Miller; Senator Judd Gregg. And I was soproud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy. I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn\'t believe I\'d saysuch a thing   but our work on this bill shows what is possible ifwe set aside posturing and focus on results.There is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and succeed inschool with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs. Wemust upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a majorrecruiting drive with a great goal for America, a quality teacher in everyclassroom.Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress must actto encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it mustact to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent onforeign oil.Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new jobs,so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives hasacted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this Hall thought mytax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big. But when the checksarrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right.Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doublingthe child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long term growth andto help Americans plan for the future, let\'s make these tax cuts permanent.The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy byencouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax reliefso people have more money to spend. For the sake of American workers, let\'s passa stimulus package.Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these importantreforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on governmentand offer every American the dignity of a job.Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without healthsecurity. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients\' bill ofrights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage, toapprove an historic increase in the spending for veterans\' health, and to giveseniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage forprescription drugs.A good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to enact newsafeguards for 401K and pension plans. Employees who have worked hard and savedall their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their companyfails. Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosurerequirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees andshareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct.Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of SocialSecurity, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable and allowpersonal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues:productive farm policy; a cleaner environment; broader homeownership, especiallyamong minorities; and ways to encourage the good work of charities andfaith based groups. I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues inthe same spirit of cooperation we\'ve applied to our war against terrorism.During these last few months, I\'ve been humbled and privileged to see the truecharacter of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies believed America wasweak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. Theywere as wrong as they are evil.The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion,strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and lookedinto the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people.And I hope you will join me I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to oneAmerican for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our Nation incrisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush.None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th. Yet,after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirrorand saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens withobligations to each other, to our country, and to history. We began to thinkless of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do.For too long our culture has said, "If it feels good, do it." Now America isembracing a new ethic and a new creed, "Let\'s roll." In the sacrifice ofsoldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosityof ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibilitycould look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.We\'ve been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hoursover the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and yourNation. Many are already serving, and I thank you. If you aren\'t sure how tohelp, I\'ve got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best that hasemerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The FreedomCorps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home;rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout theworld.One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America needsretired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies, volunteersto help police and fire departments, transportation and utility workerswell trained in spotting danger.Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We needmentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison. Andwe need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA Freedom Corps willexpand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruitmore than 200,000 new volunteers.And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every partof the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double itsvolunteers over the next 5 years, and ask it to join a new effort to encouragedevelopment and education and opportunity in the Islamic world.This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity, a moment we mustseize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of millions of actsof service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greatergood.And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world towardthe values that will bring lasting peace. All fathers and mothers, in allsocieties, want their children to be educated and live free from poverty andviolence. No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude oreagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police. If anyone doubts this,let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic "street" greeted the fall oftyranny with song and celebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam\'s own richhistory, with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress. America willlead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true andunchanging for all people everywhere.No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We have nointention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for thenonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power ofthe state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; andreligious tolerance.America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these valuesaround the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greaterobjective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. We seek a just andpeaceful world beyond the war on terror.In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries. Americais working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, toachieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free markets and free trade andfree societies are proving their power to lift lives. Together with friends andallies from Europe to Asia and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate thatthe forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return tonormal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those of us who havelived through these challenging times have been changed by them. We\'ve come toknow truths that we will never question: Evil is real, and it must be opposed.Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning togetherand facing danger together. Deep in the American character, there is honor, andit is stronger than cynicism. And many have discovered again that even intragedy especially in tragedy God is near.In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in thehistory of liberty, that we\'ve been called to a unique role in human events.Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.Our enemies send other people\'s children on missions of suicide and murder. Theyembrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand for a differentchoice, made long ago on the day of our founding. We affirm it again today. Wechoose freedom and the dignity of every life.Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom\'s price. Wehave shown freedom\'s power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, wewill see freedom\'s victory.Thank you all. May God bless.
George W. Bush
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizensand fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to considerthe state of the Union. This year, we gather in this Chamber deeply aware ofdecisive days that lie ahead.You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this sessionof Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country.We have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terribledisease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we willanswer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In awhirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure; our resolve is firm;and our Union is strong.This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we willnot pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, and othergenerations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we worktogether. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historiceducation reform, which must now be carried out in every school and in everyclassroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life.To protect our country, we reorganized our Government and created the Departmentof Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. Tobring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in ageneration. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed toughreforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask theHouse and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellowcitizens.Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough toemploy every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks,corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering. Yet,it\'s not growing fast enough or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, ourNation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand,more employers to put up the sign that says, "Help Wanted." Jobs are createdwhen the economy grows. The economy grows when Americans have more money tospend and invest, and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have thatmoney is not to tax it away in the first place.I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be madepermanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I\'ve signed thebill, this extra money will start showing up in workers\' paychecks. Instead ofgradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowlyraising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to Americanfamilies now.The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help oureconomy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this year, an average ofalmost $1,100 more of their own money; a family of 4 with an income of $40,000would see their Federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year; our planwill improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions and promised themfor future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans 3, or 5, or 7 yearsfrom now, it is even better for Americans today.We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our taxlaws. It\'s fair to tax a company\'s profits. It is not fair to again tax theshareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence and to help thenearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end theunfair double taxation of dividends.Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs meanmore taxpayers and higher revenues to our Government. The best way to addressthe deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growthand to show some spending discipline in Washington, DC.We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will sendyou a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, aboutas much as the average family\'s income is expected to grow. And that is a goodbenchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecksof American families.A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to thefuture of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep SocialSecurity sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest inretirement accounts that they will control and they will own.Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans. TheAmerican system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace ofdiscovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medicalcare costs too much, and many have no health coverage at all. These problemswill not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverageand rations care.Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a goodinsurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low  incomeAmericans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyersand HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of Americanmedicine.Health care reform must begin with Medicare. Medicare is the binding commitmentof a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access topreventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep theircoverage just the way it is. And just like you, the Members of Congress, andyour staffs and other Federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of ahealth care plan that provides prescription drugs.My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reformand strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for yearsabout strengthening Medicare. I urge the Members of this new Congress to actthis year.To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes ofhigher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairlysued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, andmany parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by afrivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, whiledramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energyplan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleanertechnology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skieslegislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from powerplantsover the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to helpprevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, andburn away millions of acres of treasured forests.I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and oureconomy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environmentin ways that generations before us could not have imagined.In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not throughendless lawsuits or command and control regulations but through technology andinnovation. Tonight I\'m proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so thatAmerica can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen powered automobiles.A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, whichcan be used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a newnational commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles totaking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by achild born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution free. Join me inthis important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our countrymuch less dependent on foreign sources of energy.Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems ofAmerica. For so many in our country, the homeless and the fatherless, theaddicted, the need is great. Yet there\'s power, wonder  working power, in thegoodness and idealism and faith of the American people.Americans are doing the work of compassion every day, visiting prisoners,providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors.These good works deserve our praise. They deserve our personal support, and whenappropriate, they deserve the assistance of the Federal Government.I urge you to pass both my Faith Based Initiative and the Citizen Service Act,to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and onesoul at a time.Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA FreedomCorps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America.Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of serviceand the resources of Government on the needs of some of our most vulnerablecitizens, boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention andchildren who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.I propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a milliondisadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government willsupport the training and recruiting of mentors. Yet it is the men and women ofAmerica who will fill the need. One mentor, one person can change a lifeforever, and I urge you to be that one person.Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds outfriendship, ambition, moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to asingle destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs bycutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs.Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their ownlives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight Ipropose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 Americansreceive treatment over the next 3 years.Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of themis found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in theprogram said, "God does miracles in people\'s lives, and you never think itcould be you." Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drugaddiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and itcould be you.By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who needtreatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values everylife. And in this work, we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you toprotect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice ofpartial birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended asthe object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity andpass a law against all human cloning.The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America alsodetermine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our powerand our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of humandignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. Thisconviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peaceand confound the designs of evil men.In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people. And we will continuehelping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all theirchildren, boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peacebetween a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America isfeeding the hungry. More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as agift from the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and buildsalliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as ablessed country is to make the world better.Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus,including 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries inAfrica where more than one third of the adult population carries the infection.More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent,only 50,000 AIDS victims  only 50,000 are receiving the medicine they need.Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seektreatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africadescribes his frustration. He says, "We have no medicines. Many hospitals tellpeople, \'You\'ve got AIDS. We can\'t help you. Go home and die.\' " In an age ofmiraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.AIDS can be prevented. Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. Andthe cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year,which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen,seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country.And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the EmergencyPlan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international effortsto help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million newAIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life extending drugs, andprovide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for childrenorphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDSin the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague ofnature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating themanmade evil of international terrorism.There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war onterror. There\'s never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receivereports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against ascattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.To date, we\'ve arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida.They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11thattacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned thebombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, an Al Qaidaoperations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida\'s trainingcamps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaidaleader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have beenarrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let\'s put itthis way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends andallies.We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. Americaand coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiraciestargeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudimilitary base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar.We\'ve broken Al Qaida cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well asBuffalo, New York.We have the terrorists on the run. We\'re keeping them on the run. One by one,the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: Here, in our own country.This Government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people anddefend our homeland. We\'ve intensified security at the borders and ports ofentry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained Federal screeners in airports,begun inoculating troops and first  responders against smallpox, and aredeploying the Nation\'s first early warning network of sensors to detectbiological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to fielda defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add toour future security with a major research and production effort to guard ourpeople against bioterrorism, called Project BioShield. The budget I send youwill propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines andtreatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. Wemust assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we mustact before the dangers are upon us.Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies haveworked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI isimproving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meetnew threats. Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, theHomeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist ThreatIntegration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a singlelocation. Our Government must have the very best information possible, and wewill use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect allour citizens.Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. Inthe ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field inPennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight:Whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties, we willnot permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men; free people will setthe course of history.Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facingAmerica and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear,chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons forblackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weaponsto terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.This threat is new. America\'s duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century,small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals,and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, theirambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions ofHitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples,by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States ofAmerica.Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared againand seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation andall our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaosand constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our peopleand the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. Wehave called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demandthat Iraq disarm. We\'re strongly supporting the International Atomic EnergyAgency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world.We\'re working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the formerSoviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production andshipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.In all these efforts, however, America\'s purpose is more than to follow aprocess; it is to achieve a result, the end of terrible threats to the civilizedworld. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophicattacks. And we\'re asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the courseof this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action isrequired, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and securityof the American people.Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see aGovernment that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, andsupports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death asthey speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like allpeople, have a right to choose their own Government and determine their owndestiny, and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear andstarvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiatedframework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know thatthat regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along. Andtoday the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear andseek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China,and Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Governmentthat nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, andcontinued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world andrevival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and notallow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with ahistory of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potentialwealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the UnitedStates.Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualtyin a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of allweapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violatedthat agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even whileinspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from hispursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from thecivilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein hisfinal chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the UnitedNations and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent toconduct were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across acountry the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify thatIraq\'s regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hidingits banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy themas directed. Nothing like this has happened.The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weaponssufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax, enough doses to killseveral million people. He hasn\'t accounted for that material. He\'s given noevidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that SaddamHussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinumtoxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. Hehasn\'t accounted for that material. He\'s given no evidence that he has destroyedit. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials toproduce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In suchquantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He\'s notaccounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyedthem. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up16 of them, despite Iraq\'s recent declaration denying their existence. SaddamHussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibitedmunitions. He\'s given no evidence that he has destroyed them.From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had severalmobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfareagents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. SaddamHussein has not disclosed these facilities. He\'s given no evidence that he hasdestroyed them.The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that SaddamHussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for anuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uraniumfor a bomb. The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recentlysought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sourcestell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitablefor nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained theseactivities. He clearly has much to hide.The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. Fromintelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi securitypersonnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors,sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqiofficials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.Iraq is blocking U 2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqiintelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed tointerview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientistswho cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along withtheir families.Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormoussums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why?The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for thoseweapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, SaddamHussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and createdeadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the American people mustrecognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secretcommunications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that SaddamHussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretlyand without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons toterrorists or help them develop their own.Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein couldbe contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses, and shadowy terroristnetworks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weaponsand other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, onecanister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like nonewe have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that thatday never comes.Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when haveterrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on noticebefore they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge,all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting inthe sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not anoption.The dictator who is assembling the world\'s most dangerous weapons has alreadyused them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind,or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained, bytorturing children while their parents are made to watch. International humanrights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq:electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilationwith electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, thenevil has no meaning.And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Yourenemy is not surrounding your country; your enemy is ruling your country. Andthe day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of yourliberation.The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept aserious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies. TheUnited States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5thto consider the facts of Iraq\'s ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary ofState Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi\'slegal Iraq\'s illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons frominspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein doesnot fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world,we will lead a coalition to disarm him.Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, membersof the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the MiddleEast, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of ourcause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guideyou. You believe in America, and America believes in you.Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President canmake. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war havenot. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow.This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the daysof mourning that always come.We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. Afuture lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war isforced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, inevery way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight withthe full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring tothe Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In 2years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness ofperil, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. Andwe go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to theright country.Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time.Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and toourselves. America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength.We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty ofstrangers.Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every personand the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America\'s gift tothe world, it is God\'s gift to humanity.We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do notknow we do not claim to know all the ways of providence, yet we can trust inthem, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all ofhistory.May He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
George W. Bush
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests,and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to greatresponsibilities, and we are rising to meet them.As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American service men and womenare deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to theoppressed and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America moresecure.Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are trackingterrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men andwomen of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts andborders. And their vigilance is protecting America.Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world.The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed is working.Tonight Members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion andreform that skeptics had thought impossible. You\'re raising the standards forour public schools, and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drugcoverage under Medicare.We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can goforward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerousillusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat tous. We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and Medicare,or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions.We\'ve not come all this way, through tragedy and trial and war, only to falterand leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the tasks of history, andthey expect the same from us. In their efforts, their enterprise, and theircharacter, the American people are showing that the state of our Union isconfident and strong.Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people.Twenty eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001  over 2 yearswithout an attack on American soil. And it is tempting to believe that thedanger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting and false. Thekilling has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem,Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and thecivilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give ourhomeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defendus. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federallaw enforcement to better share information to track terrorists, to disrupttheir cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similarprovisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are goodfor hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists.Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terroristthreat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vitallegislation to protect our citizens. You need to renew the PATRIOT Act.America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war. LastMarch, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to findhimself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last August the 11thbrought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attackin Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We\'re tracking Al Qaida around theworld, and nearly two thirds of their known leaders have now been captured orkilled. Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on themanhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and oneby one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimesthat harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear, chemical,or biological weapons. The United States and our allies are determined: Werefuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan theprimary training base of Al Qaida killers. As of this month, that country has anew constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women.Businesses are opening. Health care centers are being established, and the boysand girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With the help from the new Afghanarmy, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members ofthe Taliban and Al Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nationthat is free and proud and fighting terror, and America is honored to be theirfriend.Since we last met in this Chamber, combat forces of the United States, GreatBritain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the demands of theUnited Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein, and the people of Iraq arefree.Having broken the Ba\'athist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddamsupporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed andattack from the shadows. These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are aserious, continuing danger. Yet we\'re making progress against them. The onceall powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell. Ofthe top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Ourforces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting anaverage of 180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq just assurely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein\'s evil regime.The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has alwaysbeen willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq\'s onlylaw was the whim of one brutal man. Today, our coalition is working with theIraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights. We\'reworking with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to fullIraqi sovereignty by the end of June.As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in theirpower to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of ourcountry and our friends, but the United States of America will never beintimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi peoplewill live in freedom.Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own securityand their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq\'s mostrespected leaders, the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, AdnanPachachi.Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free andpeaceful nation.Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for thebetter. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose anddismantle all of his regime\'s weapons of mass destruction programs, including auranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi correctly judgedthat his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of massmurder.Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and GreatBritain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. Andone reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, andno one can now doubt the word of America.Different threats require different strategies. Along with nations in theregion, we\'re insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program. Americaand the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments andnot develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping the world\'s mostdangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes.When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the policeshield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended and a task that doesnot end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securingour country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, given by one, has beenkept by many.You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast thedifficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering.America\'s intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless.And the men and women of the American military  they have taken the hardestduty. We\'ve seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnightraids and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they returnand felt the sorrow when one is lost. I\'ve had the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a messhall in Baghdad.Many of our troops are listening tonight, and I want you and your families toknow: America is proud of you. And my administration and this Congress will giveyou the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror.I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all. They viewterrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcementand indictments. After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, someof the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison. But thematter was not settled. The terrorists were still training and plotting in othernations and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage ofSeptember the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers. Theterrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war iswhat they got.Some in this Chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of Iraq.Objections to war often come from principled motives, but let us be candid aboutthe consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We\'re seeking all thefacts. Already, the Kay Report identified dozens ofweapons of mass destruction related program activities and significant amountsof equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act,the dictator\'s weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day.Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have beenrevealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defianceby dictators around the world. Iraq\'s torture chambers would still be filledwith victims, terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq, where hundredsof thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands, would stillbe known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the worldwithout Saddam Hussein\'s regime is a better and safer place.Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. Thisparticular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia,Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark,Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, andthe 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home,we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners ordismiss their sacrifices.From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operationsin Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference,however, between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to theobjections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend thesecurity of our country.We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater MiddleEast, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume thatwhole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty andself government. I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desireto live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades,it will rise again.As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, itwill continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of Americaand our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in thegreater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront theallies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend. To cut throughthe barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcastservices are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian, and soon a newtelevision service will begin providing reliable news and information across theregion. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the NationalEndowment for Democracy and to focus its new work on the development of freeelections and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the MiddleEast. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy inAfghanistan and Iraq so those nations can light the way for others and helptransform a troubled part of the world.America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most basicbeliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is ademocratic peace, a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man andwoman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet weunderstand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause offreedom.In the last 3 years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths ofthe American economy. We have come through recession and terrorist attack andcorporate scandals and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted tostimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong and growingstronger.You have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to $1,000, reduced the marriagepenalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains andstock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes forevery American who pays income taxes.Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward.The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest innearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in almost 20 years;homeownership rates, the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing.Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity ishigh, and jobs are on the rise. These numbers confirm that the American peopleare using their money far better than Government would have, and you were rightto return it.America\'s growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology transformsthe way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive, and workersneed new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in high skilled fieldslike health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by helping more Americansgain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to belearned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too manychildren, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left BehindAct, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We\'reproviding more funding for our schools, a 36 percent increase since 2001. We\'rerequiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on thefundamentals. We are reporting results to parents and making sure they havebetter options when schools are not performing. We are making progress towardexcellence for every child in America.But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No ChildLeft Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the results werequire are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read anddo math at the third grade level, and that\'s not asking too much. Testing is theonly way to identify and help students who are falling behind. This Nation willnot go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to gradewithout them learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child, and the NoChild Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America\'schildren.At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain theskills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest growing occupationsrequire strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high schoollevel. So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21stCentury. This program will provide extra help to middle and high school studentswho fall behind in reading and math, expand advanced placement programs inlow income schools, invite math and science professionals from the privatesector to teach part time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell grants forstudents who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. Ipropose increasing our support for America\'s fine community colleges, so theycan I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are creating themost new jobs. By all these actions, we\'ll help more and more Americans to joinin the growing prosperity of our country. Job training is important, and so isjob creation. We must continue to pursue an aggressive, progrowth economicagenda.Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax reductionsyou passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will goback up. Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more inFederal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small businesses will pay highertaxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life. Unlessyou act, Americans face a tax increase. What Congress has given, the Congressshould not take away. For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed shouldbe permanent.Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employeeswith relief from needless Federal regulation and protect them from junk andfrivolous lawsuits.Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economyrun, so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system,promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources ofenergy.My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets forAmerica\'s entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers, to create jobs forAmerican workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nestegg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirementaccount. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for theAmerican people. And we should limit the burden of Government on this economy byacting as good stewards of taxpayers\' dollars.In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland,and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionaryspending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus onpriorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people\'s money. By doingso, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our valuesand benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary  worker program to matchwilling foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found tofill the job. This reform will be good for our economy because employers willfind needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary worker programwill help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement tofocus on true threats to our national security.I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration andunfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary  worker program willpreserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringingmillions of hard working men and women out from the shadows of American life.Our Nation\'s health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change.Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This dramaticprogress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care andhealth insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help controlthose costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country.Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and 2 months ago, you showed theway. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kepta basic commitment to our seniors. You are giving them the modern medicine theydeserve.Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive adrug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of mostprescription drugs, and millions of low income seniors can get an additional$600 to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage forpreventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors justentering Medicare can receive wellness exams.In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare.For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coveragetoday can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform,senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they canchoose a Medicare plan that fits them best, just as you, as Members of Congress,can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year,millions of Americans will be able to save money tax free for their medicalexpenses in a health savings account.I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of ourseniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare willmeet my veto.On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans canchoose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individualneeds. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidlyrising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to band together andnegotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with healthinsurance. I urge you to pass association health plans. I ask you to give lowerincome Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy theirown basic health insurance.By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reducecosts, and improve care. To protect the doctor patient relationship and keepgood doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medicallawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic healthcare coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.A Government run health care system is the wrong prescription. By keeping costsunder control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, wewill preserve the system of private medicine that makes America\'s health carethe best in the world.We are living in a time of great change in our world, in our economy, in scienceand medicine. Yet some things endure: courage and compassion, reverence andintegrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values we try to liveby never change, and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions suchas families and schools and religious congregations. These institutions, theseunseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we willdefend them. We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy,responsible children. When it comes to helping children make right choices,there is work for all of us to do.One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives andfutures on drugs. Our Government is helping parents confront this problem withaggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high schoolhas declined by 11 percent over the last 2 years. Four hundred thousand feweryoung people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, Ipropose new funding to continue our aggressive, community based strategy toreduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be aneffective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23 million forschools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children\'s lives. Theaim here is not to punish children but to send them this message: We love you,and we do not want to lose you.To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics playsuch an important role in our society, but unfortunately, some in professionalsports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance enhancingdrugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and itsends the wrong message, that there are shortcuts to accomplishment and thatperformance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners,union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the rightsignal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers youngpeople face, even when they\'re difficult to talk about. Each year, about 3million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them orkill them or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose agrassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We willdouble Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this factof life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexuallytransmitted diseases.Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the restof their lives. All of us, parents and schools and government, must worktogether to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the rightmessages to our children.A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe weshould respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the mostfundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has alreadytaken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under Federal law as aunion of a man and a woman and declares that one State may not redefine marriagefor other States.Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, withoutregard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issueof such great consequence, the people\'s voice must be heard. If judges insist onforcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to thepeople would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctityof marriage.The outcome of this debate is important, and so is the way we conduct it. Thesame moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual hasdignity and value in God\'s sight.It\'s also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassionof America\'s religious institutions. Religious charities of every creed aredoing some of the most vital work in our country: mentoring children, feedingthe hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet Government has often deniedsocial service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have across or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall.By Executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money tocompetition that includes faith based charities. Tonight I ask you to codifythis into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminateagainst them again.In the past, we\'ve worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners andprovide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask youto consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from longexperience that if they can\'t find work or a home or help, they are much morelikely to commit crime and return to prison. So tonight I propose a 4 year, $300million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placementservices, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisonersget mentoring, including from faith based groups. America is the land of secondchance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to abetter life.For all Americans, the last 3 years have brought tests we did not ask for andachievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation weare. In grief, we have found the grace to go on. In challenge, we rediscoveredthe courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown the nobleaims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense that we livein a time set apart.I\'ve been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown calmin times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul.All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of theyoungest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl inLincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It began, "Dear George W. Bush. Ifthere\'s anything you know I, Ashley Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone,please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country." Sheadded this P.S.: "If you can send a letter to the troops, please put, \'AshleyPearson believes in you.\' " Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops hasjust been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself: Study hard inschool; listen to your mom or dad; help someone in need; and when you and yourfriends see a man or woman in uniform, say, "Thank you." And Ashley, while youdo your part, all of us here in this great Chamber will do our best to keep youand the rest of America safe and free.My fellow citizens, we now move forward with confidence and faith. Our Nation isstrong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause ofall mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable, and it is notcarried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power whoguides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know thatHis purposes are just and true.May God continue to bless America.
George W. Bush
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of Government sharea great privilege: We\'ve been placed in office by the votes of the people weserve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders ofAfghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereignIraq.Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitmentof our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will setforth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back towork, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of ourUnion is confident and strong.Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances inmedicine, by the security purchased by our parents\' sacrifice. Now, as we see alittle gray in the mirror or a lot of gray  and we watch ourchildren moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state oftheir Union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer thatquestion. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do whatAmericans have always done and build a better world for our children and ourgrandchildren.First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutionson which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America\'s economy is the fastestgrowing of any major industrialized nation. In the past 4 years, we\'ve providedtax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, openedup new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership toits highest level in history. And in the last year alone, the United States hasadded 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, andthe Nation is grateful.Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, moreinnovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader ofthe world.America\'s prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the FederalGovernment. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I willsend you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending belowinflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit inhalf by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150Government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts ordo not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayerdollars must be spent wisely or not at all.To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a risinggeneration to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left BehindAct, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we\'re closing theachievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results fromour high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We willhelp an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career byreforming our job training system and strengthening America\'s communitycolleges. And we\'ll make it easier for Americans to afford a college educationby increasing the size of Pell grants.To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, notpunish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path ofadvancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free smallbusinesses from needless regulation and protect honest job creators from junklawsuits. Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsibleclass actions and frivolous asbestos claims, and I urge Congress to pass legalreforms this year.To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care moreaffordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more controlover their health decisions. I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensivehealth care agenda with tax credits to help low income workers buy insurance, acommunity health center in every poor county, improved information technology toprevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for smallbusinesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medicalliability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients havethe doctors and care they need.To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable,environmentally responsible energy. Nearly 4 years ago, I submitted acomprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources,a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home, including safe,clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut powerplant pollutionand improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong fundingfor leading edge technology, from hydrogen fueled cars to clean coal torenewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urgeCongress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependenton foreign energy.All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, butthey are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of futuregenerations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs ofan earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic,incoherent Federal Tax Code. I\'ve appointed a bipartisan panel to examine theTax Code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, youand I will work together to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easyto understand, and fair to all.America\'s immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of oureconomy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with lawsthat punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families anddeny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border. It is time foran immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobsAmericans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering andleaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.One of America\'s most important institutions, a symbol of the trust betweengenerations, is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was agreat moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes inthis new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed towardbankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, andmillions more are nearing retirement. And for them the system is sound andfiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do notlet anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change inany way.For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that willgrow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago for a verydifferent era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were muchlower than they are today. And a half century ago, about 16 workers paid intothe system for each person drawing benefits.Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not haveforeseen. In today\'s world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawingbenefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over thenext few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary,right now it\'s only about 3 workers. And over the next few decades, that numberwill fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewerworkers are paying ever  higher benefits to an ever larger number of retirees.So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will bepaying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a newshortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, theGovernment will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep thesystem afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. Ifsteps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would bedramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts inSocial Security benefits or other Government programs.I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates are notso distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5  year old, you\'realready concerned about how you\'ll pay for college tuition 13 years down theroad. If you\'ve got children in their twenties, as some of us do, the idea ofSocial Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter.And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and Ishare a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problemsof Social Security once and for all.Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of theoptions. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. FormerCongressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to pricesrather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke ofincreasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouragingearly collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel PatrickMoynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideasare on the table.I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead withcourage and honesty, because our children\'s retirement security is moreimportant than partisan politics. I will work with Members of Congress to findthe most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has agood idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. Wemust make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for anotherday. We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to havedignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must guarantee there is nochange for those now retired or nearing retirement. And we must take care thatany changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepareand plan for their future.As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system abetter deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is throughvoluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, aset portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for theSocial Security benefits of today\'s retirees. If you\'re a younger worker, Ibelieve you should be able to set aside part of that money in your ownretirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.Here\'s why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow overtime at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver, and youraccount will provide money for retirement over and above the check you willreceive from Social Security. In addition, you\'ll be able to pass along themoney that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your childrenand or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, andthe Government can never take it away.The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set carefulguidelines for personal accounts. We\'ll make sure the money can only go into aconservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We\'ll make sure that your earningsare not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We\'ll make sure there are goodoptions to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of yourretirement. We\'ll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at oncebut rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional Social Securitybenefits. And we\'ll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by startingpersonal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits oncontributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, becauseyou already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which letsworkers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadlybased investment funds. It\'s time to extend the same security and choice andownership to young Americans.Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honorand to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of mygeneration, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith and aredetermined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the sourceof these values, but Government should never undermine them.Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, itshould not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children,and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution ofmarriage.Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we muststrive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goalby developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcomedisabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the NationalInstitutes of Health.To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances alwaysserve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others.We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work withCongress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation orgrown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity.America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious,aggressive, and always ethical.Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty tofaithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I havea constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand therole of courts in our democracy and are well  qualified to serve on the bench,and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility:Every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote.Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must neverturn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America.Our Government will continue to support faith based and community groups thatbring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people,especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy or gangs or jail.Tonight I propose a 3 year initiative to help organizations keep young peopleout of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women andrejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach toat risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leadersin programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader ofthis nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you toreauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care andtreatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law,we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of newcases, African American men and women.Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equaljustice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds haveconfidence in the system that provides justice. In America, we must make doublysure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit, so weare dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongfulconviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training fordefense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives musthave competent lawyers by their side.Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America thatis safe from danger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our childrenall the freedoms we enjoy, and chief among them is freedom from fear.In the 3\\1/2\\ years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedentedactions to protect Americans. We\'ve created a new Department of Government todefend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reformour intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expandedresearch on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved bordersecurity, and trained more than a half million first responders. Police andfirefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working everyday to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemyabroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The AlQaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many ofits top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsorand harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimesseeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and withoutconsequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill manyand intimidate us all, and we will stay on the offensive against them until thefight is won.Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank theCongress for providing our service men and women with the resources they haveneeded. During this time of war, we must continue to support our military andgive them the tools for victory.Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, aninternational force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries havetroops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union providedtechnical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to helptrain Iraqi officers. We\'re cooperating with 60 governments in the ProliferationSecurity Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We\'reworking closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandonits nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries havecaptured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next 4 years, my administrationwill continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating theconditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions ofthe world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruitinggrounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nationsfor decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny andterror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom. Our enemiesknow this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on whathe called the "evil principle" of democracy. And we\'ve declared our ownintention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democraticmovements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of endingtyranny in our world.The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our formof government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences between us andour enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which atiny group of brutal, self appointed rulers control every aspect of every life.Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations,with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures.And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, theadvance of freedom will lead to peace.That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting inAfghanistan and Palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of Ukraineasserting their democratic rights and electing a President. We are witnessinglandmark events in the history of liberty, and in the coming years, we will addto that story.The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are nowshowing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure.Tomorrow morning Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her toIsrael and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and PresidentAbbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help thePalestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful,independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congressfor $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and securityreforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side byside in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal.To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United Stateswill work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror,while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is alreadytaking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The Government of SaudiArabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of itspeople in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt,which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the waytoward democracy in the Middle East.To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes thatcontinue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria stillallows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek todestroy every chance of peace in the region. You have passed and we are applyingthe Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian Government to end allsupport for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world\'sprimary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving itspeople of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European alliesto make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichmentprogram and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And tothe Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, Americastands with you.Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the MiddleEast, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front inthe war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a standthere. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we do nothave to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq willstrengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers fromDamascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, andthereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showedthe world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizenswent to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a newTransitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to thesound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerousto vote. She said, "Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me: The insurgentsare weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband andI got my parents, and we all came out and voted together." Americans recognizethat spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote isan act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act ofpersonal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.One of Iraq\'s leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Talebal Suhail. She says of her country, "We were occupied for 35 years by SaddamHussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paidthe cost but, most of all, to the soldiers." Eleven years ago, Safia\'s fatherwas assassinated by Saddam\'s intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad,Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country, and we arehonored that she is with us tonight.The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and willcontinue to attack it. Yet, the terrorists\' most powerful myth is beingdestroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are notonly fighting coalition forces; they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis,expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group ofextremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their ownfreedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in hisspeech to Congress last September, "Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder allthe security burdens of our country as quickly as possible." That is thenatural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission ofour coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase ofour work in that country.At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation withthe Iraqi Government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping preparemore capable Iraqi security forces, forces with skilled officers and aneffective command structure. As those forces become more self reliant and takeon greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners willincreasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defendtheir own country, and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty.Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, "Tell America not to abandonus." He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adaptingto circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standingfor the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make Americasafer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable forleaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believethey can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result, a country that isdemocratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, andable to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and womenserving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, oftentaking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment, andthey have given us an example of idealism and character that makes everyAmerican proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle,unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they\'remaking our Nation more secure. Some of our service men and women have survivedterrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to helpthem recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who diedfor our freedom and whose memory this Nation will honor forever.One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas,who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letterand told me how much Byron loved being a marine and how proud he was to be onthe frontline against terror. She wrote, "When Byron was home the last time, Isaid that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just huggedme and said, \'You\'ve done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.\' "Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts we honor freedom\'s defenders and ourmilitary families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood\'s mom anddad, Janet and Bill Norwood.[At this point, in the First Lady\'s box, guest Safia Taleb al Suhail embracedguest Janet Norwood.]In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We haveknown times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all thishistory, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that uniteus. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence infreedom\'s power to change the world. We are all part of a great venture: Toextend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustainour liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, "Each age is a dream that isdying, or one that is coming to birth." And we live in the country where thebiggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream until it wasfulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it wasachieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until, one day, it wasaccomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward withconfidence. The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we knowwhere it leads: It leads to freedom.Thank you, and may God bless America.
George W. Bush
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the SupremeCourt and Diplomatic Corps, distinguished guests and fellow citizens:Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called Americato its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted bythe hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago,and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King.Every time I am invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege, andmindful of the history we have seen together. We have gathered under thisCapitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We haveserved America through one of the most consequential periods of our history, andit has been my honor to serve with you.In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there willalways be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in acivil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. Toconfront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will andrespect for one another, and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Unionis strong, and together we will make it stronger.In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both thefuture and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently inpursuing the enemies of freedom, or retreat from our duties in the hope of aneasier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the worldeconomy, or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex andchallenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad andinviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people,the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by ourleadership, so the United States of America will continue to lead.Abroad, our Nation is committed to a historic, long term goal. We seek the endof tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. Inreality, the future security of America depends on it. On September 11, 2001, wefound that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 milesaway could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelterterrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of massdestruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights oftheir citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Everystep toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will actboldly in freedom\'s cause.Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story ofour time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world.Today, there are 122. And we are writing a new chapter in the story ofself government, with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions ofIraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon toEgypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At thestart of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democraticnations. And we do not forget the other half, in places like Syria, Burma,Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran, because the demands of justice, and the peaceof this world, require their freedom as well.No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it.And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam, theperversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all of us must taketheir declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system oftotalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm themselves with weaponsof mass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe havento launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strengthto challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. Whenthey murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, orbehead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will,allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: we loveour freedom, and we will fight to keep it.In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments andretreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackersalone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield toour own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat.By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving an assaulted world tofend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our ownideals, or even in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can becertain: the United States will not retreat from the world, and we will neversurrender to evil.America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the Nation that savedliberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies,and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history todeliver the oppressed, and move this world toward peace.We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or capturedmany of their leaders. And for the others, their day will come. We remain on theoffensive in Afghanistan, where a fine president and national assembly arefighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.And we are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, weare helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments willbe eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, we are continuingreconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption andbuild a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom.Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that areincreasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courageevery day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal. But that brutalityhas not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than 3 years,that nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to aconstitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has beenrelentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgentstrongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confidentin our plan for victory. I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people. I amconfident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are inthis fight to win, and we are winning.The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we makeprogress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we shouldbe able to further decrease our troop levels; but those decisions will be madeby our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C.Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted ourmilitary tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, wehave benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by Members ofCongress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out andseek your good advice.Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for successand defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight aloneis not wisdom. And second guessing is not a strategy.With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speakwith candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqiallies to death and prison, put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of astrategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little. Members ofCongress: however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, ourNation has only one option: we must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and standbehind the American military in its vital mission.Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of dutystronger than all fear. They know what it is like to fight house to house in amaze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killedby a roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also know the stakes. MarineStaff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah. He leftbehind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed toevery American. Here is what Dan wrote: "I know what honor is. It has been anhonor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledgethat you would not have to. Never falter. Don\'t hesitate to honor and supportthose of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."Staff Sergeant Dan Clay\'s wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, arewith us this evening. Welcome. Our Nation is grateful to the fallen, who live inthe memory of our country. We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear ourNation\'s uniform; and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget thesacrifices of America\'s military families.Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, theonly way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred andfear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peacefulchange. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across thebroader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning.Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, protection of minorities, andstrong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The greatpeople of Egypt have voted in a multiparty presidential election, and now theirgovernment should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appealof radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections, and now theleaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work forlasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform. Now it canoffer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts.Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they willreflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of everynation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of allhumanity.The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elitethat is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsorsterrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that must come toan end. The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions,and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclearweapons. America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. Andtonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you,and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future andwin your own freedom. And our Nation hopes one day to be the closest of friendswith a free and democratic Iran.To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouragingeconomic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands.Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies; it would keep usfrom helping our friends in desperate need. We show compassion abroad becauseAmericans believe in the God given dignity and worth of a villager withHIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a younggirl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regionsoverwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism,organized crime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS andmalaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that aremoving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, theUnited States is a partner for a better life. Shortchanging these efforts wouldincrease the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long term security,and dull the conscience of our country. I urge Members of Congress to serve theinterests of America by showing the compassion of America.Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home.The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, thisNation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military,and homeland security. These men and women are dedicating their lives toprotecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. They alsodeserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organizedcrime, so I ask you to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.It is said that prior to the attacks of September 11, our government failed toconnect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in theUnited States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas. But we didnot know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack,based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute, I haveauthorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue theinternational communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates toand from America. Previous Presidents have used the same constitutionalauthority I have, and Federal courts have approved the use of that authority.Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed. This terroristsurveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essentialto the security of America. If there are people inside our country who aretalking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit backand wait to be hit again.In all these areas, from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq,to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions, we need the support ofour friends and allies. To draw that support, we must always be clear in ourprinciples and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is adramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to leadbecause it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. Americanleaders, from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan, rejected isolation andretreat because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is onthe march. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a warthat will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steadybipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours. Together, letus protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead thisworld toward freedom.Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: we will build the prosperityof our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other majorindustrialized nations. In the last 2\\1/2\\ years, America has created 4.6million new jobs, more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even in theface of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people haveturned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In adynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. Thiscreates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people\'s fears. And so we areseeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition,pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off oureconomy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directingthe economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hearclaims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though this economycould not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, andthey lead in the same direction, toward a stagnant and second rate economy.Tonight I will set out a better path, an agenda for a Nation that competes withconfidence, an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs.Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing, and oureconomy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, andinvest. In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion inthe hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families; andthey have used it to help produce more than 4 years of uninterrupted economicgrowth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we donothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expectand will not welcome.Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more thantemporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make the taxcuts permanent.Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars.Every year of my Presidency, we have reduced the growth of nonsecuritydiscretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that cut this spending.This year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. Bypassing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billionnext year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleasedthat Members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the Federalbudget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problemtogether, if you pass the line item veto.We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, orentitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60,including two of my dad\'s favorite people, me and President Clinton. Thismilestone is more than a personal crisis; it is a national challenge. Theretirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on theFederal Government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare, andMedicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire Federal budget. And thatwill present future Congresses with impossible choices, staggering taxincreases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security; yet therising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. And with everyyear we fail to act, the situation gets worse. So tonight, I ask you to join mein creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements onSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This commission should include Membersof Congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to putaside partisan politics, work together, and get this problem solved.Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all thatAmericans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America isrelated to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. Withopen markets and a level playing field, no one can outproduce or outcompete theAmerican worker.Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds ourlaws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy. Our Nationneeds orderly and secure borders. To meet this goal, we must have strongerimmigration enforcement and border protection. And we must have a rational,humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs forpeople who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our government hasa responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, andwe are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans, we must confront therising cost of care, strengthen the doctor patient relationship, and help peopleafford the insurance coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronicrecords and other health information technology to help control costs and reducedangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts by makingsure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the sameadvantages that people working for big businesses now get. We will do more tomake this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worryabout losing their health insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many gooddoctors out of practice, leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties withouta single OB GYN, I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year.Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have a seriousproblem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable partsof the world.The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we havespent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliablealternative energy sources; and we are on the threshold of incredible advances.So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative, a 22 percent increase inclean energy research at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs intwo vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will investmore in zero  emission coal fired plants; revolutionary solar and windtechnologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our researchin better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution free cars thatrun on hydrogen. We will also fund additional research in cutting edge methodsof producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips, stalks, or switchgrass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitivewithin 6 years. Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help usreach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil importsfrom the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America,this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond apetroleum based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thingof the past.And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: we mustcontinue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatestadvantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitiouspeople; and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce the AmericanCompetitiveness Initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy andto give our Nation\'s children a firm grounding in math and science.First: I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most critical basicresearch programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This fundingwill support the work of America\'s most creative minds as they explore promisingareas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.Second: I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, toencourage bolder private sector investment in technology. With more research inboth the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life andensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation fordecades to come.Third: We need to encourage children to take more math and science and make surethose courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We have made agood start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which israising standards and lifting test scores across our country. Tonight, I proposeto train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses in mathand science; bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms;and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a betterchance at good high wage jobs. If we ensure that America\'s children succeed inlife, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world.Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share.I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and together wewill show the world what the American people can achieve.America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is notmeasured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another.So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.In recent years, America has become a more hopeful Nation. Violent crime rateshave fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have droppedby more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19 percentsince 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the lastthree decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has beenfalling for a dozen years in a row.These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience,in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibilityis a life of fulfillment. Government has played a role. Wise policies such aswelfare reform, drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption havemade a difference in the character of our country. And everyone here tonight,Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about thedirection of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions. They areconcerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged byactivist courts that try to redefine marriage. And they worry about children inour society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens stilldisplaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that Americais in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people knowbetter than that. We have proven the pessimists wrong before, and we will do itagain.A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law.The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench, Chief JusticeJohn Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both ofthem. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges mustbe servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench. Today marks theofficial retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful serviceto our Nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor.A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cutethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight, Iask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medicalresearch: human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos forexperiments, creating human animal hybrids, and buying, selling or patentinghuman embryos. Human life is a gift from our Creator, and that gift should neverbe discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen theethical standards of Washington, and I support your efforts. Each of us has madea pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is a pledge we mustnever forget, never dismiss, and never betray.As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character ofAmerica in our compassion and care for one another.A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction andlove. Through the Helping America\'s Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caringadults to get involved in the life of a child, and this good work is being ledby our First Lady, Laura Bush. This year we will add resources to encourageyoung people to stay in school, so more of America\'s youth can raise theirsights and achieve their dreams.A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering andemergency and stays at it until they are back on their feet. So far the FederalGovernment has committed $85 billion to the people of the gulf coast and NewOrleans. We are removing debris, repairing highways, and building strongerlevees. We are providing business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meetthese immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existedbefore the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellowcitizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is notonly temporary relief, but schools that teach every child and job skills thatbring upward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a business.As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americansare protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can beprevented and treated and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV,and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans. I ask Congress toreform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new funding to States sowe end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. We will also lead anationwide effort, working closely with African American churches andfaith based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma ofAIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America.Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence.We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We seegreat changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. Andsometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknownshore.Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every greatmovement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could have acceptedpeace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King couldhave stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory oversegregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division ofEurope and been complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far inour own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. LikeAmericans before us, we will show that courage, and we will finish well. We willlead freedom\'s advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We willrenew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward,optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of thevictories to come.May God bless America.
George W. Bush
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:Thank you very much. Tonight, I have a high privilege anddistinct honor of my own   as the first President to begin the State of the Unionmessage with these words: Madam Speaker.In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D\'Alesandro, Jr., from Baltimore,Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing couldcompare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speakerof the House of Representatives. Congratulations, Madam Speaker.Two Members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for therecovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman CharlieNorwood.Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests,and fellow citizens:This rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour, when decisions arehard and courage is tested. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. Wemust have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies, and thewisdom to face them together.Some in this Chamber are new to the House and Senate, and I congratulate theDemocratic majority. Congress has changed, but our responsibilities have not.Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful.Yet we are all held to the same standards and called to serve the same goodpurposes: to extend the Nation\'s prosperity, to spend the people\'s money wisely,to solve problems, not leave them to future generations, to guard Americaagainst all evil, and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us.We are not the first to come here with government divided and uncertainty in theair. Like many before us, we can work through our differences and achieve bigthings for the American people. Our citizens don\'t much care which side of theaisle we sit on, as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there iswork to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans andhelp them to build a future of hope and opportunity, and this is the businessbefore us tonight.A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, and that is whatwe have. We are now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recoverythat has created 7.2 million new jobs, so far. Unemployment is low, inflation islow, and wages are rising. The economy is on the move, and our job is to keep itthat way, not with more government but with more enterprise.Next week, I will deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, Iwant to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for thisCongress.First, we must balance the Federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes.What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set agoal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal 3 years ahead ofschedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit abudget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you tomake the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of theFederal Government and balance the Federal budget.Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are oftenslipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C SPAN is watching. In 2005alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor ofthe House and Senate. They are dropped into committee reports that are not evenpart of the bill that arrives on my desk. You did not vote them into law. I didnot sign them into law. Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law.The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform thebudget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote inCongress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end ofthis session.Finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge ofentitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments ofconscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet we arefailing in that duty, and this failure will one day leave our children withthree bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cutsin benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we havenot found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. Withenough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid, andsave Social Security.Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that givechildren the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we roseabove partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preservinglocal control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable forresults. And because we acted, students are performing better in reading andmath, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.Now the task is to build on this success, without watering down standards,without taking control from local communities, and without back sliding andcalling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving localleaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families withchildren stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We mustincrease funds for students who struggle, and make sure these children get thespecial help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for thejobs of the future, and our country is more competitive, by strengthening mathand science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America\'schildren, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordableand available health care. When it comes to health care, government has anobligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we willmeet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health careinsurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afforda health insurance policy.So tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford theirown insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurancethat will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families withhealth insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income.Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on$7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, andchildren who are now covered by employer provided insurance will benefit fromlower tax bills.At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do notget health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase healthinsurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings,$4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of otherAmericans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put abasic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the Tax Code isa vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative waysto cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insuranceavailable to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help themprovide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal fundsand use them to create "Affordable Choices" grants. These grants would give ourNation\'s Governors more money and more flexibility to get private healthinsurance to those most in need.There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand healthsavings accounts. We need to help small businesses through association healthplans, we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better informationtechnology. We will encourage price transparency, and to protect good doctorsfrom junk lawsuits we need to pass medical liability reform. And in all we do,we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by governmentand insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration systemworthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. Whenlaws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of ourcountry. To secure our border, we are doubling the size of the Border Patrol,and funding new infrastructure and technology.Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we takepressure off the border, and that requires a temporary worker program. We shouldestablish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country towork on a temporary basis. As a result, they won\'t have to try to sneak in, andthat will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminalsand terrorists. We will enforce our immigration laws at the work site, and giveemployers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there is noexcuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the great tradition of themelting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve thestatus of illegal immigrants who are already in our country, without animosityand without amnesty.Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have aserious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign,comprehensive immigration reform into law.Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keepsAmerica\'s economy running and America\'s environment clean. For too long ourNation has been dependent on foreign oil, and this dependence leaves us morevulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists, who could cause hugedisruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm toour economy.It is in our vital interest to diversify America\'s energy supply, and the wayforward is through technology. We must continue changing the way Americagenerates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solarand wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with batteryresearch for plug in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean dieselvehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods ofproducing ethanol, using everything from wood chips, to grasses, to agriculturalwastes.We have made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington andthe strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances arewithin reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Letus build on the work we have done and reduce gasoline usage in the United Statesby 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that, we will be cutting ourtotal imports by the equivalent of three quarters of all the oil we now importfrom the Middle East.To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by settinga mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable andalternative fuels in 2017. And that is nearly five times the current target. Atthe same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for carsthe way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 8\\1/2\\ billion more gallonsof gasoline by 2017.Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence onforeign oil, but it is not going to eliminate it. So as we continue to diversifyour fuel supply, we must also step up domestic oil production in environmentallysensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to ouroil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the StrategicPetroleum Reserve.America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us tolive our lives less dependent on oil. These technologies will help us becomebetter stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront theserious challenge of global climate change.A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice.The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of casespending in our Federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that theFederal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timelyrulings. As president, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women tovacancies on the Federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty as well,to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up or down vote on the Senatefloor.For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protectthe people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since wesaw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We have hadtime to take stock of our situation. We have added many critical protections toguard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that Septembermorning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stopthem.With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict andthe course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracyfaces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled, that to win thewar on terror we must take the fight to the enemy.From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying onthe offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easymovement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. Forthe terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. Wecannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevents,but here is some of what we do know: we stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly ahijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast. We broke up aSoutheast Asian terrorist cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the UnitedStates. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacksagainst America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot toblow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For eachlife saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devotetheir lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions ofthis enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in theworld. And so long as that is the case, America is still a Nation at war.In the minds of the terrorists, this war began well before September 11 and willnot end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past 5 years havegiven us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and itsfollowers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh andnarrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal isthe opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, andpromise paradise for the murder of the innocent.Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrowmoderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry outnew attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want toforce our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty.They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarianideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: "We willsacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is comingis even worse." And Osama bin Laden declared: "Death is better than living onthis Earth with the unbelievers among us."These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in theIslamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that weface an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile toAmerica and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known totake direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terroristslike Hezbollah, a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it hastaken.The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarianthreat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent, they havethe same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in theMiddle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to youthat the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of thisgovernment to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, lawenforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and toprotect the American people.This war is more than a clash of arms. It is a decisive ideological struggle,and the security of our Nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove theconditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes andto come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom, societieswhere men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, andlive by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn toviolent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when theyare given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helpingmoderates, reformers, and brave voices for democracy. The great question of ourday is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build freesocieties and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake ofour own security, we must.In the last 2 years, we have seen the desire for liberty in the broader MiddleEast, and we have been sobered by the enemy\'s fierce reaction. In 2005, theworld watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the CedarRevolution. They drove out the Syrian occupiers, and chose new leaders in freeelections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and electeda democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three nationalelections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive,democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government underthat constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst,nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope andsolidarity we should never forget.A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, aprominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, withsupport from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking toundermine Lebanon\'s legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban andal Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan andNATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of themost sacred places in Shia Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity,directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation fromIraqi Shia, and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receivesupport from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation ofsectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in. Everyone of us wishes that this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us toleave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk.Ladies and gentlemen, on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power toshape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve and turn events towardvictory.We are carrying out a new strategy in Iraq, a plan that demands more from Iraq\'selected government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need tocomplete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule oflaw, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an allyin the war on terror.In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi Government must stop thesectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do thison their own. So we are deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additionalsoldiers and marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where theywill help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisersembedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will helpsecure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roamingdeath squads. And in Anbar province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered andlocal forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we are sending anadditional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists andclear them out. We did not drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistanonly to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now is the time for theirgovernment to act. Iraq\'s leaders know that our commitment is not open ended.They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, andthey must do so. They have pledged that they will confront violent radicals ofany faction or political party. And they need to follow through and liftneedless restrictions on Iraqi and Coalition forces so these troops can achievetheir mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq\'sleaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achievereconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq\'s citizens, to put thewealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to reentertheir nation\'s civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibilityfor security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdadmust be secured. And our plan will help the Iraqi Government take back itscapital and make good on its commitments.My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed theoptions. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this courseof action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this Chamberunderstand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that theconsequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching.If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi Governmentwould be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battlebetween Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaedaand supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out acrossthe country, and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective.Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq wouldemerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources,and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen wouldbe to ignore the lessons of September 11 and invite tragedy. And ladies andgentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than forAmerica to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq, and to spare theAmerican people from this danger.This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken withmany of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you have made. We wentinto this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. Andwhatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing anew strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask youto support our troops in the field, and those on their way.The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continuelong after you and I have turned our duties over to others. That is why it isimportant to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through. Bothparties and both branches should work in close consultation. And this is why Ipropose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up ofleaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how toposition America to meet every challenge that confronts us. And we will show ourenemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.One of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of ourmilitary, so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challengesahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of ouractive Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 years. A second task we cantake on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps.Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease theburden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skillsto serve on missions abroad when America needs them. And it would give peopleacross America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the definingstruggle of our time.Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle, because we arenot in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying theworld to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces areoperating under a mandate from the United Nations, and we are working withJordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the gulf states to increase support for Iraq\'sgovernment. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clearthat the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons.With the other members of the Quartet, the U.N., the European Union and Russia,we are pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing theestablishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israelin peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning backthe Taliban and al Qaeda offensive, the first time the alliance has deployedforces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China,Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we are pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve aKorean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. And we will continue to speak out forthe cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma, and continue toawaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work inthe world is also based on a timeless truth: to whom much is given, much isrequired. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty anddisease, and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fightHIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded ourEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life saving drugshas grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 3 short years. I ask you tocontinue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, and I ask you to provide $1.2billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I askthat you fund the Millennium Challenge Account so that American aid reaches thepeople who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption isin retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt reliefthat are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity ofour country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greateststrength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self sacrifice of theAmerican people. You see this spirit often if you know where to look, andtonight we need only look above to the gallery.Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa amid great poverty and disease. He came toGeorgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine, but Coach JohnThompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a starin the NBA and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land ofhis birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand newhospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good hearted man:"Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things."And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States ofAmerica.After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner Clark searched for ways to share herlove of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment and beganfilming children\'s videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born,and in just 5 years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. InNovember 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to Walt Disney Company; and with herhelp, Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents thegreat enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to helpothers, producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center forMissing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: "I believe it isthe most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have theright to live in a world that is safe." And so tonight we are pleased to welcomethis talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur, JulieAigner Clark.Three weeks ago, Wesley Autry was waiting at a Harlem subway station with histwo little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With secondsto act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between therails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists heis not a hero. He says: "We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have ourfreedoms. We have got to show each other some love." There is somethingwonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like WesleyAutry.Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when heenlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissancemission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee,Sergeant Rieman returned fire. He used his body as a shield to protect hisgunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to hislegs, yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight. He helped torepel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy\'s position. For hisexceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like somany other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned therespect and the gratitude of our whole country.In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit andcharacter of America, and these qualities are not in short supply. This is adecent and honorable country, and resilient, too. We have been through a lottogether. We have met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lieahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence, because the state of our Union isstrong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. Godbless. Thank you for your prayers. Thank you.
George W. Bush
Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguishedguests, and fellow citizens:Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. Inthat time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined.We have faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in theworld economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues callfor vigorous debate, and I think its fair to say weve answered that call. Yethistory will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. Andtogether, we showed the world the power and resilience of Americanself government.All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the peoples business. That isthe purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. And it remains ourcharge to keep.The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity ofour nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let usshow our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and aredetermined to meet them. And let us show them that Republicans and Democratscan compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we have made goodprogress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American peopleexpect us to get it done.In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nationgreat. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine theirdestiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliableguide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. So in allwe do, we must trust in the ability of free people to make wise decisions, andempower them to improve their lives and their futures.To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money andempower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy isundergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, butso are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market hasdeclined. And at kitchen tables across our country, there is concern about oureconomic future.In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But inthe short run, we can all see that growth is slowing. So last week, myadministration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican LeaderBoehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individualsand families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be toload up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option isacceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing andour people working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.We have other work to do on taxes. Unless the Congress acts, most of the taxrelief we have delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. Some inWashington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Tryexplaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxesrise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happyto pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm, and I am pleased to reportthat the I.R.S. accepts both checks and money orders.Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressureson their finances, American families should not have to worry about thefederal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There is onlyone way to eliminate this uncertainty: make the tax relief permanent. Andmembers of Congress should know: If any bill raising taxes reaches my desk, Iwill veto it.Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trustby spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I will send you a budget thatterminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totalingmore than $18 billion. And this budget will keep America on track for asurplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets, and soshould their government.The peoples trust in their government is undermined by Congressional earmarks special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, withoutdiscussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number andcost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks intocommittee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goalwas met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cutthe number and cost of earmarks in half, I will send it back to you with myveto. And tomorrow, I will issue an Executive Order that directs federalagencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress. Ifthese items are truly worth funding, the Congress should debate them in theopen and hold a public vote.Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending.On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownershipand empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. Myadministration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance, which is helping manystruggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. The Congress can help even more.Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow state housing agenciesto issue tax free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. Theseare difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, wecan help more of them keep their homes.To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctorsto make medical decisions and empower them with better information and betteroptions. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable andaccessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is byexpanding consumer choice, not government control. So I have proposed endingthe bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurancethrough their employer. This one reform would put private coverage withinreach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. TheCongress must also expand health savings accounts, create Association HealthPlans for small businesses, promote health information technology, andconfront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we willhelp ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy ofyour doctors office  not in the halls of Congress.On education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empowerparents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across ourcountry, there are boys and girls with dreams  and a decent education is theironly hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came together to pass the NoChild Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results. Last year,fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Readingscores are on the rise. And African American and Hispanic students postedall time highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, addflexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high schooldropouts, and provide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress:The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding.And we owe it to Americas children, their parents, and their teachers tostrengthen this good law.We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up.Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 ofthe poorest children in our nations capital have found new hope at afaith based or other non public school. Sadly, these schools are disappearingat an alarming rate in many of Americas inner cities. So I will convene aWhite House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And toopen the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new$300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grantshelp low income college students realize their full potential. Together, wehave expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now lets apply that samespirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the worldand empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economicgrowth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods, crops, andservices all over the world. So we are working to break down barriers to tradeand investment wherever we can. We are working for a successful Doha round oftrade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the sametime, we are pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing freetrade agreements.I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. Now I ask youto approve agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Many productsfrom these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products facesteep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field.They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. And they willsupport good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose productssay "Made in the USA."These agreements also promote Americas strategic interests. The firstagreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America thatis confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we failto pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism inour hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show ourneighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.Trade brings better jobs, better choices, and better prices. Yet for someAmericans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has aresponsibility to help. I ask the Congress to reauthorize and reform tradeadjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skillsand find new jobs.To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius ofAmerican researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a newgeneration of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and ourenvironment all require reducing our dependence on oil. Last year, I asked youto pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and youresponded. Together we should take the next steps: Let us fund newtechnologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions.Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions free nuclear power.Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuelsto power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new internationalclean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and Chinamake greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an internationalagreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse thegrowth of greenhouse gases. This agreement will be effective only if itincludes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. TheUnited States is committed to strengthening our energy security andconfronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is forAmerica to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and moreefficient technology.To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of ourscientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs oftomorrow. Last year, the Congress passed legislation supporting the AmericanCompetitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. Thisfunding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask the Congress todouble federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciencesand ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on earth.On matters of science and life, we must trust in the innovative spirit ofmedical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments whilerespecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievementwhen scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act likeembryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyondthe divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicinewithout the destruction of human life. So we are expanding funding for thistype of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues ofresearch, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity itdeserves. So I call on the Congress to pass legislation that bans unethicalpractices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empowerjudges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I havesubmitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not thewhim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They areworthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a promptup or down vote.In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of theAmerican people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over thepast seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuitof happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered inrecord numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith based groupsare bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from thefederal government. And to help guarantee equal treatment for faith basedorganizations when they compete for federal funds, I ask you to permanentlyextend Charitable Choice.Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the GulfCoast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of thisregion. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better thanbefore. And tonight I am pleased to announce that in April we will host thisyears North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in thegreat city of New Orleans.There are two other pressing challenges that I have raised repeatedly beforethis body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending andimmigration.Every Member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs likeSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford.And we all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path:massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or cripplingdeficits. I have laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I askmembers of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisansolution to save these vital programs for our children and grandchildren.The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure ourborders  and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. Weare increasing work site enforcement, we are deploying fences and advancedtechnologies to stop illegal crossings, we have effectively ended the policyof "catch and release" at the border, and by the end of this year, we willhave doubled the number of border patrol agents. Yet we also need toacknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create alawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This willtake pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on thosewho mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal withpeople here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can beresolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and ourhighest ideals.This is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a prosperousfuture for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad andadvancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, whengiven the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last sevenyears, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We haveseen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fairelections. We have seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand theirindependence. We have seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban tochoose a new president and a new parliament. We have seen jubilant Iraqisholding up ink stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. And these imagesof liberty have inspired us.In the past seven years, we have also seen images that have sobered us. Wehave watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the casketsof beloved leaders taken by the assassins hand. We have seen wedding guests inblood soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqisblown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apartby bombs. And on a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellowcitizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grimreminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists  evilmen who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to theirviolent rule.Since September 11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists andextremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and wewill deliver justice to the enemies of America.We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. Theterrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear.Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: Inthe long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies willreject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. That is why the terrorists arefighting to deny this choice to people in Lebanon,Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why,for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading thehope of freedom.In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations arehelping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country.Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation thatwas once a safe haven for Al Qaeda is now a young democracy where boys andgirls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and peopleare looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so weare adding 3,200 Marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fightthe terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban andAl Qaeda is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supportingAmericas vital mission in Afghanistan.In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud peopletheir liberty and to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. Oneyear ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq intochaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge ofAmerican forces into Iraq. And we gave our troops a new mission: Work withIraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds,and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Thosewho had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens ofthousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forcesmoving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind toensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along withprovincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers andother skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security wasfollowed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq areperforming with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of ourwhole nation.The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni triballeaders grew tired of Al Qaedas brutality and started a popular uprisingcalled "the Anbar Awakening." Over the past year, similar movements havespread across the country. And today, this grass roots surge includes morethan 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The government inBaghdad has stepped forward as well  adding more than 100,000 new Iraqisoldiers and police during the past year.While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American andIraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one yearago:When we met last year, many said containing the violence was impossible. Ayear later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down,and sectarian killings are down.When we met last year, militia extremists  some armed and trained by Iran were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqiforces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of allbackgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters iscritical to the future of their country.When we met last year, Al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, andtheir leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of thecountry. Today, it is Al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage. They havebeen driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and over the pastyear, we have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, includinghundreds of key Al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Ladenreleased a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who haveturned on Al Qaeda and admitted that Coalition forces are growing stronger inIraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among theterrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemywill be defeated.When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today,because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of"return on success," and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning tocome home.This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance oftheir commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly to our men and womenon the front lines. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen:In the past year, you have done everything we have asked of you, and more. Ournation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. Andtonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, wemake you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need toprotect our nation. And I ask the Congress to meet its responsibilities tothese brave men and women by fully funding our troops.Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we canstill expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is tosustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to thenext phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leadingoperations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protectiveoverwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat teamand one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not bereplaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marinebattalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 ofour troops are coming home.Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq andthe recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that toofast a drawdown could result in the "disintegration of the Iraqi SecurityForces, Al Qaeda Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase inviolence." Members of Congress: Having come so far and achieved so much, wemust not allow this to happen.In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on theprogress they are making toward political reconciliation. At the local level,Sunnis, Shia and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim theircommunities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the provinces must be matchedby progress in Baghdad. And we are seeing some encouraging signs. The nationalgovernment is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The parliament recentlypassed both a pension law and de Baathification reform. Now they are debatinga provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But afterdecades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation istaking place  and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But it is inthe vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will denyAl Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle Eastthat a future of liberty is possible. And a free Iraq will be a friend ofAmerica, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in adangerous part of the world.By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden extremists, strengthen Iran, andgive terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, ourallies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a timewhen the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaedas top commander in Iraqdeclared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here inWashington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest either. We will not restuntil this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today, sothat years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose tothe moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful regionand a safer America.We are also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, wherewe have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a president whorecognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where hispeople can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders whorecognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source oflasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders fromboth sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help themachieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of thisyear. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and ademocratic Palestine live side by side in peace.We are also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime inTehran. Irans rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedomadvances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to opposeit. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollahterrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in theHoly Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing rangeand continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be usedto create a nuclear weapon. Our message to the people of Iran is clear: Wehave no quarrel with you, we respect your traditions and your history, and welook forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leadersof Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, sonegotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come cleanabout your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home,and cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: Americawill confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, andwe will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.On the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measureto protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful thatthere has not been another attack on our soil since September 11. This is notfor a lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past sixyears, we have stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane intothe tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jetsbound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our governmenttoil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. Thesegood citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owesthem our thanks. And we owe them something more: We owe them the tools theyneed to keep our people safe.One of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitorterrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who theterrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they are planning.Last year, the Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately,the Congress set the legislation to expire on February 1. This means that ifyou do not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would beweakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. The Congress must ensurethe flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. The Congress must passliability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts todefend America. We have had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.Protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more thangood intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing theconditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. SoAmerica is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and morecompassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interest and thecalling of our conscience.America is opposing genocide in Sudan and supporting freedom in countries fromCuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.America is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong educationinitiatives and humanitarian assistance. We have also changed the way wedeliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This programstrengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developingnations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half theworlds food aid comes from the United States. And tonight, I ask the Congressto support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasingcrops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up localagriculture and help break the cycle of famine.America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we are workingto cut by half the number of malaria related deaths in 15 African nations. Andour Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We canbring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principlesthat have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on youto double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving anadditional $30 billion over the next 5 years.America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionatepeople, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who havestepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have riskedlife and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past sevenyears, we have increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. As weincrease funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs ofa new war and a new generation. I call on the Congress to enact the reformsrecommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improvethe system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope,promise, and dignity.Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nightsand the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is servingfar from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you tojoin me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiringpreferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowingour troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses orchildren. Our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, andtonight our nation honors them.The secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness liesnot in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. Whenthe Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound bythe Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, "We the undersigneddelegates." When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our newConstitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words thatchanged the course of our nation and the history of the world: "We thepeople."By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nationcould be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women.By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile youngdemocracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope formillions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation willprosper, our liberty will be secure, and the State of our Union will remainstrong. So tonight, with confidence in freedoms power, and trust in thepeople, let us set forth to do their business.
Donald Trump
Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\'s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\'s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in an unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands, and we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world friend or foe will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we\'ve watched our middle class shrink as we\'ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\'ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.We\'ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we\'ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again.Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.  Thank you.It\'s been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\'ve made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8 a record. We\'ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic and it is a fantastic new F 35 jet fighter, and we\'ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential Federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban  thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government agency. And we\'re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We\'re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. And I\'ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.We have withdrawn the United States from the job killing Trans Pacific Partnership. And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed, but that can\'t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I\'ve promised throughout the campaign.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from radical Islamic terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and to keep those out who will do us harm.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\'s ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.We\'ve lost more than one fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\'ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers have to do it. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House. And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, "No, thank you." At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\'s good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales? They told me without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they\'ve become used to it that it\'s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren\'t even asking for a change. But I am.I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It\'s been a long time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government will produce want and ruin among our people." Lincoln was right, and it\'s time we heeded his advice and his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer.I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many others, have a merit based immigration system. It\'s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers\' wages, and help struggling families including immigrant families enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our Nation\'s security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program the building of the Interstate Highway System. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East; all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy American and hire American.Tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.Mandating every American to buy Government approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State the State of Kentucky and it\'s unsustainable and collapsing.One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all. There\'s no choice left. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans:First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.Thirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave; to invest in women\'s health; and to promote clean air and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan\'s dad John fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\'s life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.Megan\'s story is about the unbounded power of a father\'s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\'s life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning great learning center with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her master\'s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high paying job. But to create this future, we must work with, not against not against the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it\'s what it is division. It\'s pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They\'re friends and neighbors, they\'re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they\'ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel\'s 17 year old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war. If they must, they have to fight and they only have to win.I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for America in uniform.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that and I quote "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy." Ryan\'s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. And Ryan is looking down, right now you know that and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\'s life for one\'s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated communism.But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our partners whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world all across the world. The only long term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\'s centennial. At that celebration, the country\'s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\'s 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are made by the same God.When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.
Donald Trump
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission: to make America great again for all Americans.Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\'s soul and the steel in America\'s spine.Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He\'s here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands everywhere we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.Some trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3.5 months later: the legend from Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise.   I think they like you, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath yes. Yes.In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. Thank you. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there\'s a challenge, we tame it. If there\'s an opportunity, we seize it. So let\'s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45 year low. And something I\'m very proud of: African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.Small business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hard working Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take home pay starting next month a lot more.We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn\'t afford Government ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone, thank heavens. Great job.We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They\'ve just finished the best year in their 20 year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. It\'s a good feeling.One of Staub\'s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hard working Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\' education. Corey, please stand. And he\'s a great welder. I was told that by the man that owns that company that\'s doing so well. So congratulations, Corey.Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it\'s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States just a little while ago.This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you\'ve been or where you\'ve come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.Tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, "In God We Trust." And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12 year old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a job well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special, that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you\'ve done, Preston. Thank you very much.Preston\'s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that\'s what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America\'s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that\'s what\'s happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven\'t seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one. And we haven\'t seen this in a long time. It\'s all coming back.Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They\'re coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That\'s where they want to be.Exciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country\'s history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It\'s time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. Right?One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it\'s very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we\'re getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they\'ll be good ones, but they\'ll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year. Isn\'t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.Tonight I\'m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it.Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart and American hands and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\'s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.As tax cuts create new jobs, let\'s invest in workforce development, and let\'s invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let\'s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let\'s support working families by supporting paid family leave.As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at life.Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They\'ve allowed millions of low wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\'s 16th birthday such a happy time it should have been neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.Six members of the savage MS 13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\'s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\'s high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS 13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents these are great people; these are great, great people that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America\'s children, America\'s struggling workers, and America\'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by "D.J." and "C.J." He said, "Call me either one." So we\'ll call you "C.J."  Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job.At one point, MS 13 leaders ordered C.J.\'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS 13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done, we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS 13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate you, C.J. You\'re a brave guy. Thank you very much.And I asked C.J., "What\'s the secret?" He said, "We\'re just tougher than they are." And I like that answer.  Now, let\'s get Congress to send you and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no choice. C.J., we\'re going to send you reinforcements, and we\'re going to send them to you quickly. It\'s what you need.Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12 year period.The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release.The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It\'s time to begin moving toward a merit based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It\'s time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down the middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let\'s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail.As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He\'s here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Thank you, Ryan.Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn\'t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: "You will do it, because you can." He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.As we rebuild America\'s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2.5 hours and through emergency surgery.Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin\'s selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated, and Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a "V" for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including the ISIS leader, al Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released. So today I\'m keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis who is doing a great job, thank you to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\'s sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign assistance dollars always serve American interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea\'s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.Otto Warmbier was a hard working student at the University of Virginia, and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.Otto\'s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto\'s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Tonight we pledge to honor Otto\'s memory with total American resolve. Thank you.Finally  thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Sung ho. In 1996, Sung ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he\'d met any Christians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.Today, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a new leg. But, Sung ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you\'ve come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. Sung ho\'s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol this living monument this is the monument to the American people.Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!The President. We\'re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents, medics and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it\'s the people who are making America great again.As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.Thank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.
Donald Trump
Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.  As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.  It is the agenda of the American people.Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:  to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation\'s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America\'s interests first.There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.  Victory is not winning for our party.  Victory is winning for our country.This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America\'s mission, and the power of American pride.In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade   the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.  On D Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.  Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:  Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.  Gentlemen, we salute you.In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.  Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:  Buzz Aldrin.  This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.  Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.  An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution   and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.  We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\'s future.  The decision is ours to make.We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom   a boom that has rarely been seen before.  We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs   something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.  Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.  Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all time low.  More people are working now than at any time in our history 157 million.We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty and to give critically ill patients access to life saving cures, we passed right to try.My administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.We have unleashed a revolution in American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the state of our union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone   almost double what was expected.  An economic miracle is taking place in the United States   and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn\'t work that way!We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.  Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first time non violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.Alice\'s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.In June, I commuted Alice\'s sentence and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.When I saw Alice\'s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.Inspired by stories like Alice\'s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community. The First Step Act gives non violent offenders the chance to re enter society as productive, law abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead.  America is a nation that believes in redemption.We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: Welcome home.As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.No issue better illustrates the divide between America\'s working class and America\'s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery.Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.The savage gang, MS 13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS 13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they\'re going to keep streaming back in.Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.I\'ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra\'s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon\'s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison.To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand:  few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.  When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.  At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.  Elvin says:  "If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I\'ve done my job." Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.My administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall but the proper wall never got built. I\'ll get it built.This is a smart, strategic, see through steel barrier not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation\'s most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let\'s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.As we work to defend our people\'s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don\'t blame China for taking advantage of us I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried until now.Our new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement or USMCA will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America\'s crumbling infrastructure.I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions.Already, as a result of my administration\'s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.  In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.  Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: "Last Day of Chemo."  Grace   you are an inspiration to us all.Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life saving research.To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America\'s children. I am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\'s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\'s womb.Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children born and unborn are made in the holy image of God.The final part of my agenda is to protect America\'s national security.Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.As part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state of the art missile defense system.Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America\'s interests.For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can\'t in which case, we will outspend and out innovate all others by far.As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months.  If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.  Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam.Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.Our approach is based on principled realism not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel and proudly opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.As a candidate for president, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation\'s power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: We vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.My administration has acted decisively to confront the world\'s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.Just months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.  Timothy has just had his 12th surgery but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: We are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah\'s 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah\'s family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: "It\'s the Americans."A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. "To me," Joshua recalls, "the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman\'s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth.  Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua:  Your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.Why did they do it? They did it for America they did it for us.Everything that has come since our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.Think of this Capitol think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us!  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.  Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come.  We have not yet begun to dream.We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.This is the time to re ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.This is our future our fate and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America\'s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!Thank you. God bless you, God bless America, and good night!']
