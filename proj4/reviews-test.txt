i've never had these before until recently. i ordered a set and it worked so well that i bought a couple more. the couple more that came in had a wider slot on them. i thought that was weird but didn't think to much about it until i started moving some pics around. turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well. this picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones. 3
well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...it's exactly what you would expect from behringer, it works...it's not great but it get's the job done, i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but it's still pretty useful for less than $25i don't regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withdanelectro d-8 fab 600ms delaywell, maybe next time...i give it a 3 out of 5, it wasn't this time behringer surprised me. 3
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price. well-designed and reliable, i highly recommend these. thanks to amazon for offering this great product. 5
if you need a well made cable in a short length, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend these.  buy one now. 5
got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my m-audio profire 2626 to control midi in pro tools. works great! firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility. 5
monster cable is one of the things on earth we can count on!seriously speaking all my cables are monsters, yes they are pricy and sometimes very much, true.but they last really lifetime and i never ever had to complain or heard a friend complaining on monster products.peace 5
i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. the sound i get from the ad&g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. the strings seem to hold up well. i cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. these strings sound great, i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing. 5
got this for a 15 year old learning guitar.  they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner.  my, how things change when you can see what is really going on.  recommended. 5
i almost always play finger style without a pick, but on the occasion i need a pick i like these.easier to strum sounds good to me.if you're doing a lot of picking out individual strings, you'll probably want something thicker, but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good, plus pick out a few strings here and there. 5
i usually use gibson vintage nickle strings on my electric guitars but when i had an opportunity to try theses strings out i jumped at the chance. i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p-90 pickups. i had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed. they had some great &#34;spank&#34; and sounded great. easy to play (they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9's but sounded like tens). i am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the gibson strings. next i want to try a set on a strat and see how they sound - i suspect they will sound and play great! 5
as i said on my last dunlop strap reviewi love the dunlop guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product i have 4 or 5 of them.when i buy a guitar i buy a dunlop strap and strap locks always to protect my investment. 5
i expected this to come with a dc adapter. nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn't be any or i could have ordered one. the product is good, surprisingly loud. the bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles (once the battery popped out by itself when i played a low e) but that's no issue. i have only used it with a 9v battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain. i hope that doesn't happen with an adapter. it's a nice little amp, good for carrying around. if you have long fingers, you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it's height - it's that small! a guitar strap, a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it. the distortion it gives is good. not good for palm muting. this is nice for practising randy rhoads, the doors -type of rock where not many effects are used.also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner -. many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one. it's easy to change the polarity, open the box of the adapter and exchange (needs soldering, obv) the red and the black wire places! 4
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these. my teacher really likes the high beams, but these are half the price, and the tone is just great and, surely a new set of these are going to have more &#34;oomph&#34; than a set of high beams i keep a little too long because they cost more. . .  recommended. 5
these picks are a good change of pace. they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers. good investment for the price. 5
bought it after read reviews. i had signal loss using these cables.. it's like having a loose connection inside the cable. my connections were on and off, i thought i had a dead pedal.. i have to wiggle and hold to get signal. it's too flexible almost like twizzlers (no kidding!). if you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from pro co, i bought it very cheap from sweetwater on ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable! 1
what can you say... at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! i was looking for a very inexpensive version of the popular sansamp, and this does it for me.  decent svt, flip top or "fat tube" tone, and a nice quiet di.  i go di to the house, and the output into my old seymour duncan amp/aguilar gs410 cab. great tone!! i'm using a 9vdc class ii wall wart (found it in my "spare parts" closet) vs 9v batteries.  with the wall wart, no di hum = great! does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply. never use the foot switch; if used at all, i use my finger.  if broken or lost(who would steal it?), i'd buy another in a heart beat! 4
i just got these to collect not to use to play with. they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff. 5
just a great strap. a straight up product well worth the money. man, it's good to buy something from someone who puts their name, labor, and product on the line. then delivers! here it is..you want it, come get it. can't miss dealing like that. thank you. 5
this guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box.  i am a beginner guitarist, so please take this review for what it's worth.  i am extremely pleased, and don't plan on ever upgrading.  this guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture.  so expect it to be a different color than what you order.  see customer pics.it comes with strings installed and almost tuned.  the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use.  the tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you're not going to accidently hit it while strumming.  my only gripe is that the high e string gets caught on the top pickup when i'm playing hard, but maybe i'm just a novice.  i will say that it's very easy to play.everything on it is very adjustable which i also like.  the only buyer beware statement i can think of is: you're going to be addicted to it! 5
the only complaint i have about this is that there's no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over. this probably doesn't matter to all of y'all though. other than that, it's a very nice machine with a flashing light and two &#34;click&#34; options. easy to use and quality built.  ~pegleg~ 4
i'd read a lot about the one spot power system.  i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this.  it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet.  i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards...i may swamp them out fo this one.  highly recommend it. 5
i had read many reviews on sm57 clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job. it seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone. the gls es57. (same with the sm 58/es58). i had to give it a shot. i run the sound for local bands and i use sm's because they can take abuse and still sound great. only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far i really like it. the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said. a little less bass but that doesn't mean it is a thin sound - it certainly is not. i can get it to sound the same as the sm if i eq it slightly but i like the natural sound anyway. also, the signal is a bit hotter but i really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments. value for money it can't be beat. if you are on a budget, get one.... 5
i maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since i no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me! take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy! 5
they costed twice as much as my usual d'addarios but after 2 weeks of use, i couldn't be any happier. i've heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why. they are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright, clean, and crisp. they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier. a great buy overall. 5
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...broken! ok...i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.of course,i could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase! 1
i definately helps cut down &#34;wind whistle&#34; on my mic. can't say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad. it does what it is suppose to 3
it's oil....what more do you want?turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion. immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away. let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.it's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary. don't saturate the fretboard and walk away, wood absorbs oil, too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling, losing shape and flatness. not a good situation.lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby. it's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean....like your frets...hint hint.just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper. 4
i had been leery about leaving my fender 5 string custom jazz bass on guitar stands until i met the hercules gs414b.  the stand is "built like a tank" with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly.  my bass weighs about 9.5 pounds with the strap and with its long neck, fits perfectly in the hercules, with the body of the bass resting  well-balanced against the padded legs.the design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and i experimented with trying to tip the bass over. it will take more than  an "accident" to tip the bass off its stand.  the self-closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock.the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism.  the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand.my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism. i would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black. 5
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy... now if i can just decide where to adhere it, to my guitar or my music stand?  or to the desk where i sit and play?  maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument...  yeah, i think a few of these would be nice. 5
these are super strings. they will last and last and last, and give you great sound. easy to put on and tune. 5
this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos.  i'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  i'm not sure how it's possible.  i've already outlined below in my original review that these are not jim dunlop capos.  i had purchased two, which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them.  i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. both capos had this very same problem.when i received these capos, i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos.  the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos.  the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  as a professional musician, i need to purchase reputable brand-name products because i can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  when i contacted the seller, they were not honest with me. 1
fast fret, or at least some kind of string cleaner is a 'must have' for anyone who plays guitar. because, if you think about it, strings get really dirty over time, and this product solves that issue. :) 5
like many modern capos, this has an unwieldy look to it that i don't like, but once i get past that, this is a top-notch capo that is as good as it gets for capos. i play several very different stringed instruments (guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin, tenor banjo and irish bouzouki), and i like having a capo that i can use on all of them. this is ideally suited for guitar, but holds its own on all the other instruments. i particularly like that there's nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way. i can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck.i really like that fact that it's adjustable, and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin. i also really like themeideal mcapo10 bronze guitar / banjo / mandolin capoas my 'all purpose' capo, and i own several of these because they're inexpensive and just a great product. but this is definitely my new guitar capo, and will replace the meideal in my case. great product, solidly built, and it's a bonus that you can add the micro tuner to the bottom of it.the construction appears to be very solid, and the finish is a flat black baked-on paint (or so it appears). might be some sort of powder-coating as well. the top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber, and the spring seems very strong with great tension. as noted, it will accept a d'addario micro tuner on the bottom, and includes the bracket for mounting it. 5
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier! these can't support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily. they sure are portable though. not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny! 4
the title says it all.  there is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive!  i've been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems!  if you're looking for some good trs cables....look no further!! 5
nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right now.it is a single strip of leather with no padding.maybe it just needs to be broken in.compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well.for the record, this strap is actually quite long - even in the second strap hole.i am about 5'9" and a trim 155 lbs.at the shortest setting i can manage, the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when i am sitting.update 2011-jul-31: the strap is still rather stiff.i will probably pick up a white cotton strap.those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently, in my opinion. 4
i like this product. the screen is big and easily read. the meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle, the note (sharp or flat) and by the background color going green to red. it takes 2-3 seconds to 'hear' the string but then it locks right in for all notes, even the low e.  it's really easy to use and i'm really happy with it. its so much better than my korg ca-1.  the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel. it takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position. an additional swivel would make it perfect 5
i have had and tried about every compressor out there.  lastly the old standard dyna comp. only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone.  blah.  this is a very transparent compressor.  i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric.  low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11:00.  it gives wonderful string balance and sustain. at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds. and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone.  none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string.  just balance and sustain.  as close to a rack mount as it gets. the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues.  from here you can get any type of compression you want or need.  mine has a white case. 5
is this guraunteed for life or something?  it should be for the price.  it is very basic, tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up.  i would not buy another one at the prices they charge, but then, i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to.  the carry bag is very nice, the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff.  they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it, they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between.  if you look at the picture there appears to room for 6 pedals but 5 is all you will get.  i have a boss rx-20 double pedal looper, and 2 other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables. 3
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands. if you have the smaller "screw headed" ends on your microphone stand, you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing. (maybe a dollar, if they don't just give it to you.)using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places, as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way.no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out, getting in the way, plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made, very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them.the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight.the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera.the set screw presses against a ball-socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile. i am very careful not to over-tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob.i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing, but at this price i guess you can't expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism, eh?there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a 90-degree preset angle.the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera.be careful. the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting, removing or switching cameras. i found a little 'plastic threaded washer-like ring' that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use. you could easily find many types of washers, screws, plastic pieces, etc., to hold it in place when in storage or transport. you could also leave it attached to your camera. either way, be careful not to let it fall out and get lost.overall the "little thing" is quite solid, heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small, basic, solid and inexpensive.it holds well when bumped or moved. mine has absolutely "no slop" in it, does not wobble or come loose. i would not put a larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter. most modern devices will do just fine.again, just make sure you tighten it up 'just enough' to hold it well. don't put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years. mine has.i'm happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas.hope this helps! 4
i like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments- i run this through a furman pedal board and there is little to no noise - for the money this is a good product- 5
works really well, was a great price, and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time. the capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar. 5
i'm not a performing musician, so i actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand.  holds everything from a .5mm nylon pick to a 3.1mm rubber pick, and i have yet to see one fall out.  simple solution to a simple problem. 5
hey i got this and an "ovation idea" from go-dps. i couldnt be happier with these items, especially the "ovation idea" !!!!!!i have to brag on "go-dps" some, they are wonderfull dealers; i look forward to buying from go-dps again. 5
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic.  would need a heavier base for use with a boom. 4
holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar 5
just recieved my stand. it fits the mandolin perfect,it also fits my wifes ukelele--- so i ordered a second one this morning. its made very well. is compact once its folded up. the price was  awesome.i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment. thank -you so much 5
this is the first harmonica i ever used. i did some research and ended up with the special 20 in the key of c. i have no basis for comparison and i am a beginner but this instrument sounds awesome! the construction is perfect and the included case is very appreciated : ) for $25 i can't complain! 5
these are solid, good build quality and really do get the job done well.easily adjustable, versatile in design and function, get em! 5
i am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings. this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard .... and even my bass. the cd input has no controls but is a very useful feature just the same. having behringer mics and a ub802 mixer, i banked on this being a good amp and was not disappointed. the 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument. no 15-watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings.... and do not expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you. every musician should have one of these around. money well spent! 5
this product is great. you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals. read the description so you can have a sense of size. tue quality is very nice, solid and resistible. the soft case is very nice also. 5
i put these on an epiphone les paul acoustic-electric and it sounds so great. they are very smooth and warm and magical, like a mythical unicorn. 5
not quite as good as the red all instrument snark, but it gets the job done and the price is right. 4
if you love delay and want variety, this is your pedal.  i run two amps when i play (often) and the ping pong is delightful for me.  however, in the studio, this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options.  being toneprint enabled is a 100% plus.  very clean, quiet, and durable.  excellence! 5
this does work as described.  it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out.  the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable!  its quite hard on your collarbone.  i have added foam to it and now it works well, but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place. 2
i'm glad i tried these, i wont order them again. i thought they might be a good alternate for my dunlop nylon picks, not really though.edit: im nothing if not fair. my last review of these was in the context of my playing my strat or sometimes my 335. i stand by that review. however, now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. in the end these are the picks i reach for when im playing the godin.i will buy these again. i changing my review from 'just okay' to "contextually perfect". ok i'll add a star, your right i should add a star. there! 4
this is not my only capo, but it's my cheapest.  it works as well as other more expensive ones.  this one was a good deal through amazon.com. 5
i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan. i was going to get the martin backpacker, which i have actually seen and held in a store, but other reviews sold me on this washburn. the case was a particular positive point for me, and so was the 25% lower price. i am more than please with what i have received. the case is great for a traveling soldier, rugged and protective, with useful pockets. the guitar itself is very well made, nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument. it does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body, common to the type, as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold, since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body, and you can't exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic. the thing is, this guitar is just plain fun, it is always handy, durable, and plays pretty well. best buy i have made on a product i couldn't try out first. a testament to the quality of the reviews on amazon, which have rarely led me astray. 5
this tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tune.it is good deal for the money 3
works great, does what it should, holds all my guitars securely.  acoustic and electric, but not at the same time.  haha 5
this is an amazing guitar for the price. i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection. the guitar has good tone and action. the built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently.  the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in.  the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud.  the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified, but i prefer the acoustic sound.  the finish is a bit more orange than pictured. you could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one. 4
this is a black sponge for smaller mics.  i got mine for use with some behringer mics.  at first, i didn't think they would fit, but it just took a bit of stretching.  they fit really snug, which is excellent because they won't fall off or slide around on the mic causing noise.  they do what they're supposed to do. 5
i bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. they've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets, that i've used. i figured i'd save a bit and get a couple more from amazon. i got them fast and saved twenty bucks. they do fine with my fairly heavy fender and st blues guitars as well as my p bass. they are middle of the road for price and width, but give me no comfort issues at all. my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. super tight and easy to lower. raising it is a different story though. i just save the fast &#34;lower played&#34; songs for last. those are the best ones anyway. excellent strap. 5
this cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. would like to purchase another one in the future. buy it! it's worth it 5
we've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. when i see the word microfiber i always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.this cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing i've tried before. with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.this would be great for any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.reasonably priced too. 5
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what i'd been searching for...for years i played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system. the rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards, blah blah blah... but these days everything i have sits on a furman spb-8c pedal board (highly recommended) and so i've been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor, and that is harder to find than i had previously imagined... apparently they aren't easy to make..? i've been through 4 (coun't 'em four) foot pedal compressors and wasn't at all happy... an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal mxr csp202 - so i did - and it's perfect...benefits:1) it's easy to match your output gain on the pedal - so when you step on it - the pedal activates quality compression and not output volume suppression2) it's easy to understand right away - 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and you're done - 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3) it's quiet but very effective and professional sounding4) it's solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionnegatives:1) it's expensive considering there are compression pedals for 1/2 this price2) it's got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackover all the thing is a home run - you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection - you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to, but you can't fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one... i highly recommend this pedal, after a long process of searching and being disappointed i'm glad i found this pedal 5
fit my mim strat perfectly, not much else to say.  always buy fender parts for fender guitars, dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay, they wont fit. 5
i've had this thing for several weeks, and just now, when it fell off the table for the 100th time, i tossed it in the trash.  the whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber, it's not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck, and it's not heavy enough to stay put.  even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over.  unless you glue this thing to the table, or something like that, it's useless, even worse than useless, it's in the way.addendum:  i raised the rating a bit, after hearing from the distributor/manufacturer ... at least these guys listen. 3
simple. effective.  just what i wanted.  seems a tad flimsy, but, time will tell.  tuning couldn't be easier.  neat product. 5
works great - very good feel - we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetmy wife loves it - if i needed two i would buy another 5
love the ukulele,  and the book is okay,, shows cords but the songs are very outdated,,  you tube is your friend when learning the uku...update : i got a tenor uku for xmas adn bought a concert uku just because, i love them both more than this little guy although it does travel with me and i just forked out money for a hardshell case so it wont get beat up as much in my suitcase by american airlines,( just ruined my suitcase)anyhow,  it has been going out of tune for awhile now ( c string fattest one)  and i just figured out my bridge is lifting, there are two rivets holding it down and there is a board inside although not a very thick one,,will be putting a new piece on the inside and some good wood glue under the bridge and let it dry,,,  if the bridge falls apart again, i will be smashing the box and making a banjo uku with the neck,,if you think you are really going to like playing, go for a concert or tenor,,  if you are liking the size spend a bit of money, this is pretty much the same as my grand daughters 20 dollar ebay ukulele i bought myself 4 years ago and gave to my 3 yo grand daughter because that one too would not stay in tune. 5
i am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far i get a big punch aout of it . i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine. i am running a dj karaoke system. i also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable. item received looks diferent i say better. 5
...but it works fine for me.i used to connect a orange micro terror head amporange amplifiers micro terror mt20 20w hybrid guitar amp head (standard)to a cabinet ppc108orange ppc108 1x8" speaker cabinet 4
i ordered this product on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday. came very well packaged and with all the pieces. i was very easy to assembly and looks great! for the price, you really can't go wrong with this guitar stand. works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won't fall off. padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. great stand for the price!!! 5
i'll be honest here - i bought this one primarily because of its looks.  not a lot of white clip-on tuners around. i also own an sn-8 and in comparing the two, the sn-13 seems to be as tight, but it's only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the sn-8 (which has more features) for a few dollars less than what you're paying for the sn-13.  still, it's a typical snark.  it registers very quickly, it's easy to read, and you don't have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration. the stem on mine is a little looser than i would prefer but it still stays in position.my only real gripe isn't unique to this model but to all snarks.  the curved stem combined with the round head means it won't sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren't exactly robust, so i'm always concerned that one day i'm going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces.  other than that, i'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner. 4
even though the title says "acoustic guitar case", it's obvious that this is a case for a-style mandolins. i chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo, and the reviews were good. sure enough, the lining is soft and well-padded. the hardware works as it should, and the build quality is almost perfect. however, when closing the case, a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place, then everything is as it should be. the case fits my a-type mandolin perfectly, and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. the slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. it serves its purpose well, at a reasonable price. 4
whatever the name, this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp. the packaging description says it uses the jrc4558 chip and ma150 diodes, and yes, behringer got the sound right. i'd say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals. what i love about this pedal is the tone knob. for the ts pedals in this price range, it's the most useful. you can set it high, and it isn't too icepicky, yet the entire range is useful. this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound.i prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal, or another overdrive. it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones. it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones.i bought this pedal to "semi-retire" an older ibanez ts5 soundtank. the switch on that one isn't as good as the behringer's. the behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off. i use mainly solid state fender amps, and several distortion pedals (including a boss metal zone). i'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt. the only downside is the slight lack of bass. if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups (esp. 2x12 and 4x12), or a distorted tone with plenty of bass, this shouldn't be a problem. 5
this works great for mic'ing guitar amps. the stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp. 5
ok - i like this one a lot.  it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime.  it is accurate, easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing.  it sure beats the other units i have used where you clamp on some weird thing, tune up and then stash back in your gig bag.this one is... bing! - on, tune and back to playing.  it weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up. 5
i absolutely love these picks. grips really well in your hand, plays like a dream. i just wish more came in the pack. i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks. 5
i've bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet.  they all work flawlessly.  i'll definitely buy more and highly recommend them.  just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper (asian made). 5
i've almost exclusively used earnie balls and d'addarios since i was a kid,and have always been satisfied. i've taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately. the d'addarios are excellent strings, and this price on the 10-pack was unbeaten,anywhere. 5
i bought one of these used that was just like new when i got it.  the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele.  the build quality, the aquila strings, and the tuning keys are very high quality.  you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time.  i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way.  it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles.i bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers. some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets.  i am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one. 5
i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig.i am a bass player by trade, though i dabble with many other instrument (as many of us do). i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows, when the sound system is adequate, via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di.around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there. for being a thin flexible cable, i notice no noise issues or interference problems.i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal, (which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals) and then to the mixer. i use the at 10' xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show, then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc.the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment, unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables. this cable, at least in its 10' form, sounds just as good as my mogami silver 25' xlr. i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic. i have several. i don't have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables.on short, i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike. 5
it hold my picks well, but some are to big for it and the tape/foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly. im neutral on this one. 3
we have an old acoustic around the house, but i rarely play it, opting instead for the electric. this is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.when we put these new strings on the guitar (lotus), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible--bright and clear.these are fairly pricey, but i am very impressed with the quality. 5
i have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it. i could never quite get the fine tune i was looking for, and i have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear. these little tuners are amazing. so easy to use, and portable, and cheap. i have several now, one for every guitar. cheap is important, because they are made of plastic and i have had one break at the joint after a lot of use. i also received one without a battery, which upset me at the time. i am in afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by. if you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money. 5
great recorder on so many levels.i use it for external audio recording for dslr video.i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics.dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible.not intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functions.something i will have to get used to. 4
really perfect as advertised.  experienced player might have other choices, but for me, it was easy to use and exactly met its purpose. 5
i love this tuner. it is accurate & very reasonably priced. i have ordered this tuner for  fellow musician friends & all of them love them. best clip on tuner i have ever purchased. 5
while i have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting.  after using the zoom h4n for a few weeks i've found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster's arsenal of gear.i mainly use the h4n to record my podcasts using a allen & heath zed14 mixing board.  i usually do a two person podcast where i am in one location and the other person is brought in via skype.  using the aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the h4n i can record myself in one channel, the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my ipad into its own stereo channel.  this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track.the sound quality of the h4n is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit.  you can hook up either two xlr microphones or two 1/4&#34; jack sources (or a combination) to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1/8&#34; input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source.  it's the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracks.the h4n will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well, which could be useful if you're looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed.overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field, letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments.  five stars without a doubt. 5
i have to say i was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but i was shocked at the sounds i could get.it took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone i wanted and off we went.for the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone  is worth twice as much.as far as durability i have had in a month used it 10 times, so far so good.i did purchase the protection plan for $10 so i'm covered for 2 years. 5
i don't put these on every guitar but on the right guitar they are perfect.  what's the right guitar?  longer scales- like a strat.  i would not put these on a shorter scale (22") because it would get too flubby.  if you hit the power chords hard you may also want to stear clear-  these require a bit more subtlety in your attack or you will vibrate in and out of tune on the low e when you are pulling off windmills like townshend.  they do allow super  easy string bends for when i feel lazy or for when my fingers are torn up from playing.  ymmv. 5
this mighty bright is  great!!!!  it clips to my music stand, has battery power or ac adapter ( included) and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare. if you need a light for reading music or for just reading, this is it......... 5
it's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from, very good value at only $10 not counting shipping, very satisfied. 5
works smoothly, built like a tank and looks good as well. i've tried other passive volume pedals that didn't work...this one works. worth every penny. 5
my guitar originally came with d'addrio exp and they sounded good. i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. this time i got a 3 pack of ej16-3d light. the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.but the sound is the problem. it's terrible. they sound very muddy. crisp tone distinction is just not there. i thought light would be the better route, but now i'm not sure. i purchased some others to try. also, since a purchased a 3 pack. i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings. 2
what can i say?  it's a cable.  it's cheap, and it works as advertised.  much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops.  gold tips, yeah, right! 5
yes, this pedal is plastic, the switch is not the most durable feeling, and the knob placement is annoying.  at less than $15, you need to be able to look past these things.  i've had a higher failure rate with the dunlop cry baby and that thing is built like a cinder block.  this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended. which is to say, this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier.  no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going.  no overdrive pedal lives up to it's potential running into a solid state (even modeling) amplifier.  it's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy. some have complained about rf interference with the use of the fab pedals (getting radio signals through your amp).  i have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the fab- particularly when running a long pedal chain.  based on tone alone, this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $100.  check out the youtube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by 'intheblues'.  i believe he uses a drri with a strat, and this pedal sounds great.  if you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $100 you may be surprised- particularly if your other gear (amp and guitar) are halfway decent.  what i did note though, was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other ts type pedals.  that doesn't make it worse or better- just different.  the 'mid-hump' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer, which is a good thing imho.  there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market!  it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers.  incidentally, the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes.  since it isn't true bypass, you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain, but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine.  lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review- i've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used 'vintage' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced.  i am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear.  ymmv- 4
i use this mostly with my honeytone mini amplifier and reel echo tape echo simulator. works very well with no problems. a lot of danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to ac voltage outlets. 5
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable. i have to take my glasses off when i use them, but other than that exactly what i thought they'd be when i ordered them. 4
***update*** after heavy play for 6 months, this is my favorite amp by a mile. i also have a zt lunchbox that i use for church work (miles of clean headroom and designed specifically for pedals). the mustang iii would work just fine, but i can throw the zt in a backpack with my pedals (i only use an od, chorus and reverb for church) and it has a lot more volume of i do youth group stuff outside and can't mic up.i have several friends that play music as a primary source of income and 3 of them purchased the mustang for it's overall lightweight, terrific sound and low price. played on the clean channels (settings 88-99) with pedals will give you an amazing tone that lets you forget it's not a tube amp - and for the most part, the crowd is clueless to begin with. i did purchase the vox ac4 and it was so one dimensional and limited it went right back. terrific for gigs or practice, a back up or just beginning guitar.so this is the 3rd amp i've purchased in a very short amount of time. i traded in my line 6 and also purchased a roland micro cube. chalk it up to a new guitar player and a whole world of amplifiers from every price range and style. i bought the line 6 becuase it had a lot of features and presets that i thought would be really fun. they are, but line 6 is for metal, despite "you can play anything on it" marketing. turns out i really enjoy playing country and blues (although i listen to punk, classic rock and metal (pre-1995).enter the mustang iii. it also is feature loaded, but with one kicker. the models of the vintage fender amps. i have a very close friend that plays a 65' twin reverb - he was shocked at the modeling. the bassman is another that is just off the charts good. the lcd screen is bigger and overall very simple to use. the vox model is also really jangly sounding - like it's supposed to. i have to add that with vox in particular, you can get the crunch without having to use massive volume. this is true of modeling amps across the board and a huge advantage over tubes in general. for $300 you can get a vox w/ an overdrive, delay and reverb. and you can get the full effect with the volume dialed to 3, not 11. it doesn't sound exactly like a vox - but i don't gig. i'm a basement rockstar - the mustang gets it done without any problems.adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive. that's without the fuse software. i'm not big into recording, so i'm content using it from the  lcd, but the fuse software is slick. the virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp. the screen is easy to navigate and you can see exactly what effects you're using where they are set at.the only reason i've given it 4 stars is beacuse is lacks low end punch and more importantly doesn't quite have the warmth of a tube amp. to be clear - tube amps sound like tube amps. if you are a metal guy on a solid state budget, line 6 is still the way to go. if you're more into the old school r'n'r sounds, take a look at the mustang iii. excellent sounds and value. 4
really a remarkable microphone for around $100.  very sensitive . . . its for studio, not live performances.  be sure to set your daw insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter, as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping.  has a rich warm tone, like tube mics.  compares to a audio tech 2020, not in the class of say an audio tech 4040.  can't beat it for the price. 4
works great for the price!! i just started to get into pedals and i thought i'd try something cheap like this, and i was not dissatisfied. don't mistake this for a distortion pedal for those who are new to all this, although you can get a distorted tone for this pedal, it just boosts the volume with slight raise in gain (for those who do know your shit please don't call me out on that, i don't really know and i'm just helping ones like me in simple terms,lol). it works great for switching to a more abrasive tone for solo'ing or just wanting to get loud in your songs.definitely would pick this one up for a super cheap &#34;i just wanna try it&#34; pedal. 5
i bought this just to see if i might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (i'm gettin' old...lol)would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice.  i wouldn't say it's agreat instrument but way more than i expected for $60.  after i changed the strings,(i used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound.  i bought anew bow (for &#62;$100, so...) and found i like the one that came with it at least as much.the case is excellent...i'll prob use it with my upgrade.so for the price, you really get far more than you pay for.p.s.- the shoulder rest is kinda useless though. 4
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds-1 . great chrunch for the buck from classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in. 5
this is a great guitar once you change the strings, as suggested. great portability for the price.however - having read reviews across multiple sites, i too am a victim of the horrible glue smell that so many others have complained about. i really liked the guitar, so i purhcased it from two separate retailers, but had to return both due to the horrific smell. i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a "smell-free" case... and they sent a case. but it stunk too. it's a shame, i had to return them, because they were nice little guitars. 3
planet waves ns artist capo is as near perfect a capo that i've ever come across. i've been a kyser capo gal for many, many years but, this capo has that one beat by a mile. there was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars i tried it on or which fret i placed it on. as i strummed each string to sound was so clear. it's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open, without any stress to your hand, until you release your grip to clamp it into place.i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever! and the price ain't so bad either. 5
just received the cable, it sounds clear, doesn't feel like it is made of the best materials, i just got this cable today so i can't really comment on how durable it is and how long it will last, so far i tend to believe it is a decent cable for the price, i don't use a microphone very often so this cable should last a while. so far it is working well, i would buy another one if i needed it, the price is right, 3
there's not much to say about this product, except that it works. it makes my strings last longer. sometimes i get lazy owning so many guitars, and 20 minutes per &#34;well done&#34; restring adds up. this is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible. it's small and conveniently stored too. i recommend trying it out! 5
i purchased the dr-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs, and it accomplishes that very well.  the battery life is great, the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it, and the build quality is pretty solid.  my only issue is the internal mics, while crystal clear in terms of quality, can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things.  in addition, they are very susceptible to wind, even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air.  i highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery. 4
i bought this case for my rogue a-style electric mandolin.the inside is nicely lined; the hardware is solid.it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap.i recommend this to anyone with an a-style mandolin.jafmusicmix 5
simply put, this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp. gave the amp more low-end and made everything much clearer. i would, and do, recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their super champ sound. and, like other people have said, the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting. i had to turn the amp down two notches (two number) to have the same volume level out of the amp.if my super champ was stolen, i'd buy a new one and put this speaker in it. wouldn't even think twice about it. 5
i'm mainly a guitarist but i do play bass from time to time on an old fender american. these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear, smooth sound. i love the tone you get out of these, very bluesy and the punch isn't too rough it's just right. i'm a huge fan of d'addario, been using their strings for at least 4 years and they never disappoint. give these a try if you're looking for some new strings. 5
got a cleaner/polish/wax type ointment for every part of your guitar. comes with a small rag, and fret polishing pad deal....the fret pad is great and i didn't know about this type of thing till getting this kit. also comes with a step by step/stage by stage instruction pamphlet. worth it to get this kit and replace /add to it as needed. 5
i've had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great. took a while for me to learn all the things that the jam can do since i was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when i received it. crank this baby up and it moves air. i've used all the in's and out's with no problems. my rig consists of an ibanez as73, schecter devil custom 2008, line 6 hd500, and an akg perception 420 thru a line 6 ux2. finally, i only play at home so this gear doesn't get banged up from gigging.i agree here> (as b. russell said: the only downside i can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged. there are a lot of features on this amp, but you need to learn how to use them. the common features are easy to use, but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp, you will need to invest some time into it. since i'm not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual, this amp fits me well.) 5
easy to use - it was easy to put the picks in and to take the picks out of it. 5
i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john  view tips and guidelines | headline & 20 more words required./// 5
this is what i'm talking about: cheap but very usual form behringer. very handy too. but i hope then would run on batteries next time. 4
this is a nice pick holder, especially for the price. it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use. 5
total flimsy junk. it leans wayyy too far back. i'll be damned if i put my $1000 guitars on these things. on the other hand, chromacast makes one that's very close to this price, and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid.in summary... do not buy this piece of junk. 1
i've had this pedal since the mid-90's, when i started playing in my teens.  while an eq might seem like an odd choice for a beginner's pedal selection, i was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap crate and marshall amps i used back then.  since i have better equipment now, i haven't used it as much.however, as simple as it is, it is definitely a useful tool.  you can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs.  or, you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts.the only negatives i recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise (but not so much that you couldn't trap it with a noise gate), and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit.  again, nothing that can't be fixed with other effects.  and if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment, it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well.i give it 5* despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and boss products are built rock solid.  i'll have this thing forever. 5
this thing rocks! unlike other cheap chinese-made ripoffs (ahem... behringer) these joyo products are well made, inexpensive and worth every penny. 4
a nice little amp to rock out with... so it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all i asked. 5
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all.  it's comfortable and sturdy.  what else could you want in a guitar strap? 5
wuhan makes great products for the money. i have the 18&#34; medium crash and so i decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck. if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the 60's or 70's. nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals,  with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash. will review each one as they come in from amazon. why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like i am, go for wuhans. i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash. wuhan really impresses me. there are some great video's of wuhans on you tube, you should really check those out before buying wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter. i am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash! 4
i knew i did right by buying the dr-212. it's great and stands up to much more expensive of it's kind.i have lots of gibsons as well as epiphones and frankly i don't see any difference to speak of. if anybody wants a durable acoustic 12 string with fine sound you'll find it in the dr-212.best of luck to allregards,roger  epiphone dr-212 acoustic guitar, 12-string, natural 4
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum.  should work just fine.  i also bought the green one. 4
this levy's jacquard strap is well made and comfortable. it was much cheaper here than any other place on-line or at a brick and mortar. arrived quite quickly, but a tracking number would've been nice. otherwise, no compaints. 5
it looks fine but as other reviewers have pointed out is thinner than the oem plate that came on the guitar. some people mentioned putting shims behind it but a better idea might be to cut the ends of the neck screws down by an 1/8th of an inch so that you don't screw the neck screws in too far.  the plate was delivered on time and as promised by amazon. 5
it's the tube screamer of delay pedals. i use mine primarily to thicken up my tone, and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board. i have used it for situations that call for deep delay, and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey... i fall back on a ehx memory man chained to an anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the 2 delays in experimentation sequences, but when playing blues or thrash, i use it as tone beef only. low settings not too echo-ey, more like a bass'd out reverb.there are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal, and it is a testament to it's versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres.hey - stop reading this and order it! now!!!! 5
this works amazing! it is very thick, which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin. it also works great for a guitar. it works really nice with steel strings, but i have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings. 5
this is a great capo from shubb. the finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel. i like how it works. it adjusts to fit different guitar necks, and just sort of snaps in place. it doesn't require great force or a lot of hand strength to use this capo. the rubber parts are replaceable and with a name like shubb you know you're getting a good product. i recommend this capo to anyone. 5
the cable is great material, the 90's with boots are just right and have a lot of strength for durability.  price is right for sure. 4
clear amazing cable very underrated incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall 5
absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock--1970's influences.  i would probably buy the phase 100 today though, as it has 4 different positions to choose from, i assume including the original set-up as one of them.well, i need to correct this.  this review was for the old models.  the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified.  i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one, but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!i will probably get an eh small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too.  sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough, if at all about the sound/quality of their products.  the capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live.  god help us! 3
i was using my iphone and line 6 input but having to plug in can be a drag when you're no where near your gear. but hands down this is the most accurate, easy to use, and most portable tuner ever. i use it for all mu guitars, bass, mandolin, banjo, etc. i bought two more, you will love this tuner. 5
i already use the exl111 as my go-to electric string and tried these as part of the vine program.  i have to say i really couldn't feel the difference.  from what i can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the d string gauge is .25, whereas the same string in the exl111 set is .24.  since the string construction and plating is the same, i have to assume these will have the same longevity. i guess as long as both are still available (exl111 being phased out?) i will be selecting solely on price.  either way you can't go wrong as d'addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price. 5
regular strings. they work, and they last. they have a worm sound and i really like that, and with my takamine they sound great 4
great little amp, but get a tube amp if you're serious about playing guitar. it will sound a lot better and it's not too much more expensive. solid state just isn't the same.i'll also say that it's quite difficult to get a natural sound out of this amp without a lot of tweaking. even then, you won't get a great clean tone. the fender champ x2 is a great alternative to the more expensive and desiralble vintage fender vibro champ. go with quality and save yourself a future purchase (resale vale is great on the x2 as well). 4
this guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well. i am now a fan of takamine. their is nothing bad i can say about this guitar and i would take this guitar anywhere. this is my 4th guitar i have bought and is by far my favorite guitar. i have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic, this being the second acoustic. i wanted a cheap guitar i could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up, except i got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up. people are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish. it wasn't supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look. if this guitar was glossy it wouldn't be as nice sounds stupid but it is true. you have to see the guitar face to face to understand what i mean. this guitar i would recommend to anyone. i am trying to get my friends to buy one so can all have a acoustic guitar, lol. thank you!!!!!! 5
depends on what your looking for. is this a pog...nope, but it has some tricks up it's leave for the price. the only con i can give is when playing chords when dropping down (like a drop d) it doesn't always sound grant. bar chords work a little better 5
i love these picks and the .88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing. 4
i really like this strap.  i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar.  they're really comfortable.  they're much less bulky than most of the leather straps i've seen, so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case.i've had the original blue one i bought for about 3 years and it still looks and functions like new. 5
this should be your first pedal. for 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion. no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck. it's clean, high fidelity, and versatile as a swiss army knife. 5
these picks are nice. they're great for metal, if you like a durable pick. the paint fade away after a while, but don't let that stop you. it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me. the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time. 5
what  great idea to put all three tools needed when changing strings into one tool. the cutter even works well. 5
this stand is made of quality products.  it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right.  this is our second one as we both have guitars. worth every penny. 5
these perform well on single coils, specifically telecasters.  right now i switch back and forth between power and beefy, with fenders being my next choice followed by d'addario. 4
the dunlop guitar fingerboard kit arrived very quickly and was put to the test immediately.  i am pleased with the product.  it makes my guitar look new again.  i will definitly look into their other products.  thanks to amazon for the quick service. 4
for the price, this works really well. i see no faults. it can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now. 5
works great 5
i'm not sure how much i can say about a mute. it's easy to put on and take off, and it does its job. it mutes the violin to a reasonable level.  i used an spl meter at a distance where a sustained open g string gave a reading of about +2db. with the mute, it dropped to -6db. i then tried a yamaha silent electric violin (unplugged) and from the same distance, it barely registered. i recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about 1db, and the yamaha read about -6db at that distance and setting.so it won't make your instrument completely silent, and from a purely subjective perspective, it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin, perhaps seeming about 10 to 20% louder had i not measured it.with accessories, tonal quality is typically important. but with a mute, you expect it to deteriorate. surprisingly, there was still a lot of tone left, especially compared to the unplugged electric, yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced.you can't expect this to give great sound or complete silence, but it won't disturb the neighbors or their dogs, and it won't make the instrument sound dead. this is about 15 times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin, and the latter will probably sound worse. it's not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice. 4
these strings are the best.  haven't found any others that sound and feel so good.  they lasted 3 years and i play nearly every day for hours.  go figure!  i actually thought i didn't need to change strings (still don't know for sure) because they still sounded so good and show no wear.  anyway i decided to change the strings because it's been so long.  happy that i did however. 5
how do you review an sm58?? i've used these most of my life, and will continue to. very durable, i got this to replace the same, a 20 year old, rusted / dented grill 58 :) i also use a d5 (akg - same price) and a line 6 wirelesss, but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup. 4
that cloth... they should have included something that doesn't fall apart.otherwise it's great. i use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned, but i'm with other people here who commented that you can't really tell how much of the stuff is left inside. good idea to keep more than one of these around. 4
i'm a pro-cheapo and i hated this thing. they're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. drop few more bucks and get something else! 1
i find that if i play this pedal along with my boss super chorus pedal, my guitar with tex-mex pickups captures a lot gilmour's sound tonality. 5
these headphones get the job done. i like the build and design. very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs. 5
i needed a cheap good quality mic, and this fit the bill. bighter than the sm58 it mimics which is fine for me because my speakers stink. i bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality. there is no on/off switch, so expect that you'll shut it off at the mixer. 4
ever since i saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used jazz 3 picks, and after having tried them that he simply couldn't use an other pick.. i decided to try them out.. and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks!i always had issues holding picks and keeping them &#34;put&#34; while i played and the jazz iii was no exception so it didn't bother me..meaning i didn't really feel like there was a problem other than me, being that problem... then i read about this new ultex thingyit looked like a jazz iii and every one seemed to like it..sooo i figured why not have a go at it... i was skeptical about this &#34;impossible to drop&#34; thing which i read..so i was dieing to feel them... well they came.. i tried them and after playing for a while i didn't even notice that i hadn't once readjusted my pick..... not once ... it was like there was no pick.. i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be... it stays there... to me that's just freaking incredible! holy @#$@%# wow! i love this thing love it love it! 5
these work better than anything else i ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording, think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well. 5
i have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong.  i use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric.  great design.  i cant see how they could improve this at all. 5
yes, i think you should try these.  if you're looking at them, then get them.  they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w/o any pick experience.  i don't drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w/o looking. 5
i have an electro acoustic martin (second hand but without a scratch). i got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.i have installed a set (i got 8) and it sounds really good. not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.recomended 5
small. light weight. stunning fender blackface looks. warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive. the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up. the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me. it is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio. the direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself. what could be easier? and it mikes well too, by the way. the choice is yours there.with no led display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too. the voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates. the tweed, blackface, and marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp.love the reverb in the fx section. the spring reverb is so well done that i bumped the amp once and was looking for the "spring chrash" known from amps with the real spring reverb. it's that good. once again, the controls are easy and direct. never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort. who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? you want that, go waste your money on a line 6 or something. this champ is made for one thing. to give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort. i believe it has accomplished that well.again, a shame that fender has dropped this model from the line up of products. the super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well. i'm just glad that i got one of these from amazon. com when i did and will not part with the amp. been playing for five decades now and i know when i have a good instrument or gear and when i don't. this model is a keeper to be sure. and i don't even like digital! how's that for an endorsement? it's that good for what it does.... 5
nice strap but a bit too stiff ... might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying.  well built and good adjustability. 4
i had been learning on a squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. after doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, i chose this one.it's much easier to play than the squier, and it has a better sound. like the squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. i suspect it might need to be adjusted, but i don't have a clue as to how to go about it.it's also a good choice for women. i'm a small woman, and i really like that the neck is smaller. it's also fairly lightweight.overall, i'm happy with my choice. a guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. maybe. i expect to be happy with it for a few years before i upgrade again. 4
i wanted to like this. i really did. the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;perfect&#34;. however, the unit i received was cr@p, and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. the one i got kept cutting in and out. you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. and when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. frustrating.i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. the so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. bummer. any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?cheers 1
the question was, &#34;did it meet your expectations?&#34; and it certainly did.  it is heavy duty but also light.  well, placed on a light duty cheapo stand it might be a little heavy but and basic quality stand will handle it no problem.  it really seems well engineered and made of quality material. 5
i am impressed with d'addario's electric strings. easy to adjust to, very light on my fingers and they're built to last. with a few adjustments to my amp settings, these strings are very dynamic in their tone quality from classic to hard rock styles. any guitarist who plays electric can enjoy these strings, and they last a long time too. 5
i really feel like this thing is my personal slave, just standing off to the side, waiting to grab my guitar when i hand it off. it is reliable and rock solid. the tripod base has been very steady so far. it really is a great product.the other thing i have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the right places. i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material. and it did, but not at all the guitar contact points.i do have to laugh at the folks here and on musician's friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1. "it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward." - the basic idea is their guitar was on-stage, someone pushed the stand forward, the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground, releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor. reality: let's say the stand held onto the guitar. it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar. sometimes accidents happen. don't blame the stand. blame the moron who knocked over your guitar.2. "the guitar touches the floor." - it's not supposed to! try elevating the next, or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar.this stand is worth the extra money over those $15 disasters. spend an extra $10 and save yourself the headache. 5
if your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped x bracing, you should really get these strings. they bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the d'daddarios and they are about the same price. best of all they last extremely long, but i've broken a few strings over the past months. overall great strings and pretty consistent. 5
i admit it, my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick. hold my tab securely so i can flip though it with ease while i'm still playing my guitar. much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage. 5
this is an excellent product. i've used one of these before, and don't remember it having lock washers... this does. when you tighten this down, it actually stays tightened.for $10 you cannot go wrong with this. bear in mind that it's for a standard 10 hole diatonic harmonica, not the 16 hole chromatic style. 5
love it. makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy. quiet power supply, lots of cables and end caps and adapters, for what you'd pay for a single power adapter. it's nice not having to  dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play. about the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters, but i'm sure you can find them somewhere.good quality, and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply. 5
i have several different slides (glass, brass, steel, short, long, etc.)and this has become my go to for every slide guitar session i play on!i wear it on my ring finger, it fits great, the tone is amazing on acoustic, electric and banjo!works great for blues, rock, a little stoner country, and even some metal! (the main genres i play in)harmonics and sustain to spare!i keep it in my pocket at all times now, it goes with me everywhere, and has never failed to lay down some mojo when i bring it out! 5
dunlop 5005 pick holder, this is very handled, always forget were my pick got off too, now i know my picks is in the holder. 5
this is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos, and you get free shipping.yeah, it's not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones, but still not bad; better than an elastic strap type.it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos.  with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff.do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin. you can add a pad of some sort, or just take care to not to over-tighten it.i'm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through.  so, far it doesn't look like it will though. 5
i bought this to replace my son's previous guitar that had broken from hard use. from initial unboxing it is clear that this has been made to a much better standard. the wood looks beautiful. all the metal parts look sturdy and durable.it sounds good, although as my son is a beginner i cannot judge just how good.note that there is no guitar cable.for now i am very happy with this purchase as it looks better made than i expected. 5
when this arrived i didn't realize it was that small. thought it has to be so its out of the way. then i thought, this thing can't work very well, but it does perfectly. the first few times a used it, i wasn't expecting muchhowever, i couldn't more wrong it really works well and i would recommend this to family or friends. 5
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  i guess this kit works okay, but it's hard to use.  it will probably last my entire lifetime.  i think a smaller kit would have been better.  you really need to remove the strings when you use it, so you have to take off all the strings.  i usually only replace one string at a time when i am changing strings, so i had to change my habits.  if you have a guitar without a truss rod, that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings, since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time, and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  i'm no expert, but i have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  however, since i love my guitar, i use it anyway. 3
i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  this one is the worst.  the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  after twisting on it twice i stripped it out.  now the thing is worthless.  i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6" pop filter.  if you don't, you'll wish you did. 1
sold, great quality xlr mic. it's pretty hard to mess these up. people often build their own, but when they're this cheap, why go through the trouble? 5
i have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one.  however, it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint.  yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included.  this bracket holds the ns micro tuner, of which i have 3.  i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications.  however, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need.  a simple modification, but bordering on genius.  the capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed.  highly recommended. 5
it looks nicer than pictured, seems solid and well-constructed, but most important of all it sounds fantastic! i've only had this amp now for roughly a day, but stayed up a good part of last night playing. i couldn't stop. this morning i opened the outside doors and cranked it all the way up to about half volume. (scared the cat and made the dog wonder what the heck that new thing is making all the noise.) beyond the halfway setting, it would've hurt my ears. yes, it's that loud! absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and small-event purposes. so far, i've only played through the amber pre-sets and only experimented some with the modulations knob. i like the bluesy, tube-effect modelings the most and don't know that i'll see much need to go looking to create a lot of custom settings. but it's nice to know this amp can deliver, either with or without the additional fuse software, such an incredibly diverse array of sounds should the need ever arise. thanks, fender! 5
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning.  it has many features i have yet to utilize, but good to know they are there if needed. 5
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board. the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you. however, i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible. my complaint, like other reviews i read, is that the end doesn't seem to fit snug on some connections. for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals, dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal. the boss pedals however, were hit or miss. can't say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss, but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals. i have a couple ehx pedals also, one side is snug the other loose. anyway, for the money, i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable, nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable. 4
i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input. the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier. with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp. they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. i am returning it. 2
if you're a metalhead, stay away!! i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g10 blows it out of the water. this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion. it's great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch. but if you demand metal, get far away! 1
the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer.  the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it.  i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display.  i'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use.  it is cheap though.  still to me it was money out the window. 2
the tuner i choose is very easy to use, simple and small. good for people who don't have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument. i recomend it. 4
there are so many reviews of this little jewel, i won't bother going into details but it's everything i could have hoped for and more. the sound quality is amazing and it's very easy to use. i'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck. i take it everywhere and it has never let me down. i had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that are included, i have no complaints. 5
will this replace a pro fret job? nah...that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.end results[...] 5
i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano (i have a pro model with xlr outs) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces.  works every time.  balanced signal is so much better...no more issues with ground loops or other problems.  just clear as a bell.they were cheap and the build quality is fine. 5
great strings, the strings on my epiphone les paul wore out so i bought these, my ukulele sounds better than when i first bought it. kinda wish they came in black, the white contrasts with the color of my uke. 5
its a nice pice,, easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar,,, the only matter and its not a big deal,, is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect 4
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them.  nice and stable, easy to change strings and lock tightly.  always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing. to note these have the two peg placement anchors on them, so if your headstock only has the single hole for the tuning peg, you will have to do some drilling. really nice upgrade for your standard tuners. 5
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb. still a great guitar string. a real winner for elixir who are the originators of &#34;goretex&#34; a real triumph of re-invention. well done goretex! 5
the main reason i bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics, is because i had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings, and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop a that is a must. i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree. i've used other tuners when i happened to not bring this one along and  thats been my experience. also its easy to read which note you're on when you're on a dimly lit stage. 5
it's a stand, it does what it's supposed too?  that being said, i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable.  i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only.  these are by far some of the better made ones i've found without a contraption to &#34;lock in&#34; my instrument and give a false sense of security.  these are made no where near how they used to be 20 years ago, in a negative way, but the foam/ medical piping has gotten better as the old stuff used to scuff and deteriorate really quickly.  i'd prefer a better stand, however, i question it's existence. 3
tc is very overrated.many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion.  the vintage bbds (mxr vintage delay, morley 70's echo) for example just take it.  but for newer pedals i liked the mxr carbon copy and ibanex de 7 much better. 2
small... very small and sits right behind the headstock and very easy to see and read. it is very accurate.  what else can i say except that this is a really great idea and it works!!! 5
if you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my ipad left me with choosing between the iriffport and the jam.  i recently purchased, and then returned, the iriffport.  i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement.  here are the reasons why:1) the connector on the iriffport (the one that goes into the ipad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time.  i have a stand to put my ipad on when jamming such that the ipad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way.  with the apogee jam, the connector is just like the ipad's connector, except it also has the "prongs" that come out of it, securing the connector into the ipad.  to remove the connector from the ipad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the "prongs" go in so it can be removed...very, very secure.  i use the "gumdrop" case on my ipad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used.  this flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used.  important:  if you have such an ipad case, like me, i certainly feel that the jam will provide a much more secure connection to your ipad over the iriffport.  in fact, the structure of the iriffport connector was so large, that i felt that it did not fit well through my case.  on the other hand, the jam's connector is the same small size as the ipad's original connector.  this is also something to consider if you intend to use your ipad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the ipad.2) probably the largest reason i prefer the jam over the iriffport:  you can hear sound directly from the ipad.  with the iriffport, you must use headphones or attach external speakers.  i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward.  nonetheless, with the jam, i could attach headphones or external speakers to the ipad if i chose to do so.  i wanted something that could make my ipad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers.  with the jam, i have this.3) the jam has a gain meter (i.e., an led) and a gain control.  the iriffport does not.  when not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the led lets you know if you are connected to the ipad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the ipad and to a software application (green light).  there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport.4) i personally like that i can use my own guitar cord with the jam.  if the cord breaks, i simply replace the cord, not my ipad connection device.  the iriffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my "normal" guitar cable i used with the jam.5)  although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the jam is advertised by apple (look at their website and their garageband video).  and, since i have garageband on my ipad, i was pleased to see that the advertising material on the jam states specifically that it works with garageband.so far, i'm very pleased with the jam. 5
i like the picks a lot! they are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! recommended 5
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time 5
i like the way the snark attaches to all of my guitars and a mandolin. it reacts quickly and is not over-sensitive. the way the mounting and dial articulate make it easy to set up while not interfering with the tuning knobs. easy to read and for the very low price a great value. however, and this may be my own fault, i often need to snap my finger against the dial to get it to start reading. i say my own fault because i put the battery in wrong the first time and had to pull it out with needlenose pliers. that may have damaged a contact. i play with a number of other people that have snarks and they all work properly. i would buy another one without hesitation. 4
i brought for someone else. but they said they love it. so i am a happy camper i did it right. 5
excellent sound quality.very functional and easy to work with.small enough to take along.it is my most used gear in my life right now. i don't want anything else. 5
i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price. i previously had thelucero lc100 classical guitar black (black)which i was completely happy with as a beginner. when it got damaged beyond repair, i looked into thecordoba dolce 7/8 size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i didn't really like the size, so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c5.it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range. the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c5 has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar. while it isn't it the prettiest guitar out there, it's by no means ugly. even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar.the smell of this guitar is also amazing. it doesn't have the cheap wood glue smell of other low-end guitars, but a nice rich smell of wood. even after a few months, kept in a humicase, the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present.all praise aside, it is not a flawless guitar. my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars, especially those at a lower price range. not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of: being a cedar guitar, the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar.i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package. it is a high-quality gig bag with lots of padding. inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place. it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books. when i ordered this guitar from amazon, the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box. i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely.overall, i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered, it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years. highly recommended! 5
great for linking close-quarter effect pedals. no noise and very durable. great product for the price. i would recommend buying. 5
i really like this foot controller because you don't have to reach to the amp all the time to change channels. i wish i had the big usb cable but i can't find it in walmart. this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but it's gone now. anyway, this thing is nice if you're too lazy to reach to the  amp to change channels. i think the product should have been around $70-80. 4
i have tried several rosins for my violin.  of all of them, i especially like l'opera jade.  it leaves very little rosin dust on the violin.  yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for. 5
i've used gls products before and they are good quality for a fair price. their microphones do a great job for little cost. i've been impressed. these cables didn't disappoint me, either. don't judge their products on price alone. try them first. you will be pleased and your bank account will thank you. 5
from the other reviews i wasn't sure what to expect but this is a nice stand for the money. i use it and my granddaughter uses it as well. it is sturdy, easy to fold away and easy to setup. the leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary. i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand. 4
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves!!! the heavy bottons 32, 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone. the others, 10, 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also. i don't rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci. when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection. the high strings were plenty of flakes. if fender solved that it would be perfect. 4
wow, this works!  at first, i was a little wary about using the liquidthe original peg drops by ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product.  being my own bumbling teacher, there was a fear i could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument.  however, i needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs, so i closed my eyes and blundered ahead (that's just a figure of speech; for i was careful, using the stuff for the first time).  with care, cotton and a small rag (torn off my moth eaten underwear) i went ahead, willing to try anything.  i even removed the strings from the pegs (only one at a time - starting with the inner one first), put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string.  tuning then became a breeze.  to think i used up a great glob of practice time, not fiddling, but tuning.  bop! could'a had a veggie drink! 5
it works well and gets the job done but the battery dies way to quickly, other than that its has a cool clip that lets it be placed anywhere 3
received a new 500w hartke 2x10 bass combo at church, tube pre and ss power amp. the preamplifier has one 12ax7. it was an eh. it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time. after talking to larry hartke, decided i got a bad tube. he would not send a warranty replacement. my suggestion - new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation. replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like doug's tubes, tube depot, eurotubes, or some other reputable tube vendor. i don' t trust ebay tubes and won't spend the hard earned cash on nos. replaced with a jj, but should have used a tungsol reissue. 3
this cable is perfect! great sound quality and durability. i will not buy any other cable except planet waves! best bang for the buck for any working musician hands down, yes there are cheaper cables ,,but they don't sound as good or last as long, planet waves is the way to go 5
i purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin, she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin. 5
very nice guitar slide. the glass is nice, slides very well on my electric and acoustic, and it fits like a mitten. 5
does what its suppose to..only giving it 4 stars because they should have a multiple preset switch available rather then only letting you do one 4
i love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. i'm hoping they last a while! 5
i haven't used it a lot yet, but i really like it so far.. much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo i was using, and it works for my guitars and my banjo, without putting them out of tune. it seems to be solidly made as well, and not too much pressure as others said.. my old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :p, and was much heavier. i'd assume it was made out of cast-iron or something instead of aluminum. 5
i always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal.  never had such colorful ones though :)  if you need picks do the math.  it pays. ships fast as always. 5
it does what is supposed to, i'ts a gate, and clamps the noise as good as i expected, at the begining i had problems with power, some how it didn't power correctly, but i was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain, so i solved it isolating the mxr connecting it with another power supply, and it work, so i left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine, also check config and the routing of the signal, this might influence on how it works, i have it right after my wha and before my compressor, and it works just fine. 4
actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great. had issues before with company but they resolved all issues. i would do business with them again. thanks for taking care of me. pleasure doing business with you 5
i've owned the same one for 10 years and it's still going strong after many gigs. the spring tension is just right. 5
great all round pick, one of my favorites.  easy to grip and are pretty quite.  they wear out extremely fast though. 5
i didn't know when i ordered these mic stands that they were on stage stands. they are fully adjustable, great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics. excellent quality. i'm very happy with this set. 5
light weight, compact, and all in one tool, what more could i ask for?this tool does three things very well, turns tuners on stringed instruments quickly, cuts musical instrument strings, and helps pull acoustic guitar string pins. what's not to like? well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open - guess i'm used to side cutters or pliers - and it doesn't cut strings really close to the tuning pin - it leaves about a half inch of string hanging. oh, if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar (go to the elixir strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the taylor guitar factory) your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners. the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more.i find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings, somebody could manage to break this plastic tool. the tool is made of sturdy plastic. if abused, trying to cut copper wire, it might break; but the tool was never designed for that use.i've used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time. i use this on three different guitars, an acoustic and two electrics (les paul and prs). the pin puller works just fine, i actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood. the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case. this is a very nice tool. 5
i like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works. why that's overly important in a volume pedal i'm not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging. it takes up a huge footprint on a board so i generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoe/boot on the thing and that is comforting while playing. overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and doesn't suck the tone like other volume pedals. good buy- 5
shipped in time. just what i have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. easy to screw it on the wall. 5
after years of playing, i rather choose this small and strong accessory to take care of my precious guitars and basses. 5
the acoustic guitar quick release system is very interesting.  i ordered this as a filler item for a much larger order, just to give it a try.  so far so good.  thanks. 5
a very boring, dull, uninspiring pedal. don't waste your time with this. a boss sd-1 or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range. 2
i take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile, but it always finds its way back in.  unlike kaga, i put it at the end of my chain, right before a boss line selector, for multiple amps.  i used to put it at the beginning of my chaing, during my metal days, and it does well there too.  i'm more blues orientated now, and love it at the end.  with my fuzzes i can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth, then at the end with the eq, i got it jacked up!  unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq.  i love that bass, but i play through 10's and 15's and those speakers handle it better than 12's, although i do have a 2x12 with v30's in it and it sounds nice.  this is a must have pedal though, no matter what you want your sound to end up like, if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone, you got it with this thing. 5
i use this to run a single, mono xlr shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my tascam dr-40, which saves me a step in post-production.  the quality is fine and it does what it's supposed to do.  good price for a good product. 5
for $99 you get the best good sized, heavy duty, high quality amp with tons of sound!-construction: solid, good material and parts, fender used the good stuff.-sound: nice clear & loud sound especially for an 8" speaker and 20w amp. you can definitely jam with a drummer no problem, or just shred it wearing headphones.-effects: there are 9 "amp models" (i.e. "57 deluxe", "metal 2000", etc...) and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from, you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp models.the effects include chorus, deep chorus, flange, tremelo, vibration, phaser, step filter, delay (150ms, 300ms, 700ms), reverb, large hall, small room, echo filter, octaver, etc...)so what are the presets? each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds).when you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the "gain" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set. same with treble, bass, volume, and all other effects. the moment you touch any dials or effects knobs, you have custom control to tweak each preset, just temporarily, or save it if you wish.it's so great, because often i feel i would have made a present slightly more this or that, simply grab the gain or change the treble, or move from delay to reverb and make it your own! very easy.-ease of use: plug in your guitar, spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects. plug in ipod or computer with 3.5mm male cable. it's that easy!-pc software: i've heard their is trouble installing, mine said "error" and did not install on windows 7. i know there are ways to fix this, and i will do so when i have some time. comes with a usb cable (mini for the amp, regular plug for the computer). works for mac or pc, get more presets, use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer. play on guitar rig and amplitude. awesome.-size: perfect. big enough to give it a serious look, and a quality feel. small enough to fit easily under a table, next to your desk, etc. looks like 18"x18" to me. the front metal-looking grill is mesh, but quality and looks great.-tuner: super simple. doesn't tell you which note is in tune, just tells you left, right, or green in center for "in tune".all in all when compared to the line 6 spider, and many other fender amps, this one has the quality sound, the dozens of different effect combinations, input for a footswitch, aux for ipod, and usb for computer. it has it all. i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it. the reverb and gain distortion are so clean, and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone. my guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp.don't sleep on this, it's $99 for a loud quality amp with $1,000s worth of effects peddles built in.and did i mention, easily customizable so easy i could teach a 5 year old. select a preset, change the dials you want to change, make changes permanent only by hitting "save" otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them.love this amp, and i've shopped every comparable model. this is the one, hands down worth a minimum of $150.louder than my friends 60w!:d one love fender mustang you rock! 5
i bought the hell babe 10 years ago, it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since, the same one. i have never had a major problem with it, the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal. its no crybaby and im glad, it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn't no matter how much i tweaked it. i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more, especially since it has the auto off and spring back. it really makes my solos rip. buy it, you will have a ball. my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever..... 4
i bought this one for one of my heavier guitars hoping for some shoulder relief and it does the job.  it's inexpensive and the padding is excellent.  it looks like it will last too. 5
stringed instruments are best hung vertically, which this stand accomplishes beautifully.  constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment. 5
this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar. it gets the job done easily and very fast. 5
let me start of by saying this tuner is great.my previous tuner was a korg ca-40 and frankly, that tuner is terrible.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40:sat800 has a build-in light, ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode, ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1e, 2e, etc, ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet, e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off, ca-40 does not.what made me get a new tuner is how finicky the ca-40 when using the build-in mic. the needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner. yes, it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability. another issue with the ca-40 is the poor screen. the screen is so dark and only viewable head on.the ca-40 does not have any of the flaws of the ca-40 and is even more accurate.what this tuner has: accuracy, usability, durability, versatility. what more can you ask from a tuner of this price? 5
i read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie-device. working just fine so far, came quickly in the mail. 5
this is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good.  i broke the high e on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily i had bought 2 packs at the same time.  so, i want to keep a completed pack for back up.  i have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  i have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter. 4
i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq. i did have to sand to make it fit. that may sound badm but i am glad because it's better than too small. i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering. 5
when you are upgrading your fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold fender jack plate. 5
these are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard. i expect them to last for a long time 5
manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar. i have an esp eclipse. not even close. chromacast products are great. they need to fix the info on their web page. i'm not a fan of shaped les paul cases. too bad. 1
i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones.they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones.but the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music i say go for dr.dre beats.if you want to know what the noise isolation feels like , just putting your hands on your ear. 4
a booster makes your signal louder!  that has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like mxr micro amp, ehx lpb-1, bbe boosta grande, modtone, etc.  they keep your guitar's original tone, make it louder and when pushed enough, will add a good amount of gain & grit.  but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster.  yes, it also makes the signal louder, adds gain or a little dirt, but also makes your overall sound bigger & wider!  based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like jimmy page, duane allman, gary moore, etc.  this pedal is really small in size, has one knob & the footswitch.  it does have an internal dip switch.  you open up the back of the pedal & choose you own setting.  i leave at the classic setting, turn the gain knob at 9 or 10 o'clock & leave it on all the time.  i tried it before & after my od pedals and my personal preference is "after"!  being in front of the amp, it didn't do much when i tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp.  i put it in the fx loop & it boosted the signal alright but i didn't like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my od pedals.this is one pedal that will stay on my board.  i doesn't take up much space, built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better.  it does one job only but it does it so well! 5
it's a very cute little capo. it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small. but it works. 5
i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap. plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play. if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made. 2
personally, i love the nanoweb strings.  i have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  as i'm no pro, i don't want to put strings on them that i'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.i don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit "different" than other strings.  they're exactly what i want - a string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings. 4
for the money, i have no complaints.  the enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable.  not true bypass, but none of the boss pedals are.  it doesn't suck tone.  this pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don't. you lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with el84s.  as a stand alone overdrive, i prefer other pedals.  but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  you get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  lately, i am running this into either the v1 cool cat transparent overdrive (timmy clone - very, very nice) or the behringer bo-100 (which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (jet city combo or palomino combo).  as with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (imho) running into a solid state amp.  that's just not what it was intended to do. it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv. because i'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) i bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price. 4
after you use these the large, flimsy old school picks will be used just when you don't have one of these babies available.  these are the best picks out there.  if you don't have these already you better purchase them now.  black or red, the color is the only difference. 5
they're round and they fit over microphones.  work well to stop pops and lisps.  have been very happy with them. 5
there really does not need to be a 10 page review that breaks this thing down to every tedious detail. this is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar, and tunes it in perfect pitch. for a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat. these are a staple on every single guitar in our band! bright and easy to read! 5
it is strange how few fingerboard lubrication products there are that work well and don't build up, stink, or cost too much.i use this on all my household's guitars and basses. works excellently, application from this bottle is good though occasionally needs a stir and shake to get more lubricant on the applicator. 5
it is very easy to apply, great results and very little effort. i'm surprised by the results. never got this shine in my guitar with any other product. 5
the small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  i haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.luckily i bought the three pack.but i can't recommend this product. 1
definitely the best looper i've come across. lots of looping time; simple to use; unlimited overdubs.really can't go wrong with the ditto! 5
i had never owned an electronic tuner before, but have used the large models and the iphone apps.  this is a great product.  it is easy to use.  adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument.  i haven't banged it around, but have had no problems with durability.  bright, easy to read display.  i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike. 5
these cables are very good quality. i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage. they are good quality, and very durable. 5
this guitar strap is very  comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric yamaha guitar.very durable and affordable.my only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would.colors are abit too flashy. 4
people complain that these aren't really rolling string trees, despite the fact that the description *never* says or even implies they are, in fact, "rolling" string trees.  honestly, they don't need to be, at least for most guitars.  these small, round guides are superior to the flat, wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings.  less contact means less friction, less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.i put them on a cheap telecaster copy i have and noticed the results immediately, and i did not replace either the tuners or the nut, those are still the cheap stock parts.if you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot, rollers might be a little better, but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them, all you need is a screwdriver), it was a no brainer for my telecaster. 5
capos are not something that i shop for. i have had two for years. one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type. it is similar to this one. yeah...in looks only. this one blows that one away. it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner. it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways. this is great. i play a tele and an acoustic martin. it works great on both. i play professionaly and this is the best thing i've gotten in two years. 5
quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. thank you very much 5
i am impressed at the thought that was put into the design of this product; i bought one for my daughter and one for me; great deal for a great product! 5
highest quality guitar i've ever seen in this price range. it looks, feels, and sounds amazing!! a+ i bought two 5
this is a good micro-fiber cloth, but i guess because its from ernie ball it costs more than other clothes.  but if you are like me, its all about my axes, i have one in each gig bag/case!  i don't recommend using with polish, just a wipe down after each guitar or bass use. 4
this tuner is cool. it picks up even the lightest vibrations, i/e: i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out. i also like the capo tuning feature. you put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x. i highly recommend this tuner. 5
ok, so they are just screws....... but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one!!!  and it is fender licensed! 5
another great roland product.  really easy to use and well built .... very good sound.  great for practice.  certainly do not get the rc 2  ... get this rc 3 model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later...i did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big... check for sales or demos 4
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar. it sounds good and looks really nice. i get compliments on it. 5
i was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive. i don't hold it against the pedal though. i have a marshall class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive i get from the amp, i say this as a compliment. in my case, however, why would i want to replicate what i already have? i'm gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp. you should check out the 78 badasss distortion from mxr too. 4
nice to use to muse your violin. a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing. great buy. 4
i got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me.  the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet.  construction features too well soldered trs 1/4&#34; male connections and the only downside i can complain about is the lack of strain relief...but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less. 5
i have a lot of high end instruments, and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.this stuff is fantastic - much better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. an hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. i apply it on occasion with the strings on (i use elixirs) and have never once had a problem.the best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 stars. 5
it is a fun little practice amp, and i agree with the praise it gets. the positives have been covered so i'll point out a few (minor) things i don't like.first of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. the rest of the controls are on top, why do i have to grope around the back to find the most important button. plus i keep it in a cabinet so i have to pull it out to turn it on and off.next! i wish they'd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34;, &#34;overdrive&#34;, &#34;distortion&#34;, and so on. jc clean, black panel, brit combo and r-fier mean nothing to me.then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. a 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. not heavy like i can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.none of these are deal breakers, just things i find annoying. overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3. 4
i can't believe these were actually sent to me. the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china. i am sending them back. there is no way i would use these. any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 1
i use these on all my guitars.  love them.  easy to assemble and use.  if you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  once installed they are fantastic. 5
i got this little guy for my spider iv 15 for all the awesome features and it works flawlessly. channel switching is a breeze, with almost no delay. the tuner works great as well, i tuned it on there then with my korg tuner and it matches up. the wah volume pedal is very useful too, vol is good for fade ins or fade outs. the amount of force needed to switch to wah is quite a bit, and seems like its a little too much force that's needed, but it works. and once you're switched over to the wah, don't expect to match up with voodo chile or bulls on parade. its good, but doesn't really cut it if you want a great wah sound. overall though it's a good buy for your line 6 amp. 5
i got this and it works well apart from the fact you have to really bang down on the keys, im hoping over time they will be easier to press 4
this liitle box works great for my needs. i am using three guitars on stage (when possible/room permitting.)and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp. this way i can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such. it also solves a second problem: since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs (fender single coils, ibanez acoustic with fishman piezo and les paul gibson humbuckers), i now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match. this is perfect for that. inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that i velcro to my small pedal board..i'm glad someone else mentioned the a/c plug on theirs being european standard and not 110 volt us standard. don't be surprised if it happens to you. i bought one and had the same experience. i got mine from musicians friend. they offered to have me return it but i chose to keep it since i had a 12 volt power supply available from an older unit i long since stopped using. no stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn't check their inventory to make sure it was us standard. 5
i've been recording on my imac, ipod touch, ipad, and iphone for some time, using garage band. interfacing with the imac is easy, using various usb devices- i'm currently using a usb-equipped alesis preamp. ios device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use usb preamps, with an externally powered usb hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy.  i've been using simple devices like the 1k that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar. the problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good. the apogee jam is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons. first, it contains its own dedicated preamp and a/d, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity. interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the ipad and iphone it was immediately recognized. i didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables.the jam is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole i think it's worth it. it's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality. it does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iphone. you'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions. with the ipad, this isn't as noticeable. even with that issue, i think the jam is a good value.  the various ios devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input. given the cost of an new iphone or ipad, the cost of the jam is rather trivial in comparison. 5
this is a great-sounding reverb pedal. tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. i've combined this with a epiphone sheraton ii (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep, rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). the design is very solid, and the controls are quite easy to use. honestly, i think it has a lot of reverb settings that i won't use very much, but there's no problem with them being there.i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon, u2, etc. or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones, this is it. this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. my only caveat to this review is that i haven't tried out other reverb pedals, but this one definitely suits all my needs. 5
its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back 3
it works and cleans the strings, but its durability is a little low, for about 2 months. i recommend planet waves string cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner. 3
not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do.  limited dynamic range.  but, it works.  wish i'd have gotten something a little nicer though. 2
i got this several years ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by it, really was nice with my acoustic to raise some volume on my soundhole pickup before the direct box. i gave it to some one after i used it for a couple of years. 4
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light.my first one arrived not working at all.the second one arrived with a low battery. what? after three days the battery goes out.i would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. you've been warned. 1
the product feels a little on the "cheap" side, but definitely does the job the way it should- so that's all i care about. it was cheap, and came fast. i recommend it. 4
this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig.  it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box.  it lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when i need to use my table for something besides podcasting.the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built.  there's nothing bad i can say about it, if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up.  highly recommended. 5
these cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp.  not too long, not too short.  just what i needed. 5
the string are easy to play and sound great. there is a reason they are used by so many professionals. 5
i've been playing for over 30 years and now have three different electronic tuners, so i'm a good judge of the snark:pros:  it's chromatic so it's good for every tuning job; no need to plug it into your jack; ambient noise doesn't affect it; great sharp, colorful display; reacts quickly; small enough to fit easily in my case; cool blue color; built-in metronome; powers down automatically to save the battery; transposes up to four steps if you're using a capo; will even identify major chords.cons:  works better on acoustics and semi-hollows than on solid bodied guitars; made me realize that three of my strings need intonating (or is that a pro?); metronome is visual only; manual says that long-term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars' finishes; big blue thing on your guitar looks weird.now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners.  this is easier to use, easier to carry around, you don't have to unplug from your amp, it works on acoustic or electric, and it's chromatic.  and it's cheap.  definitely recommended. 5
finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in 1976 finally died. a great pedal, well made! 5
these are good cables at a good price!! not sure they would hold up to heavy use, but for practicing at home they are really great! 5
i got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. that is a record. the tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. it is the sound that i like though. 5
take some time but it was well worth it.  i've always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards.  this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before! 5
great picks, buy it. this pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing. 5
others that reviewed this item i read before purchase, noted it is not &#34;large&#34; and the picks have to be warmed and shaped to fit your thumb. i also found in original &#34;large&#34; size, the curve of the pick will cut into your thumb from improper shaping and being too small for the average american man. i am still in the process of shaping all 5, but otherwise they appear sturdy and i haven't broken more than one of similar type in several years. i expect the pick to wear down from use. they appear to be about the same quality as indigo brand, but not shaped as well for the average player. 3
great price. i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board. very flexable and pretty good quality 4
please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. they don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. it only took me about half an hour. it clearly states starter pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. these people just do not know how to read. it has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. if you want real protection, i would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. i highly recommend this product. 5
playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings, i've preferred just to strum using my fingers because "traditional" plastic picks are just too harsh and loud.  even felt picks are too harsh (not to mention the dust/shedding they do).the wedgie is exactly what i've been looking for. harder than my thumb, softer than plastic or felt, the 3.1mm hard rubber wedgie is the goldilocks pick; right in the butter zone.i tried the "soft" and "medium" wedgies, but both were just too soft.  the soft wedgie over-grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone.  the medium is better, but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft.but the hard wedgie is the clear winner.  i get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings.the only negatives i've found are:1. they can leave skid marks on your pick guard.  no big deal, as it wipes right off.2. they break down faster than i'd like.  of course, that could just be my expectations.still, if you're looking a softer-than-plastic pick, this is the one to get. no pick noise, just strings. i couldn't be happier. 5
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals.  i've knocked this microphone around a decent amount, and it is plenty rugged.  i couldn't be happier with it. 5
this behringer compressor sustainer compare's to the boss cs-2 the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone, compression level is very good and all for $25.00 , not putting down the boss, but for this price you can't go wrong. 5
i like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. the red color is a metallic color - and i totally dig it. the display is nice and bright as well. super accurate tuning. well worth it for the price. 5
these cables are really the best. they sound perfectly, they look and feel strong, their contact is perfect. life time warrany. recommended. 5
i got this to use on an old mac computer to allow me to use some equipment that needed more than a line level output. it works great for that. haven't used it for anything else, though, so cant comment there. seems sturdy and well made as well. 5
awesome cord hope they make more and the world will be a better place, peace and love to you all !!!!!!! 5
i needed a single button switch for my little mustang i that i practice on. i've never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is. it will do the job but it's lightweight and won't sit flat on the floor if the cord isn't laying exactly right. i searched a little further and ran across this switch on amazon by scrolling down a bit. "marshall footswitch, one button with led by amplifiedparts." folks, this thing is built like a tank. the casing is made of heavy duty (i don't know what gauge) solid steel. there's nothing rinky dink about it. i plugged it in to the ftsw jack, clicked the button, the led lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset. again, light went out and back to the original. it felt solid under my foot and i don't think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb. sledge hammer. i don't know how well the electronics will hold up (i just got it today) but the switch, again, feels solid like it's supposed to. it cost me $20.90 with shipping. it takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we're use to with amazon but it ships directly from amplifiedparts, i believe. i'm a fender fan but this beats their single switch. thanks for reading guys. lane h. 5
apple threw a curve at me when, with the new "thin" imac, the company eliminated not only the superdrive but the 3.5mm "audio in" port that had been highly useful on previous models, especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord.  after trying a griffin and logitech device, i finally found a useful workaround with the behringer ufo202 interface (there are 2 other very similar models by behringer--the uca202 and the uca222). what sets these interfaces apart from the 302usb is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, "dedicated" usb cord.  simply by plugging the usb cord into the usb port on my imac i was able to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and lps just as i had done with my old imac (though monitoring required more cords in back--ugh!).for a committed neophyte like me, the ufo202 was probably sufficient.  i miss the permanently attached usb "out" cable and, moreover, am questioning whether i'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302usb, which to my eyes has a bit of a "learning curve."  the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual.  instead of separate sections, the manual uses small, thin font and mixes english with spanish instructions--a minor but unnecessary inconvenience. (but give behringer credit for providing a manual!)i thought i was investing in more versatility (for a modest price increase) than what the behringer ufo/uca line of interfaces offered me.  but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording sound-on-sound.  my present programs (sound studio and toast) can't do it, but if gb can layer 2 or more sound sources, then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better.  if not, the behringer ufo202 is not only adequate to serve my needs, but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new imac's desk space (apple's elimination of the internal burner gives the company "thin screen" bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner).behringer has presented the best solution i've been able to find to apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest imac.  if your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302usb is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks.  but if you have a ufo or uca interface, your needs may already be covered. 4
i used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar (fender strat). i was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked. the end that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well, you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings. i highly recommend it. 5
great stand, holds my mid sized keyboard up very well.  not sure how it works for some behemoths but for the basic setup its fine. 5
all tuners like this are going to be a little "jumpy", none of them are perfect.  this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it.the korg pitchblack was a little out of my price range, so the ga40 is working perfect for now.  overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand... five stars. 5
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup. always getting the question,&#34;can i hook my keyboard into your sound board&#34;. feel good to say that now i have the capability now 4
great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while. i&#8217;m not sure why a few people are putting these strings down; i&#8217;ve used them numerous times without any issues. they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i&#8217;ve played. 5
i use this pair of mics mostly to record a piano in xy configurationpros:-price point-sturdy, good construction-included accessories (carrying case, clips, stereo bar)cons:-have to adjust the gain just right on a mixer preamp to avoid noise 4
best recorder for the money i've seen...easy to use, easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings...the nearest competitor to this is slightly slimmer, witch to me would not be a plus because i don't use this on a camera rig..the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is...check out the youtube vids on it, i believe it to be more versatile than its competition, and the build quality is higher as well...the only thing the other has on this one is its size.... 5
exceeded my expectations on quality and price.  when i saw the deal on amazon, i thought it would be low quality harmonicas, but they are good quality. 5
i just picked up a pod hd500 and i love it. of course a couple days later they announced the hd500x, but it doesn't look like they've made any major changes. anyway, if you're thinking of getting one, here are my thoughts, in no particular order:*this thing is versatile. you can use it in a number of different ways. just as an effects board with 8 customized effects, with effects and amp sims, as a midi controller, and as a recording interface, to name a few*line 6 gave you access to the guts. everything is tweakable, assignable, and flexible. they trust their users to read the freaking manual. i'm amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs. want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay? no problemo!*for live performance, this thing would be perfect. it allows you to organize your presets in "set lists" and name everything whatever you want. you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves.*while not all the effects are my cup of tea (in particular, some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear) there are enough options to make anyone happy. for example, i love the distortion i get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up.*the built in looper goes forward, backward, half speed, before effects, after effects. fantastic!* it's built like a tank. metal exterior, everything feels solid and like it will last longer than i willif you've got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance, take a look at these and the new 500x version. just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates (not to mention the amps) would cost you more money, assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones. truly a great piece of gear! 5
only  thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place, but  worked great for what i wanted to screw around with it, 5
after reading a bunch of reviews about this product, i was not sure about buying it , but i give it a try and i am completely satisfy, it doesn't ad noise to my pedal chain, i use it with a radioshack power supply 9v 2.5 a , and a can tell that not a sound came from electric issues.i'm not saying that it is better than a voodoo lab power brick , but for me work perfect and i don't see why not taking it out for gigs. 5
yes, it's cheap plastic.  yes, the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours.  yes, the battery is difficult to replace.  however, this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet.  i solved the battery problem by using a 1-spot 8-outlet pedal power supply.  it doesn't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest.  everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here, and it all sounds great.  it even has a "modulated" reverb, which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only (not the dry signal) which is their version of the holy grail's "flerb" setting.  this is about 1/3 the cost of the holy grail, and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use (unless of course, you are an elephant).  for all the complaining i hear about this and other pedals with "cheap plastic cases", i have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it.  behringer pedals are hit and miss, but this one is certainly a hit. 4
* shipping.  the epiphone comes wrapped in  protective foam, inside a gig bag, which is inside a sturdy standard tri-shaped box, which is itself shipped inside a huge box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic.  that huge box is then inside yet another huge box.  honestly, to protect this better they'd have had to contact tony stark.  it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping.  excellent job.  5 stars on that alone.* size. overall length 24".  fretboard 10".  nut to bridge 15".  so good overall medium-size.  i like that it's a bit larger than a 20-21" soprano uke.  it is "concert" size (which i greatly prefer over soprano.  frankly, i'd like to see a baritone version).  the 24" length is an excellent size for both adult and youth / child fingers.* quality.  from stern to port, this instrument shines.  beautifully lacquered flawless finish, protective edging, plastic finger-guard (which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic), solid neck screw-joined to heavy-wood body.  the whole unit is heavy-wood and very durable.  nevertheless the sound is quite good.  the tuners are acceptable quality (nothing amazing, but they work well).  the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes.  the amp-jack is chrome-metal back-plated to the body; it's not coming loose.  strap holders are already mounted, saving users the hassle.  and of course, the impressive epiphone and les paul signature stamps on the head for sheer class.* sound.  i found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box, despite the fact it's pretty solid-wood electric (i expected it to sound dull.  it doesn't.)  but i still bought a set of d'addario strings (a brand i've loved for years) and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added.* action. i've rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception. the action is fairly high (not uncommon with off-the-shelf instruments).  one will need to remove the strings (keep them for emergency spares), file down the bridge bottom (easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper) and add a new set of quality strings.  i'm a perfectionist when it comes to action (as are most players i know), so this will be tweaked.* durability.  it's very durable.  that counts for the gig bag too.  no cheap "tent nylon" there-- but thick nylon that will really resist tearing.  as others mentioned i'd still look for a decent hard case; they average under $40.  a good instrument is worth protecting.  but i'd say this could take some real punishment and still play well-- not that i'd go bashing it against a stage floor.  that would be goofy.* weird suggestion:  hang on to the box it comes in.  it makes a great temporary "hard shell" case. it's made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke.  great for hauling around in your car if you can't shell out for a shell. seriously... that is some stiff cardboard.  protects well.  : )* electronics.  the sound is clear. sadly there is no volume/tone control, no battery to preamp, and thus the signal to the amp was quite low.  they could have done better on that end.  but wow, at this price how can one gripe?two solutions to this:1) open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better (including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible).  that's the tricky way.2) put a preamp on this. you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks. if you have a mini-mixer you can do the same thing with that.  even with that little extra expense you'll come out ahead.aside from the passive electronics... this is a prime instrument.  it is a mid-size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano (if you're careful and don't tune it too quickly) or a baritone (guitar 4th - 1st string, e-high), depending on the strings you choose.considering what you get for the price... i don't think this can be beat.  unfortunately, my extra-long fingers find this very difficult to play... something i didn't consider when ordering a uke.  but that's a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument.  the product itself is excellent. 5
it arrived on time, i have an epiphone hummingbird acoustic guitar, so i needed a pickup for do some recording,it works well but it's not very loud. this thing should sound louder, next time, i'll buy a duncan pickup. 3
this is a great little addition to both my violin, and my mandolin.  while some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele . . . no.  it doesn't work that way, unless the sound hole is not directly over the strings.  if it is, the pickup will mute the a string, and it's annoying.anyway i digress.  the pickup adds a bright, clear sound to your instrument, without feedback or hassle. 5
while the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the ksm32, look elsewhere. 2
anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that i am not fond of the snark displays.  i prefer the "needle" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  however, that's me and ymmv, as they say on the internet.don't ask, then, why i got a sn-6.  i don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and i like to play with accessories.i am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  they all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.well, that's not *quite* true.  some models suffer fits in certain situations.  the rapid fall of the old intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low e string on a martin dreadnought.  a web search will reveal countless workarounds.  i (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.lately, i've become enamored of thekala ka-ubassfs solid mahogany u-bass - fretted.  if you want a tuning challenge, the low bass e string is it.  the sn-6 hardly hiccups.  other tuners seem to do "okay" but require a little coaxing.  not the sn-6! that's 5 stars in my book! 5
dunlop slides are nice and smooth with rounded edges, they sound great, they're indestructable (so far) and they're supremely affordable.  i own a few of them.  i prefer a shorter one most of the time, but i use this one often, as well.sure, you can spend more on a slide, but i see no reason to. 5
whether you're a beginner, or have been playing for a long time, you can never go wrong with ernie ball strings. 5
i love dunlop straps because i'm a tall guy and they're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi. 5
this is an intriguing idea for a microphone: a nice condenser with built-in monitoring.  a possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal.  it seemed to me that i should test it both as a microphone and as a usb io device.  the very first appearance is impressive.  there's a nicely-compartmentalized carrying case.  inside, there's a milled aluminum desk stand, a cable, a short manual and the microphone.  no shock mount. the mic looks good, but has almost no mass.  while this may not mean much, i own and have used lots of mics--none of them this lacking in heft.i set up a shootout in my studio. i have an acoustically-treated room with calibrated studio monitors, so i think i can do a fair test.  i kept it simple, using a steel string guitar played in several styles.  for a comparison mic, i used an akg perception 420.  this is a multipattern mic that's only a little more expensive; a cardiod-only version is exactly the same price as this mxl.  i used only the cardiod pattern, so i think it's a fair comparison on the basis of price.  to get to the point, the akg beat the mxl in every way.  it was quieter, with a much better midrange.  a glance at the specs (online at mxl) shows a significant boost in higher frequencies, leading to about a 3db rise at 8k or so.  the polar pattern is shown only in broadband (not at multiple frequencies) and it shows a dip at the 45-degree position.  these were things i could easily hear.so purely as a microphone, the mxl doesn't match up to other mics in its price range.  but that's not a complete comparison.  the mxl has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency.  that's a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses.  the mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable--better make sure you hold still when you use it.  there's also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level.  this means that it's easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you're mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level.there's also an optional software control panel (mac and windows) that goes with the mic.  it provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring.  i'm unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing; once done, it can't be undone.  i'd apply those after the fact when i've got plenty of time to dial them in.  this leaves the level controls--a place where mxl could have been more careful.  there's a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself.  it takes some doing to figure out which does what.  there's a highpass filter--tremendously useful when rumble is a problem.  but we don't know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain.  i hope it's analog, but there's nothing about it in the documentation.  then there's the biggest problem.  there's a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic's headphone jack.  but this also means that--depending on your daw--it's easy to set up a feedback path.  you won't like that.the biggest question in my mind is "just who is this microphone for"?  a traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate.  i have mics (both expensive and inexpensive) that i've had for years and years.  only the preamp/interface changes.  this mxl is usb-only, 44/48 only.  you can't easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues.  most usb/firewire mic preamps have a zero-latency monitoring mode, so the mic doesn't really offer anything you can't get elsewhere.  in the end, i don't really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians.  to me, that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer.  if you're a podcaster or a serious skyper, then this mic deserves consideration.  it's a decent mic for spoken voice--the hf boost is helpful in bringing out articulation--and the single usb connection keeps your desk uncluttered.  of course, there are plenty of other choices for that application.  but i think that's the best light to shine on this one. 3
this mixer has four mic inputs. it has some fun effects. this mixer comes with a 80hz filter and a 3-band equalizer on the mic channels. it has a fx-send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono. i do not hear any external noise. it has a durable metalic case.  this mixer has great audio. 5
simple, no frills, stand.  only problem i've had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off.  a lil' glue will fix it, just haven't had time! 5
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic. the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone. i might try a lighter set next time, but these have a good clear tone from low to high, and are fairly comfortable. 4
i got this for my epi sheraton ii:pros:  it fits perfectly; it's "fur" lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five), but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over, two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side, and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.cons:  it's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some "made in china" characteristics.i've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  on a personal level, i'd prefer it didn't say "epiphone" on the outside.  but since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 gibson 335. 5
i've been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy. this was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine. no regrets on the buy at all. 5
it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. the bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. this one? meh. not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo. 2
most guitar shapes and sizes fit on this guitar stand,it is easy to assemble and theres really not much to it but the fact that its a guitar stand,nothing special about it. 5
i purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar, this fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my jackson dk2 ,  i'm using 3 springs right know and stay's in tune no matter the abuse.the only con on this product is that they are noisy, is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing. 4
this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit "hive mind" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory. 2
it works great for five of my lower power pedal type items, including my line 6 wireless receivers, shure wireless receivers, and several other pedals like my cry baby, etc., all at once.  however, the transmitter for my shure wireless in-ear monitor, which requires less power than any of the other two items combined, will not run, even by itself, when powered by the 1 spot.  switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own, and there is probably some little quirk in the shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with.  for most of my stuff it works great, and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords. 4
these picks seem well made and have a solid feel, but i'm not sure i like the sound of them.  like so many other guitarists, i go through a lot of picks, searching for what feels and sounds the best for what i do.  i don't this is it for me--at least not on acoustic.  whatever i didn't like about them got drowned out when i tried electric.  since i've been playing more acoustic lately, i might or might not buy these again. 4
ive been trying different strings for years!!!  ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change.  these are very bright and clean!!!!  very playable!!! 5
i was looking for a financially good deal. the price was so reasonable, i said, "how can something this cheap be that good",..well they were a great investment. i use them all the time and have had people ask me where i purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone. when i told them the price, they thought i was pulling there leg,..i wasn't. the case is plastic, foam and clips. three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself. i'd buy these again in a heart beat. i just might buy another 3-pack!! 4
excellent product at a righteous price. helps my guitar stay in tune.changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better. 5
does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating 5
i got what i ordered.  however, if i had paid more attention, this is nothing but a standard power supply which i could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the tascam name on it.update 5-03-2012 after receiving comments and reading other reviews:i've gotten a comment and have read many comments and i don't know where the fault lies, but this power supply is not the power supply for the new replacement tascam dr-07mkii.  the power supply for that unit is the ps-p515uif you are unsure what power supply for which model tascam recorder you have, go to tascam's website and research it before buying it.the tascam psp520 ac adapter/power supply for mpgt1 is for and does work with the older tascam dr-07 recorder.  i have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered pa head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent. 5
this amp is a quality item for the dollar range (i paid $49.99).  there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality.  we purchased two of these, and one arrived with some minor issues, constant humming regardless of volume or eq settings.  amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem.this is not a 6000w stage amp, nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors...it has a full punch output at full gain/volume, and can easily light up a back yard.specs-input: 1/4" mono (not a tip and ring jack)controls: volume/gain and selectable volume 3-eq range knobs.  there are two volume controls, once for each side of the push button selector.outputs: 1/4" mono (for monitor or mixer), 1/4" dual mono headphone jack (tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel).power:  lighted front panel rocker switchthe box is very slim and small, about a foot by a foot and 8" deep, the rear is partially open, speaker exposed, and allows for cord storage.pros--portability, easy of use and set up.-quality finish (leatherette with steel corners) and good construction, 6" heavy duty lead guitar speaker-excellent sound and electronics for any amp under $100.  there are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are $30-$50 more.  go with this one.cons--units run hot and cold as to quality, but if it works out of the box, it's good, if not, you'll know it as soon as you power it up. buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldn't have any worries.these amps power two squier(tm) by fender electric guitarssquier by fender bullet strat with tremolo bundle with strings, pick card, and polishing cloth - black, rosewood fretboardand do a great job.other accessories for the beginner electric to consider:cords -hosa gtr210 guitar cable 10 ft,planet waves classic series instrument cable, 10 feetstrap -planet waves polypropylene guitar strap, blackstraplocks -dunlop dual design straplok system, nickelhanger -string swing hardwood home & studio guitar hanger (shades may vary) 4
spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth.  shines nice and doesn't leave it feeling oily/sticky.  smells nice and makes your guitar looking new! 5
this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable. 5
good cable and has m et all of our needs.  as all of know who use cables, only time will tell whether they will last. 4
very nice tone, very nice metal sound, very crunchy and deep. well worth it for the price, on par with other way more expensive pedals. definetly buy the power supply with it though, it just makes it better and easier to use. very nice product overall 5
i bought my son a thousand dollar epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago, so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for christmas, i told him an expensive one was not in our budget.we went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one. the sound was absolutely fabulous, much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one.the store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well. in my opinion, this was as good as other brands costing three times as much. i'm not sure how takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money, but if you're looking for a starter guitar, or just looking to add another guitar to your collection, this would make an excellent choice.i inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar, but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price.we also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs. thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar, natural. 5
the description says the color is gold.  it's not.  more of a greenish yellow, but does what it is intended for.  i think i would stick with the black color though. 3
i am very pleased with the quality of this stand. it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less. it shipped on time and the packing was good. 5
i've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. i recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings.the different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one. i was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well. the string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. so handy! 5
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier. better looks and function. tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides. 5
this orange micro crush amp lives up to it's name. it's little bitty, about a third the size of the roland micro cube, but it's plenty loud. surprisingly loud really, it's amazing that much sound comes out of that thing. of course it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the micro cube, it's basically got a clean channel, an overdrive channel and a tuner. then a volume knob a tone knob and that's it. the over drive gives a good sound but i like to run pedals through it anyway. it's missing reverb, which i would like to have, but it's far from a deal breaker.i have no issues with the build quality, it feels solid as a rock. of course it's size and trademark orange color make it look like a toy, it's definitely a capable little amp. definitely a keeper! 5
the threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin, but it's still a great strap and holds up solidly. would certainly buy again. 4
this is purely an overdrive pedal, not a distortion pedal.  it increases the gain and dirties your tone, but it does not actually distort your sound.if you're a metal or hard rock player, don't buy this.  it's better suited for country, soul, r&b;, blues, or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when they're doing a solo.  for that it's excellent, especially considering its very low price.and despite its very low price, it's very solidly built.  it's like a brick.this update is to point out that i've only used the bad monkey pedal with tube amps: a fender blues deville 4x10 and a line 6 spider valve hd100 mk ii running into an ampeg 4x12.  i have no idea how it'll sound with a solid state amp.  but it sounds great with a tube amp.this update is to point out that i finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good.  i recently bought a 100 watt fender mustang iii combo to use as a practice amp.  it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville 410/fender mustang floorboard combination.  as i've said, i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing.  whether i'm playing clean or dirty, the bad monkey gives my guitar a rich/deep/great sounding boost.this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is.  i rarely play directly through any of my amps, e.g., fender hot rod deluxe, blues deville, super champ x2 or ampeg b25, i'll turn down the gain on the bad monkey and use it for a much fatter "clean" sound.  it's just so thick, like texas chili with lots of umph.  you've got to get this pedal. 5
excellent for a serious youngster learning to play, priced right.  the thirteen-year-old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well. 5
say it all, but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece.  a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire. 5
great product, with a little soldering knowledge (really basic in fact), you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all. nice and snug with my american stage cables (d'addario is great! hey, r. ford uses them).  great price too, much less than what my local music shop asks for these. 5
pretty simple tool, did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price. i'd order again if i needed another one! 4
it ok, its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle, the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface....11u rack, not 12u.... 4
the surprise here is how they traded a little bit of diameter (the fatso part) for incredible flexibility (the other f-part).  looks great, no noticeable noise or signal loss.  a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords! 5
this little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size. the locking knobs do their job without fail and i don't have to over crank them to get them to hold. i use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer, recording interface and all the other stuff i use for recording. it adjust perfect for vocals and i drop it down if i want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup. same with my violins. i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup.the base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way. you must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction, it will stand securely in any direction. i set it where i want it then just swing it out of the way till i need it. i have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics. it's just more accessible on the desk. this would work fine for drummers.i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies. thanks 5
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 2
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  some say that the grip is good.  here's my take -- for what it's worth.  i've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  round and flat wound strings.  my general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  it's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  also note, i play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  so the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  i do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  i've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what i've found so far.  i find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars i'm currently playing.  the process of finding the "right" pick is never ending and changes over time.  give these a try and let me know what you think. 4
these really are direct replacements for the prs se line. only the machine heads are somewhat smaller. a great product. 5
each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply.  want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one.  no noise or hum.  has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back.  most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker.  mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs - those go to my marantz pmd 580 digital recorder w/ 32 gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters.  speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces.  there is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such.you'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain.  you can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 db0 range.  it may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately.you could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 db and turn it way down on the speakers.  i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 db0 off the mixer.having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation.my **first** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have.  i will have to fabricate some protection.  my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4" monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i.e. not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer.  the speaker w/ 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it.  it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm, but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3db0 into the trs line in.  thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!i do like this set of speakers.  from stereo to 5.1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs.  i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already. 5
i ordered this for my husband, the musician.  he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel.  he would definitely purchase this product again. 5
the elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brand-new 'sound' a lot longer than any other brand.  i am very happy with the elixir brand strings. 5
one of the strap buttons on a guitar i was given as a gift was missing.  i was told that it would need some minor repairs, so all i had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it.this strap button was screwed right in the minute i got it and it worked like a charm.  i put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn't given me any problems. 5
seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website, but there is no dealer anywhere near me, so i bought one sight-unseen from amazon, based on the good reviews. i'm glad to say i can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design.a traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction.  the narrow, reverse-taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom-heavy look when viewed vertically. back and sides are cherry with only a light stain, and the binding is dark. the top is natural cedar.as dreadnoughts go, this one is very comfortable to play sitting down. it appears to be based on the martin outline, but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout. weight is pleasantly light, and the semi-gloss finish is comfortable to the touch. players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard, but those with small hands should consider the ""slim" version, with a neck 0.08" narrower at the nut.sound is what really counts, however, and this canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there. the maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high-quality, fresh strings, allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up. overall, it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category, with good volume.buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer. both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering, and the truss rod required adjustment (a long-reach hex wrench is included). if you are not experienced in these tasks, a local luthier should do it for no more than $30 or so.based on sound, playability once adjusted, and construction quality, this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range. it is a real standout in value.update 8 dec 2012: the more i play this guitar, the more i love it. it delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought "snap", and once the action was dialed in, the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding i didn't fully realize hindered my playing. i am considerng replacing my takamine mini-jumbo with a seagull equivalent. 5
great deal on a capo, it's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere.  it takes a while for the shipping, but that's stated in the description.  i was pleasantly suprised.  i would recommend this capo. 5
this is a very comfortable strap.  because it is cotton, this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps.  it fits the guitar perfect, and is easy to adjust.  well made, and you can't beat the price. 5
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass.  applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets, wipes right up.  a must to keep wood looking fresh. 5
if you are a mobile dj that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these.  it saves me 5 minutes per event (setup and break down) just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event. 5
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar. they are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. we've tried d'addario, brighter sound (d'addario acoustic guitar strings set, exp 80/20 lite), and martin, a little stiff (martin strings sp phosphor bronze 12.5-55 msp4150). in the end, these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.as has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. for the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.on the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. fresh strings do sound better. it's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. but i'm not certain these last so much longer. we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.june 15, 2010 update: elixir is a wonderful company. on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings, the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.the other amazing thing - i've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and i'm still very confused. the elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings. i swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. it is so simple and so reproducible. i love this technique.i'm a huge fan of these strings now! 5
a strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? it was about $5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine. it's comfortable and fits my bass well. i'm a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it. nice value. 5
i bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... this is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it. 5
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both. the h4n is a great versatile field recorder. i mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. the h4n is a work horse. it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. i highly recommend purchasing a "furry head" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.unlike the h1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the h4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. however, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. i had this happen once. if this happens to you, don't worry. i searched the internet and was able to find several zoom certified service centers within my general area. i called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the h4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; i didn't pay a dime. i had it shipped off and back in 7 days.all in all the h4n is a great field recorder. i mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two xlr inputs at the same time. in some cases i also use a small 4 channel behringer field mixer if i have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly.i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n. as i said earlier, purchase a "furry head" wind screen. i use the furry head wind screens every time i record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. i only use 32gb sandisk sd cards because sandisk is dependable, i have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. i record at 48k @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. this allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case i forget to transfer the audio files along with video when i edit. i also suggest having a di box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. i have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a di box from venue mixers. this has to do with a balance and padding that i am just not going to get into but trust me, a di box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. i also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. always be prepared. i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues. battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.i do not regret this purchase at all. the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. i highly recommend purchasing one. 5
i like the planet waves instrument cables. the cable material is very bendable and easy to work with. great so far. 5
this isn't the best strap, but it's affordable and pretty good for a beginner's guitar strap. the pick holder on the strap is pretty neat, however i don't find myself using it often. the guitar strap is not very comfortable, but it does the job. recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar. don't forget to buy strap locks, you will need it. 3
sounds like a great concept and they seem well made. i just don't care for them. i know others love them so i guess it's just a personal thing.it took weeks to receive them in the us. don't be in a rush. 4
in my opinion...this is the best amp in this category. i know people who have the marshall and the fender. i plugged into my little honeytone and i had the best sounding micro amp hands down. they were both amazed with the sound. they said "well mine was only $45 and "mine was only $40." too bad so sad for them. i told them mine was $20. since it doesn't say marshall or fender, i only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp. if you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts, and know what to expect from a micro, this amp does not disappoint 5
the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings i want more pressure, i advise getting the ns capo that is not "lite",  i prefer that one above this model. 2
i recently changed them out for a different type of eb's while they were good the were not exactly what i was looking for. not sure the new set is either but time will tell. 4
what to say about this except that they mounted properly, came with the right screws and i didnt have any issues. lol 5
for me this stand is very well built, not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price. they don't touch the floor. there are safety straps that hold my 3 acoustic guitars (fender, ibanez and my anybody's guess antique)in place without any difficulty, so i don't have to worry about knocking them off or over. it takes up very little space, the biggest plus! 5
i decided to get this tweed strap for my 50s telecaster classic, but when it arrived, i was a bit let down. the tweed finish is cool enough, but the strap is very thin, and the strap ends are pretty poor quality. if they truly are made of leather, i feel sorry for the hide they came from. the leather is so hard, you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locks.this is decent for the time being, but i am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar. feels like wearing a $10 casio with a $1300 suit... 3
considering the price is so cheap on these, i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. to say that i used it "rarely" is an understatement - maybe once a month when i have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges. that said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up.aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. however, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero. 2
i have one of these in every one of my cases. it's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it; nothing special but it does the job. 5
the behringer us600 is well-made. the high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused. it is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass mode.i purchased the us600 specifically for the &#34;detune&#34; effect. this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps. the effect is particularly dramatic when outputs a & b are fed into two different amps, giving a nice room-filling stereo effect.i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects. the pitch shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect, about as good as i have heard anywhere. when using both outputs, it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp. this makes the guitar sound huge!the harmonist effect is amusing, but it has limited uses. it won't make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony. however, it is handy for short solos. i tried it in the key of g and got useful results.the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal. the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound.overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals. i have seen several speak ill of it, but i'm not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal. there is quite a learning curve on this gadget, but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the device.one other observation: this is more of a studio effect than a road effect. there are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect. it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor. i had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments. the only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect (detune, for example) while gigging.in conclusion, i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect. i'm glad i finally decided to get it. the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price. the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus. the other effects are icing on the cake. kudos to behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior! 4
i bought two sets of these for two of my fender 4x10 bass cabinets. i slipped them right in using the original fender screws since they're machine screws (eb comes with wood screws). very solid. 5
i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents.  besides the risk to my guitar, there is the cost.  for the price i paid for this guitar, i will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  i had it shipped to my parents when i bought it, and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  it has much better tone than i expected, and very good action.  stays in tune very well.  i am very happy with my purchase.  recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party. 4
i bought it for my church and the drum sounds great... i love the quality and the sound... buy it without doubts 5
very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well.  exactly as described in the ad. 4
bought stand as a gift for my son's acoustic guitar.  he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand.  can't go wrong for the price. 5
soume times you just need a transformer-based, low amperage power supply for pedal where the switchmode-based, modern supplies are just too noisy.  this was the cheapest.  so it goes. 5
this little amp is amazing.  it's loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps, and you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp.  i love it!  if you need a practice amp (and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private) then this is the amp you  should buy.  the price is right, and the size is right.  enough said.  buy it! 5
well this amp does have it's pros and cons, however the cons are overshadowed by the pros.pros:1) small!!!! 2) sounds like a big combo amp 3) makes overdrive pedals sound better 4) sustain 5) big bottom bass 6) hd construction and components. 7) i can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback. 8) it soundsreally good!cons:1) yes, it "could" be louder 2) not "bright"now the details,  i have a tube combo amp and in comparison the zt is a bit on the dull side as far as presence.its not that it does not have it, just could use more. however this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion. solos just sing on this amp.  i feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better. the ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way.  i stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good. i also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when i first turn it on (seems to go away). i know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally. it also seems to have a positive compression/pumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ring.volume?  for a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill. mic'ing for larger venues would work just fine.if you're in a loud band, you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option. (darn i meant to test before this review). tip- so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the1/8" aux input on the back. i tested this and yes, it does go louder for whatever the reason. (i'll be getting a blank 1/8"jack to put it that aux port) a small but very noticeable volume increase. if you need to be louder then i suggest the larger zt, but its double the price. a friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore. the 12 club zt is super loud.i can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback.1-100 i rate this a 98% gear head satisfaction. remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 6.5" speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little box.check it out the reviews on youtube.part ii -ok, the extension cabinet option: hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder. however do not use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet - turn the switch off. it will overheat the amp and start acting weird. i found out the hard way, verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker. i would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both. you'll know if you touch the back of the amp and its more than warm, but i would not recommend it. 5
these are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine i've always been a huge fan of jim dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come 5
i have used many clip-on guitar tuners. they are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on. i have several of them and use them often on many guitars. based on this experience, i was anticipating a better experience with this new mini headstock tuner than i wound up getting.it tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. others found it awkward to attach - i did not. it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. those are not problems. what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.this fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.the fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the planet waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. this clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and i expect it to break after only a short time. consequently, i cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.if the need is for a tuner that attaches to one instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. if you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of planet waves tuners.november 28,2011 updatehaving used this tuner for a while now, i have found that it has a good purpose. while this tuned does have mobility issues as i initially noted, i have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. i leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. a non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. based on this belated realization, i have raised the product rating to 4-stars. 4
this stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands, jammers and home studio owners because i run across them everywhere. and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own. here is what i have learned during the four or so years i have owned and used this model:- for the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped.)- they hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theblue microphones encore 100 studio-grade dynamic performance microphone. not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.i lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when i try to extend or collapse the center pole. those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's. as for the binding - i am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands. had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat. however, i now use theseismic audio - tripod microphone mic boom stand - pa/dj/band/church/wedding use, which i consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price. also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue i have found the old school styleon stage mc7201b round base microphone stand, blackto be a far better solution. 4
this is a great little tuner for guitar. love the fact i can tune all 6 strings at the same time 5
great starter uke. got this for my wife she just loves it. stays in tune. good sound.the price was right. 5
i have found that everything schaller make's is grade a-#1 in my book. made in germany ( not china ) these locks are fast and secure. i like the way they slide on & off which if your like me having to change guitar's during a show or just at home, the change is smooth and safe. no dropping guitar's around here !!! i have them on all my guitar's. 5
i started to play the violin a few months ago.  when i got my violin, i purchased the korg ca1 chromatic tuner thinking i would not need a metronome.  the korg ca1 also cost slight less.  however, now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome.  she has the korg tm40 metronome.  i opted to purchase the newer model korg tm50pw instrument tuner and metronome.  it is great.  based on my experience, unless you are sure you do not need a metronome, i would recommend everyone purchased the tm40 or tm50 (just in case) instead of the ca1. 5
the tuner is great  -  seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease. my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back, doesn't hold it at an angle that i find very usable.  otherwise? a fine product that i expect to last for years. korg makes great tuners. i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus. if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen, i'd replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models. 4
works as advertised.  i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived, but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work.  pretty simple, even if you're "technically challenged."  easy to use.  haven't gigged with it yet, but i can imagine that this strap "isn't going anywhere," regarding its functionality.  not a "pretty" product, but good stuff. 5
having 250 feet of xlr - xlr (m-f) cables that can be used any way i want (e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo, 1 250 foot for mono, or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work) is very flexible.the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord (white) to store them when not in use.as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors, this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job.  i ended up using all 10 of the 25' cords for mics and amplified speakers, plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect.  you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters! 5
i paid only $29 and it is small and convenient. i was impressed with the sound.at first i played it with my line 6 15 watt amp. i didn't like it cause of the squealing. but then i read how you use it and all that. boy! it worked great.i use it with a tascam us 100 usb plugin to my computer and i get a good sound for practice.i still like my line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain. but this is a bargain and small.you can use this with any usb audio interface.if you like ac/dc you would like this. there are different amp sounds you can get.cheap and convenient i'am not disappointed.my opinion is that it sounds best with a usb guitar audio device such as tascams us 100. 5
i have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. the price is right for these, and they work just fine. my only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. however, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market. 4
what does anyone really want to know about a string winder.  yes it will help you string your instrument quicker.  and yes, it's still in one piece. i would buy it again.  you may even buy 2 because the same gnomes that steal pick's and capo's take these too. 5
i don't use it for any heavy use.  i use it for podcasting purposes.  haven't had any problems.  so i can't speak to really heavy use of the product. 5
my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks. he says it's easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder. highly recommend! 5
i have had them on my loar guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine.  we will see how long they last.  i have used elixir for electric and while they do last longer i wish it was a bit longer. 4
all three of my kids have a guitar. they were always losing their picks. this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while! all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar. i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks! 5
this was a great purchase.  a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar.  good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them.  great price and purchase. 4
works very well.  i have to of them.  each does a little different thing,  they are great for traveling, or late night need to play stuff, when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better.  the sound, effects, etc., are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication. 4
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs.  next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a tusq.  this should improve my sustain and tone even more.  if you're looking for a budget increase of tone ... this is a way to go. 5
yes!  i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock!  it never needs to be removed!  it's accurate.  it's easy to use.  it's low-profile.  highly recommended. 5
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars, not acoustic or acoustic/electric guitars.  the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars.  this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars.  i love its size and portability. 5
my banjo arrived a couple days after i ordered it. it tuned up very easily, and for me it holds tune nicely. it has a good ring to it. so far i have only had to replace one string, but that was most probably due to inadvertently letting it sit in front of a forced air heating vent. 5
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it. . . once.normally, after tuning new strings for the first time, i break them in by rigorously bending them, using the whammy bar and tugging on them then i re-tune them. i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays. not with these strings. tuned them once, no breaking in.it sounds amazing on clean; on its own without any effects, and the natural sustain is great. they also sound good with any settings i use.i bought two sets. 5
first things first. if you have one or many expensive guitars buy these. they keep you guitar safe from falling. to take it off all you do is hold down a button in the side and your strap and the lock with pop off. it's very handy. very very easy to install and protects. be warned they are bigger than they look but to do what they do so well they must be big. 5
i have the small version. but for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more. i used in all my concerts and its excellent! 100% recommended! 5
bought these for home karaoke and they work great. i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally. why spend more? my dj business includes up to 4 shure wireless mics at around $500 a piece but these inexpensive nady's seem just about as good in sound and performance (very few drop-outs if you stay within 30 feet of the receiver). i'll probably start taking these on gigs since they are so affordable to replace if they break. 5
i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires.  bought this kit.  it is just super.  the 'one spot' provides the power needed, the wiring is just right for the pedals i've installed.  this is a great set,....all you'll need to get your pedal train wired and running. 5
so i just got this product, haven't used it!package looks ok,strings are pakced in one plastic bagi can't wait to try this one, i've also bought martin m1400, ghs silk and steel, will come back with results! 4
i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record, the notes don't bend easily...if you think your will cheat the big boys harps, youll be dissapointed quickly...these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps, they feel cheap but have a decent sound ...i dont know if they will last, but to make harp noises without decent bends ... ill use these sparingly...jim 2
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk. imports often have threads other than 1/4 inch sae. it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads. quick install, works like a dream. 5
i am 65 years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months.  as you can imagine, i need to practice a lot!  my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing...especially when i practice monotonous scales.i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor's web site.  i love it!  easy to put on and take off. the rubber won't hurt your violin, bridge or strings. you can barely hear it in the next room.  you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge.  my violin's tone doesn't change much at all with this mute.now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me! 5
they upgraded my 72 tele deluxe, they fit perfectly yet you have to push really hard on the finish at the headstock for it to go in without opening any holes on the wood. 5
these are my favorite guitar strings! they are very long-lasting and sound great!i would recommend these for anyone, beginners or even people who play seriously or perform. they are very good strings, worth the cost! :] 5
satisfies my needs . . . nice cloth covered, large strain relied, good plugs (put a bit of thread lock on them they unscrew almost unintentionally) . . . . like it even if it's a bit long for use at home. 4
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with.  for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings.  i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right.  i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings.  i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings. 2
it's sturdy, well made, and cheap.  you couldn't go out and buy the raw material and put something like this together for what you pay for it.  i've used it with a couple of amps and it'll handle up to say an ac30 without an issues. 4
i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night. i typically practice sitting down without a strap when i am alone, but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band. i had previously used a very expensive 2" padded leather cradle type strap, which i really liked. i sold that banjo and the strap with it, but recently re-acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap, but was not willing to pay the $80 again for a premium padded leather strap. i saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance. i am glad i did.this strap may not be as elegant as fine leather, but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction. what blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo, which weighs about 14 pounds, literally felt half as heavy. it is no joke. at first, the feeling was unnerving, because the strap has some elastic give to it. you get this dual sensation of a) the banjo feeling super light and b) as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor. paradoxical i know, but that's where the magic of this strap is. it is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you, but in reality it remains very stable when playing.like i said, the build quality is outstanding. my only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non-traditional, so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument, like a 5-string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap.this is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point. i think i might try these on my electrics (though i already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps). 4
i use 2 to stereo mic my egnater, works great, nice sound, to my ears not much different from an sm-57 and is a fraction of the price. it's not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me! too noisy for hand held vocals, put it a mic stand instead. 5
really helpful both in live gigs and at home.great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand 5
hi i need this item for travelling and it has work very well. i am pleased i have purchased this little yet great product. 5
i've tried kyser capos and they're good. they work. this capo, however, just works simply, smoothly, and it's a great pleasure to operate. like a seagull vs a taylor 8 series, they both work, but one has more beauty in its being. made in china, designed in europe, slippery, a bit heavy, but still very, very nice. it's more money than i'd have liked to have paid, but i'm glad i did. did it improve my life? not at all. it also didn't improve my guitar playing - but somehow it's just so much nicer to have than any other capo i've used. 5
i ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church.  it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews.  i found it to be excellent for the price and so far, have had no problems with the zippers.this product is described as a "soprano ukulele gig bag" and that is exactly what it is.  a "gig bag" is *not* a rigid faa-approved flight case, nor is it a semi-rigid polystyrene "case" with soft covering.  reviewers that don't believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a "gig bag" and don't understand the term.  you wouldn't put your reading glasses in a soft, padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you?i don't know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert-sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag, but i found that it fits the soprano size perfectly.  it is *very well padded* for a gig bag, having extra padding at the base of the instrument (where the bottom strap button would be if you have one) to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end.  it also has a nicely padded handle.  i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well.  (ukulele not included.  they cost a little more than this.) 5
strings are so subjective and perform so differently depending on the instrument, i have a hard time reviewing them. i have them on an older mim p bass and am quickly falling in love with them. i tried ghs flats on this bass previously- about all i can say is meh (too rough - they feel more like half rounds, just not the right tone on this particular instrument). i've got another p bass (fretless) with labella jamerson's on it (which are still my favorite flats), but these are a close second. add to that they're half the price of the labella's, and we've got an easy winner. they're silky smooth, and probably more versatile than the labella's as there's plenty of top end for a wide variety of styles and music. my tone knob has never been more useful! 5
it's nothing special.  no frills, just a simple concept that works.  it's important to maintain humidity in your instrument, especially in a dry climate like west texas.  the evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.so, when you first start using it, you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist. 3
i buy and sell electric guitars and often i meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. i was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  there is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  i bought a planet waves 9v power adapter to go with the honey tone.  it might work in a busker situation. 5
i've used this strap on different guitars and it works great on all of them.  if you're looking for an economical strap this will work great.  my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products. 5
put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well...  love it to death, had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility.  the built in volume knob it a great tough.  i could go on, but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here. 5
only used it a couple times so far but i like it. i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar. as someone else mentioned it's hard to get the cloth back into the clear plastic bag inside the lid, though. but otherwise i think it's great. i like how it smells (does that make me strange?). 5
this capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar. if i position it just so it will work as long as i don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side. 1
bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. doesn't fit perfect. kinda bummed but oh well 1
i first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. the product description didn't mention that, but i was pleased to receive more than three!my son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing ozzy osbourne songs i knew he needed a better pick than the standard fender picks he's been playing with for three years. after hearing him play with these picks, i've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. the finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. i wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment. we'll be buying these for a long time to come. 5
am totally pleased that i did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it ! works great,get one!!! 5
although im not onstage bouncing aroung...they hold the strap on just fine...no changing hardware like strap locks...yes..more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice...but i will order more.. 4
the case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories. it does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality. the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used. otherwise great case, highly recommended. 5
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations. when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it. 5
high quality hassle free design.  very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  very happy with this purchase. 5
these daddario exl110 strings are light, responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great.  they work great. why use anything else? 5
the name says it all. fast fret = fast fingers!  i played over 40 live shows from 45 min sets to 2.5 hr sets just this year on national stages.  my strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat, grime, and dirt flying through the air. this stuff honestly works very well.  it is part of my regular arsenal. 5
this is definitely a sturdy and well made stand - i have no fault with it about that. solid materials, everything snaps and latches tightly. good materials. works just like it's supposed to.i have two complaints about it, though.1. the part that holds the music isn't as wide as other stands. i probably could have read the description and realized that, but i made the assumption that all stands are the same size. it's just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper. it will hold bigger things, of course, but the edges will go past the edge of the stand. so it works, but to me, it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges. the ledge is nice and wide, though, so it can hold some pretty thick stuff. but if you are using quite wide materials, especially if they are loose-leaf, you will want to look for a wider stand.2. adjusting the height and tilt is difficult. to alter the height, one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring (like one finds on microphone stands). it doesn't just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands i've encountered in life. adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back, which is a bit difficult to reach. unlike every other music stand i've used that one can simply force into position. the good news of this is, though, that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring, everything stays right where one puts it. no slow sliding down in height, no slow tilting backwards.on the plus side, they are sturdy, and the feet can be retracted (is that the word?) so that they are parallel to the stand, making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy. i love the fact that the feet do this.these are excellent music stands. 4
i love this pedal! that said i would like to address some of the reviews i see on here. i have been playing guitar since i was 14 years old. i am now 57 so i have a few years of experience. first you guys who complain about the plastic housing. are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals? if you are stop doing it. all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works. the plastic housing is extremely strong and won't bust when used properly. the next thing i would like to address is the battery running down &#34;even when it's turned off&#34;. every effects pedal i ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it. get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain. it will save you a fortune. the ones saying the sound sucked, buy something besides a $50 amp, and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain. thi is a good pedal and i've used it on stage for 2 years without a problem. that means i have spent about $11 a year for a pedal that has earned me thousands! buy one, learn how to use it and you'll be happy. 5
yes, ever so slightly. does it give you more sustain? none that i can really tell. people have been debating whether a steel, brass, or pot metal block makes a difference in tone and sustain. i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass. this is what is giving the deeper sound. the strings go over the bridge pieces and so i don't think material matters for the block much, if at all. i think it is about the actual mass. people who will say it makes a big difference are suffering from the placebo effect. without debate, this will add weight to your guitar. i think for the price, it is worth upgrading the thin old style mexican blocks. this is pot metal as well, which, again, is fine. the rest of the assembly is well made, as well, and seems just like the stock bridge you would find on a stock mim strat. if you are thinking of going gfs blocks, this is cheaper, and will fit perfectly without you having the problems of not having holes line up etc., which is a common complaint and indicative of gfs's crummy products in general. i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another. 4
i already owned two of these tuners previously & purchased these for friends. they are great for jamming with friends & are so user friendly & accurate. what is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze. i love mine & so do my friends. in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat. 5
i'm using these on the mandolin. perfect for clear loud picking. when i want a more gentle muted tone i use d'andrea pro 346.these are very tiny picks, much much smaller than pictured. i have very small hands so they work for me. they are not slippery which helps. 5
it is all preference. i prefer the cactus picks. these slide around in my finger to much right now. to each his own. 3
these little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..i'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. the product description says 6 inches, right? if you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b001pgxkc8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=utf8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) the hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up.to conclude, would i recommend these? yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else. 4
bought a couple of these to build pre-loaded pickguards for strats. they work just fine, nice solid feel, screws included, and white or black tips. there are two rows of connectors 5
these are great strings! break in quickly and hold their tune, work for all styles of playing. my go to strings from now on. 5
my classical guitar stand was metal and short, like this, but did not have the front brace or download slant. if i had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it's headstock on the hard flood. so sad. i mourn it still. 5
i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item. it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows.the chrome on the sides looks very cool. makes it look really smart.the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom.the sound of this wah is pretty much exactly like hendrix clapton from the sixties. its a wah and wah and does just that.i tried it on both clean and distorted sounds and it sounds great on both.i'm not sure if its a true bypass but i have a feeling it is. because when its switched on without the battery there's no sound coming from it. correct me if i"m wrong.it's different sounding from the crybaby wah. you should listen to both to know which is right for you. i wanted the "tales of brave ulysses" sound so i went with this. 5
i have several capos & this one really surprised me for the price. it's light-weight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck. compared to my g7th which costs 3 times more, it is a great buy. i really like planet waves products. they are made well & last. 5
nice to keep your mic nice and fresh. plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath. decent value! 5
seriously, this is a great pedal. i can't improve upon what others have said, but i will mention a few points.1. i use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone, or to add more crunch to my fender frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. it's run before time based effects (delay, phaser, etc) for me.2. i sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster, while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. if it gets noisy or "self oscillates" after a while, change the battery to a fresh one. better yet, use an ac adapter.i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews. otherwise, it's been on my setup for about seven years. i take care of my stuff. 4
at &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag. it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying. these are also easily removed if they bother you. this epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics. 4
i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine. it hasn't seen heavy use. it wasn't supposed to. it sits in a corner of the living room, holds the guitar securely, and doesn't cause problems. although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious, and my 91 yo neighbor was convinced for a year that i was drunk and  wailing away on the guitar at 3 am. at least, that's what she told the police.this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musician's gear stand. they might actually be the same stand under different names. the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping. if i were to buy a stand again, i would still get this one because it's available under prime. the other one isn't. that gives this stand more value.the stand is very easy to set up. the lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar. this took a little getting used to, but it does work very well. the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well. extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems.given the very low price, this is an excellent choice for a living room stand. if you're on the road or performing, you might need something a bit different, but i can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself. 5
i love these strings. i get a much higher output , much better response and much better sound. great strings for just a little more. 5
i always go with elixirs. great, long-lasting sound! i would recommend these to anyone, both experienced players and amateurs alike. 5
there are two ways guitar strings go bad. if you leave them on long enough, the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode- but that takes months, if not more. before that happens, grease from your fingers, dust, bits of skin, and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings, between the windings. this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound. back when strings were a lot more expensive, some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them; some bass players still do. coated strings are a simpler alternative.these strings and similar ones like elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings, which accomplishes two things: first, it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap, which prevents rust and corrosion. second, it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings. the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings. they do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings, but it's not a huge difference, and after a month or two they still sound the same.they also cost about twice as much as equivalent non-coated d'addarios. are they worth it? that depends. if you're an active performer, maybe. you're probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you're getting a bright sound. you're probably also buying your strings by the box. there's no real benefit to these strings. where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy. these days i'm strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year. i have four acoustic guitars, and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played. with coated strings, i can leave a set on a guitar, and a month or two later i can pull it out of the case and it's ready to play. i still change strings if i'm going to be playing in public, but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house, these are great. 5
if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button, these are great buttons to use.  it comes with two buttons, two washers and 4 screws (two different sizes). 5
a great universal bag. i can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body. has great pockets to carry your picks, strings, and tuners. the padding is better that i expected. it does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color. 4
this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer, it works as expected and has proven to be durable.  i don't hesitate to drop it in my gig bag, knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show. 5
simple and useful rack stand. easy to assemble. easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality. 3
love the security of having my picks within grasp!  great product and great value! i would highly recommend this to others. 5
hey it's a pick, it's 10 to a bag....i lost one already so now i have 9.  i my world that's good stuff. 5
this is a very good piece of equipment for its price. used mildly, it gives the sound a more natural feel. 4
the reverb broke in my amp and i tried the boss frv-1 to replace it and didn't really like it too much.  then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby.  this is exactly what i wanted.  it fills out the sound and yet doesn't add any artificial high end.  sounds gorgeous for what i do, which is playing alone in a basement.  for most songs it's always on, and it really excels at vintagy-sounding stuff like rockabilly and surf.  the mod button is a nice add-on but i haven't really bonded with it yet.if i had to buy this over again i might consider the aqua puss because i don't use the high delay times all that much and the aqua puss has an easy access battery door. 5
i'm using it for my alesis q49 midi keyboard.  folds up easy so i can tuck it away.  it may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys.  as you lower it the support spreads out wide.  good quality.  adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard. 5
i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line: if you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. for everyone else, look elsewhere. 2
tuner works great. both by vibration and mic.only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. mine broke off... not even a year old. 2
this is a great music stand.  very solid  feel.  no need to over tighten the adjusters.  it holds my heaviest books without tipping over. 5
this amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers, and name on an old card, and give guitar picks at the same time. the edges are a little rough, but it is a punch not a precision cutter. one of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed. 5
