well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...it's exactly what you would expect from behringer, it works...it's not great but it get's the job done, i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but it's still pretty useful for less than $25i don't regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withdanelectro d-8 fab 600ms delaywell, maybe next time...i give it a 3 out of 5, it wasn't this time behringer surprised me. 3
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  some say that the grip is good.  here's my take -- for what it's worth.  i've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  round and flat wound strings.  my general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  it's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  also note, i play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  so the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  i do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  i've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what i've found so far.  i find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars i'm currently playing.  the process of finding the "right" pick is never ending and changes over time.  give these a try and let me know what you think. 4
i was using slinkys for several years but decided to give these a shot because the slinkys kept corroding so quickly. anyway, these seem to hold up a little better. both sound good, but these last a couple weeks longer. so stock up! 5
very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well.  exactly as described in the ad. 4
to be honest i'm not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion. i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix, one of the best names in the business. and for the fact it was cheaper than most. i'm very pleased with the pedal and couldn't be happier. 5
not perfect but a solid stand. prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do. and the bottom part that holds the guitar isn't fixed so it's good and bad. good because it'll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles. bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do, sometimes it just swings around annoyingly. 4
in my house, i don't have to play quietly when rehearsing.... but when i really want to play along with a song and put some 'volume' to it, i can do it now without even a concern for our dogs, the neighbors, or my wife.  this device, as the product description tells you, allows you to plug it into your bass, plug your earbuds or headphones into it, set the volume and gain controls to suit, and play away in complete quiet to the rest of the world.  in addition, and this is the best part, there's a 1/8&#34; jack on this device that allows you to plug an mp3 player into it so you can play along with music of your choice.  i rehearse often with this thing.  you might think negatively about this device considering the fact that you can't control all the tone parameters like you can when rehearsing through your bass amp.  that's true.  but, the big thing is being able to use it for what it was designed for and all the ways it makes rehearsing simpler (less equipment-complicated) and quiet when necessary (lots of households have that need for quiet that don't always blend well with your rehearsal schedule, etc).  i paid $50 for it, and it works great,...worth the money for certain. 5
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session. a guitar is an investment and you should protect it. a good polish cloth is a must. 5
replaced my old bridge assembly with this new one and it really brought the strat back to life in terms of looks and feel. also this was priced right in my opinion.... 5
the item came quickly and as decribed. it clamps on my acoustic just fine, no string buzz or damage to the neck so far. 5
i do question the leather part but since it doesn't say what kind of leather i suppose thats fine, its still a good strap either way. 5
this is very inexpensive and works great for my home-wanna be purposes.  it is not superloaded with heavy delay, etc. but it definitely gives you the effect.  it links well with other pedals.  the battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a 9 v plug in.  therefore, i would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard 9v plug in on amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead.i like it enough that i will probably get a few more of this company's petals as the effect is good and the price is right.for my limited purposes, this works great.  if you are a pro gigging or on the road, you probably want to get a more versitile, heavy duty and expensive delay petal. 5
i love these strings.  i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these, i really enjoyed them.  after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase.  no desire to test other strings.  especially after this bundle/value. 5
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned, they are not large at all. i have average size hands and thumbs and the pick initially numbed my thumb in about twenty seconds it was so tight. i solved the problem by simply holding a bic lighter flame about a half inch away from the heel of the pick for just about three seconds. i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly. it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit. it's actually easy to completely customize the size and shape of the picks with just a few seconds of heat. the picks fit fine now, and i didn't even need to place &#34;foreign&#34; objects into the microwave to do it.any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can. thanks.spo 4
so i am a big fan of the sm57 microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality.i have a bunch of the large style condenser microphones (rode nt1-a, at2020, sp c-1) and they are clear, but so sensitive that it's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room. so if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a dynamic mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.i did an a / b test against the sm7b i just bought and the sm57 (i love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. i sung the same passage as well, and i have to say - the sm57 sounds muddy in comparison to the sm7b. if i didn't have this new microphone i would still like the sm57, but the genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. the sm7b is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.dynamic singers ( rock, jazz, gospel, opera )= if you have the budget get this sm7b and if you don't, buy the sm57 until you do have the budget.quiet singers (acoustic , folk ) = if you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard large condenser mics as listed above. of those type, i like the studio projects c-1 best i think, but they are close. 5
it's a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp. ( have a 65' twin reverb fender tube ) ya get one hell of a hum. it's so bad i just can't use it at all. i'm not sure about a transistor amp. but who uses those ???? 2
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing.  the idea is good and its cute.  its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out.  how many of these types of noise boxes do we need?  not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it.  go buy a 20 watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also.  or any combo little amp.  it's for bedroom use only.  you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire.  being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you.  just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot. 2
small. light weight. stunning fender blackface looks. warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive. the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up. the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me. it is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio. the direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself. what could be easier? and it mikes well too, by the way. the choice is yours there.with no led display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too. the voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates. the tweed, blackface, and marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp.love the reverb in the fx section. the spring reverb is so well done that i bumped the amp once and was looking for the "spring chrash" known from amps with the real spring reverb. it's that good. once again, the controls are easy and direct. never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort. who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? you want that, go waste your money on a line 6 or something. this champ is made for one thing. to give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort. i believe it has accomplished that well.again, a shame that fender has dropped this model from the line up of products. the super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well. i'm just glad that i got one of these from amazon. com when i did and will not part with the amp. been playing for five decades now and i know when i have a good instrument or gear and when i don't. this model is a keeper to be sure. and i don't even like digital! how's that for an endorsement? it's that good for what it does.... 5
extreamly easy to use, you can tune any instrumet witn this.  the display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark.  you can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument.  the price couldn't be better, i just can't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists. 5
my guitar originally came with d'addrio exp and they sounded good. i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. this time i got a 3 pack of ej16-3d light. the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.but the sound is the problem. it's terrible. they sound very muddy. crisp tone distinction is just not there. i thought light would be the better route, but now i'm not sure. i purchased some others to try. also, since a purchased a 3 pack. i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings. 2
looks vintage but works great at a great price. as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money! 5
i use this to mount my stagg small musical stand to hold a small format mixer for gigs. it's light weight and sturdy. 4
it's perfectly fine for standard, fairly stationary use. we use these at my church, and they get moved around a little bit, but not much. for the price, they are surprisingly solid, and they work perfectly fine.of stands in this price range, this is at the top of what i've experienced.it's easily adjustable, the screws stay tight once adjustments are made, it's light but not so light that it tips or blows over, the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling.seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around, this is the one to go with.if you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and/or going on tour, shipping around in airplanes or vans, etc., you will need to go up a notch or two in quality (and, sadly, price). 3
i bought this since i am a new guitar player...it does hit the frets but doesn't seem to do any damage...pretty easy to use.the only oddity i have is that the box was kind of open already when i bougt it new.does the job. 4
it works beautifully. arrived on time as promised as expected it is durable and it is easy and accurate as well, is as described. 5
i just got done installing these. my three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore, my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time, and my guitars won't tip over either. not only was this the least expensive solution out there, but also the most space efficient (to keep my wife happy).i used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud. you can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers didn't get covered with drywall mud. once you've found one screw, then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart. with the mounts screwed into wood studs, i don't see any way these are coming down. the mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic, to my heavy electric strat, to my mandolin beautifully.gotta love amazon. with so many options to choose from, you can come up with something great and inexpensive too. and the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the product.btw, this seller really got these to me fast. this was a great buying experience. thanks displaygiftscom. 5
while i have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting.  after using the zoom h4n for a few weeks i've found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster's arsenal of gear.i mainly use the h4n to record my podcasts using a allen & heath zed14 mixing board.  i usually do a two person podcast where i am in one location and the other person is brought in via skype.  using the aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the h4n i can record myself in one channel, the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my ipad into its own stereo channel.  this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track.the sound quality of the h4n is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit.  you can hook up either two xlr microphones or two 1/4&#34; jack sources (or a combination) to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1/8&#34; input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source.  it's the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracks.the h4n will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well, which could be useful if you're looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed.overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field, letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments.  five stars without a doubt. 5
i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass. i bought this jim dunlop mc401 mxr because i have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless i boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand. this stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all. of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost. this thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on. for my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough. naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot.the mc401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but i also separately ordered the dunlop ecb003 ac adapter, which is also available at amazon. i checked the jim dunlop website and in its facs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so i did not order the ecb004, which is an 18-volt model. the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.the mc401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put. the stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself. everything is solid as a rock. i don't see how it could be better. perfect. 5
a great little tuner. very accurate, easy to use and the batteries last the better part of a year. i bought 3 or 4 of these and i put in my gig bags or cases. at these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments. 5
i can't believe these were actually sent to me. the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china. i am sending them back. there is no way i would use these. any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 1
received the unit, plugged it into my alesis q25, tested it in logic pro x and it works fine. the pedal itself is solid, nothing more to say, happy with purchase. 4
i've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. i recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings.the different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one. i was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well. the string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. so handy! 5
i had always wanted a phase shifter but i never wanted to pay alot of money for one because its not something i had to have but i just wanted one. the reason i bought this one was because it was cheap. i got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool. you can get some insane sounds out of it. i mean some are so insane i asked myself what could someone possibly use this with in a song. but it's great. it does what it is suppose to do and it is a sturdy stomp box. couldn't ask for more. 5
anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that i am not fond of the snark displays.  i prefer the "needle" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  however, that's me and ymmv, as they say on the internet.don't ask, then, why i got a sn-6.  i don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and i like to play with accessories.i am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  they all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.well, that's not *quite* true.  some models suffer fits in certain situations.  the rapid fall of the old intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low e string on a martin dreadnought.  a web search will reveal countless workarounds.  i (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.lately, i've become enamored of thekala ka-ubassfs solid mahogany u-bass - fretted.  if you want a tuning challenge, the low bass e string is it.  the sn-6 hardly hiccups.  other tuners seem to do "okay" but require a little coaxing.  not the sn-6! that's 5 stars in my book! 5
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii.  monster cables are well constructed.  i have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug. 5
this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable i don't have problems with it tangling like i saw on one review 5
love these. they're sturdy . which is very important and was my biggest concern since my guitars are pretty heavy. they look so cool on the wall and everyone compliments and noticed my guitars now. love this so much. highly recommended 5
i have to say i was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but i was shocked at the sounds i could get.it took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone i wanted and off we went.for the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone  is worth twice as much.as far as durability i have had in a month used it 10 times, so far so good.i did purchase the protection plan for $10 so i'm covered for 2 years. 5
i was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that i need a humidifier for my guitar. at first i was not sure what i was looking for. i found the product without too much difficulty. i had learned from my instructor that these are small, placed on the hole of the guitar, and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition. i started looking through the computer pages and settled on the herco guitar humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product. now i feel i made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations, and good music! 5
this product works the way it should be. no frills, no bs. great price at amazon as usual. 5
this is a good quality product as advertised, fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument! i am satisfied. 5
i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars. good brand and good tone. 5 stars for this one. 5
i bought this guitar about 2 years ago and i have played tons of different acoustic guitars from taylor to fender and more. this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played. the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well. i love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars. additionally, this is my favorite guitar and i would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic. this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars. the guitar has no finish which i prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands. i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value. this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice. recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature i promise you won't be disappointed and i have been playing for 6 years so i know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar. thanks takamine!!!!! 5
i love a lot of danelectro products, but not really this one, i give it 3/5 because it works as advertised.the features are good. true bypass requires a 9v wall plug, and adjustments are good.but here's my issue- the distortion is not 'crunchy.' it distorts, sure, but the sound is not dimensional... it has no depth to it.thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres, but i play a lot of blues-rock... i ended up switching to a vintage-tube overdrive by behringer.not for me, maybe for you. 3
this pedal is "ok" by which i mean, i provides the basic functions it says it does. quality-wise, it feels a bit cheapish....i was afraid i was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it. the case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from. the power switch and chorus/vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find, and are not that easily accessible by a toe...you gotta bend over and flip those. they are small.on the other hand it was only sixty-nine-bucks - relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedal.i don't care for the rear facing upwardly angled input, output and power jacks. that's not pedal board friendly in my opinion. nice as a tabletop effect. the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 7.75" x 6.5" (approx). the "standard" 9v center negative power supply is a "postive" (excuse my pun.)if you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation - echos, vibratos, reverbs, old style choruses...this is not a bad way to get started playing with that. you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank.personally, i have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space, so for me...not a keeper. your situation might be different than mine.not a bad product, acceptable at it's price point, just didn't impress me much. 3
there's not much to say about this pick. i like medium picks and this feels comfortable.they wear a bit faster than i would expect, but far rom being a problem. it may just be my style.the 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity. 5
holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness. i stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by. 4
will this replace a pro fret job? nah...that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.end results[...] 5
these are the best strings i've ever put on my guitar, i play a really nice morgan monroe creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves. the bright highs, the rich mids, and they bend like crazy when i need them too 5
this works great for mic'ing guitar amps. the stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp. 5
the cm-2 is magnificent: [1] it produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone). [2] it has independent "high" and "low" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation. [3] it features a switch that allows you to pick between "classic" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion ("modified"). [4] the case is made of metal. [5] it comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal. this pedal will not give you "metal" distortion; for that consider digitech's tl-2. instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone. i love this thing! 5
i use these on all my guitars.  love them.  easy to assemble and use.  if you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  once installed they are fantastic. 5
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly. that's all there really is to say, if you need a sturdy guitar case  for a les paul styled guitar and don't want to spend a butt-load of money, look no further. 5
they all work and none of them have given any trouble. my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around (a lot). i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great. no regrets, rock on! 4
we've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. when i see the word microfiber i always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.this cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing i've tried before. with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.this would be great for any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.reasonably priced too. 5
arrived promptly.  nicely packaged.  holding my instruments securely.  i'll likely order more, and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts. 4
very versatile tuner. it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away! it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them. there are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy! 5
these are nice, i like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as i am.  once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  i also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  they stay in your fingers well. 4
i ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes.  it just works.i already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head. the problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously).  with a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place. chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck.this is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow.  the length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes. it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke. the other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way. in my case i installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand. here are the buttons i used:strap buttonsif the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside. it can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it. here's an entertaining how-to video that will walk you through it: (...) 5
great strings. bends are easy. stay in tune well. shipping was fast and i'd definitely recommend these. john mayer, and other of my favorite musicians use these strings, there great. 5
don't know why i didn't buy this years ago. i had a metal slide for years but always like a glass slide sound tone more. i like dunlop products... they are always good quality. price with amazon prime is a good buy. 5
ok, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. i've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. there is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. however, i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. i also really like the nylon material. it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. i like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. i keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be. 5
this is not my first guitar. nor am i breathless epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of taylors and martins. it's not. here's what it is: an exceedingly well-constucted, amazingly playable guitar. fit, finish, feel and action were all very nice... sound on the other hand? let's face it. it's plywood all around. it sounds like plywood. but that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks.it's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. it's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. leave it in your car to practice at lunch. leave it in the office. any guitar is better than no guitar... and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars.seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box... new, premium strings do make a difference.if your expectations are for a playable, rugged, affordable guitar you won't be disappointed. if sound quality is your primary concern, well... you are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.for my desired application, this guitar was great... i'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat. 4
who cares if they were used or hanging around the warehouse hey they went together and don't show any wear and tear to me...love them...thanks 5
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility.  easy to put together and holds my guitar very well. 4
i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two. sounded lovely for the first hour, that's why two stars. granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais, if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can't recommend personally. 2
this brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing. this is not a deep cleaning, dust or dirt removal brush; it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by last (last pc power cleaner 3/4 oz.).the brush is super simple to use, with the album on your turntable, hold it at roughly a ninety degree angle for about two revolutions, and then sweep it off the lp. no fuss, no muss, no fooling around. never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers. when there is visible dust on the fibers, give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers. after each use, rotate the handle around to cover the fibers. if you press the brush too hard against the album, or do the deep dive sharp angle trick, fibers will be broken off the brush. just press lightly against the rotating lp, sweep the brush off the lp, and all will be wonderful with this brush.this brush is sold under many different brand names, clearaudio, audioquest, and thorens.the brush comes with no instructions for use, an odd omission. maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use, instructions would be redundant.audiophile or not, this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings. 5
this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs.  you can jam for hours with this thing, it's awesome. 5
does what it says with no whining whatsoever, really quiet producing absolutely no audible hum. very small footprint, too! would i recommend it? yes. i would. 5
i ordered this product on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday. came very well packaged and with all the pieces. i was very easy to assembly and looks great! for the price, you really can't go wrong with this guitar stand. works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won't fall off. padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. great stand for the price!!! 5
i bought this strap for a esp ec-1000 les paul style guitar.  i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price. when i got the strap i was impressed. the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar. the back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they don't harm the finish on your guitar. locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open. it's not going to unlock on you. strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding. good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar. long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable. 4
worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased. definitely would purchase again, solid quality build. good purchase! 5
i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano (i have a pro model with xlr outs) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces.  works every time.  balanced signal is so much better...no more issues with ground loops or other problems.  just clear as a bell.they were cheap and the build quality is fine. 5
i purchased these cables for my behringer 802 mixer & mxl 770 mic and these cables are perfect! finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing i have the professional cables to back me up! the best xlr cables you can find. hands down. 5
i put this on my mandolin.  this does not work as well as some others i have tried, but the other one i was using broke very easily, so i looked for a different, more sturdy design.  this works ok.  not the greatest, but ok. 3
i like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. the red color is a metallic color - and i totally dig it. the display is nice and bright as well. super accurate tuning. well worth it for the price. 5
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away. excellent fer recording acoustic's 5
the one spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts.  get it, you won't be sorry. 5
this is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget.  it works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected. 5
i've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down.  i play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc., during a show. a couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish. i've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results.tip: a little goes a long way. i play every week, i use this stuff every time i put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle.  i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month.  :) 5
seriously, just stop.don't be like me and wonder what all the fuss is for years, just go ahead and get a pair. they are just awesome. when i finally got mine, i opted for the anniversary edition as they were on sale, and i am seeing the regular athm50s right now for $119!! that's crazy cheap.i had some rather inexpensive sony headphones for about eight years(still have them actually) that are comfy and sound good, but not entirely accurate. the athm50s are really solid studio headphones. i can't imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself. they exude quality and are comfy, even when i'm wearing my glasss which many headphones are not. not for long seasons anyway.i use the athm50s in my home studio and i have started taking them along in my gear bag for studio sessions along with a 15' headphone ext cable.i feel oso foolish having lived without these cans for so long, don't you do the same! 5
solidly built works just as a mic stand should..couldnt be happier..as long as i take care of this ill never need to buy a new one again. 5
i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning.  $4 for these 12 beautiful, premium quality picks is a steal. 5
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect! then i re-ordered and i got what i think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold, so i just ended up with two dozen wasted picks. so just make sure you get the right one.12.5.11 update: okay, so i just realized that there are "dunlop stubby picks" and then there are "dunlop big stubby picks" sorry... 5
i have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years. i have found no major issues with any of them. expect to do a small amount of fretwork, such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends, checking the frets for crowns, filing those down and polishing the frets. as with any neck, even the high dollar ones, the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up. they come unfinished but well sanded. i sand a bit extra, but one could spray it out of the box. i like to use 3 coats of amber and 6 to 9 coats of clear lacquer, satin or semi gloss. none of these are select quarter sawn wood, but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument. 5
i've owned loop stations, dm-4s, jam mans, samplers and all that jazz. they're all full of crap you dont need. this pedal has flawless, colorless sound quality. it records what you sound like. you click it on, record your riff, click it and listen to it loop. tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over. you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers. smallest, cheapest, easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find. if you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use, then dont get this one, but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the dm-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this. 5
simple, easy to use tuner, awesome price, works on guitars and basses, i am very happy with this product, very portable too 5
works well, has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options.  i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb. 5
great for beginners and experts. the sound is great and is easy on the fingers.  i got them recommended by a friend 5
i use this cable for small home recording projects. i do not take the cable around to gigs or shows, as i am pretty sure it wouldn't last longer than a few months of heavy use. the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy. if your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job, this is your product. 4
this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use. it's easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone. it's easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not. the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes. 5
i had a hard time lineing them up to install .the little knob on them made it very hard to install.so good luck .. 3
just received the cable, it sounds clear, doesn't feel like it is made of the best materials, i just got this cable today so i can't really comment on how durable it is and how long it will last, so far i tend to believe it is a decent cable for the price, i don't use a microphone very often so this cable should last a while. so far it is working well, i would buy another one if i needed it, the price is right, 3
great tuner for the price.makes tunning easy and fast.the grips come off the neck on my acoustic,but works better on my electric. 4
great for linking close-quarter effect pedals. no noise and very durable. great product for the price. i would recommend buying. 5
the 3-pack is a fantastic deal. i've been around mics under $100 for 30 years, and when compared to other mics in the $50-$100 range, they are as good or better! good lows and clean highs without any hiss. absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp. don't miss out on this great deal. 5
a inexpensive guitar stand that was easy to assemble (1 minute) and holds up well. very pleased with this purchase. 5
i always put my recorder on the stage on a mini tripod that would get kicked over by band members. now i put my recorder on my monitor mike stand and don't worry about it anymore. simplicity at its best. 5
great picks, buy it. this pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing. 5
i have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong.  i use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric.  great design.  i cant see how they could improve this at all. 5
i honestly don't see the purpose.  it doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar.  i've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.edit 5/30/13:after coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened:  this was shipped to me completely dry.  there was no grease/lubricant qualities.  it was like a dry erase pad.  they need to improve their quality control.  i'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star.  they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out. 1
these original bullets are great for my strat. they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect. the strings sound great and hold up to the &#34;whammy&#34; just fine. sound great and look great. 5
there are two ways guitar strings go bad. if you leave them on long enough, the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode- but that takes months, if not more. before that happens, grease from your fingers, dust, bits of skin, and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings, between the windings. this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound. back when strings were a lot more expensive, some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them; some bass players still do. coated strings are a simpler alternative.these strings and similar ones like elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings, which accomplishes two things: first, it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap, which prevents rust and corrosion. second, it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings. the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings. they do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings, but it's not a huge difference, and after a month or two they still sound the same.they also cost about twice as much as equivalent non-coated d'addarios. are they worth it? that depends. if you're an active performer, maybe. you're probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you're getting a bright sound. you're probably also buying your strings by the box. there's no real benefit to these strings. where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy. these days i'm strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year. i have four acoustic guitars, and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played. with coated strings, i can leave a set on a guitar, and a month or two later i can pull it out of the case and it's ready to play. i still change strings if i'm going to be playing in public, but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house, these are great. 5
having 250 feet of xlr - xlr (m-f) cables that can be used any way i want (e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo, 1 250 foot for mono, or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work) is very flexible.the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord (white) to store them when not in use.as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors, this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job.  i ended up using all 10 of the 25' cords for mics and amplified speakers, plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect.  you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters! 5
great starter uke. got this for my wife she just loves it. stays in tune. good sound.the price was right. 5
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam. i didn't run it without this power source, that seems too ghetto. they should just jack the price to what it would be with this and viola! but what do i know. 5
i recently changed them out for a different type of eb's while they were good the were not exactly what i was looking for. not sure the new set is either but time will tell. 4
well, i have another strap that looks like this one, but i can tell you that this is cheaper on the materials. anyway, it does what is supposed to do and i'm happy with it, i wasn't looking for anything expensive, but this works really good... if you want something to just practice with this is what  you should get. i recommend it! 3
wow, this works!  at first, i was a little wary about using the liquidthe original peg drops by ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product.  being my own bumbling teacher, there was a fear i could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument.  however, i needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs, so i closed my eyes and blundered ahead (that's just a figure of speech; for i was careful, using the stuff for the first time).  with care, cotton and a small rag (torn off my moth eaten underwear) i went ahead, willing to try anything.  i even removed the strings from the pegs (only one at a time - starting with the inner one first), put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string.  tuning then became a breeze.  to think i used up a great glob of practice time, not fiddling, but tuning.  bop! could'a had a veggie drink! 5
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time 5
so, first up:  i've been using macs to record music since the g4 cube... yeah, go look that up.  anyway, i know my way around audio recording on apple devices.and then: yeah, this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy...but: i haven't encountered anything so plug & play simple as the apogee jam 96k since gefen introduced the imic.  just plug in the usb or lightning cable, plug in your instrument and go.also, it's not flimsy.  it is made of plastic, but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk.it pulls power from your machine, so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings. this also helps those of us using electric guitars that don't have extra-wound humbuckers.i tested the apogee jam on a new (2014) macbook air, an iphone 5, and a 2013 ipad mini.  garageband instantly knew what was going on, but protools did need a bit of coaching.a small device that doesn't color input sound and doesn't get in the way... just what i needed! 5
well, the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning!am i impressed? u bet cha!this thing is simply beautiful! it arrived well padded in a double box. initially, i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws. none! not a finger print on it anywhere! this guitar is extremely well made and put together right. it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. the neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. i put a quarter under the 10th. fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!it's considerably heaver than than i thought.  i would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. i have a strap ordered and on the way.the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups. this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had.  your hand floats over the frets!i don't think you could get a better piece for the price point. 5
this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit "hive mind" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory. 2
i like purchasing the 3 pack because i have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings.  you can't beat the price.  i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way. 5
i chose this rating because a fine paper towel seems to work just as well as this microfiber polish cloth. 3
there are other rack screws out there, but raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available. 5
the base for this thing is a monster! the thing works great, and because of the very strong load the base provides - not the easiest thing to accidentally knock over. 5
monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. i initially purchased a pair ofmonster rock instrument cable - 21 feet - angled to straight 1/4-inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar i thought i'd pinch a few pennies.  i am so glad i did.i compared this cable model to the more expensive models i previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. i swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.what the more expensive model has going for it is looks. i am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. you may find, as i did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer. 5
i keep ordering more of these picks.  i love the rubber grip and the mediums are just the right thickness for me.  great product! 5
bought a couple of these to build pre-loaded pickguards for strats. they work just fine, nice solid feel, screws included, and white or black tips. there are two rows of connectors 5
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed). 1
duriong my lessons, my instructor talked about several models of tuners that a guitarist can get. some are old time one still with a kick, and the one he recommended was the snark. nor the shark, and that is what i thought he said when i first heard it. there were several kinds of tuners and i was looking for a good quality, made of sturdy materials, and was in a good price range. the snark i chose has been working just great for me. 5
not a lot of moving parts on this piece. lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body. 5
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place. easy to reach and nice to have on hand. 5
this tuner really delivers, its inexpensive and accurate , much better than the sn1. do not be fooled by the broader gradients on the sn 8, if you are in the green , you are in tune. sn 8 is also far more reliable, no notorious having to adjust the neck to get a reading as in the sn 1 and 2. i use mine with ukulele and guitars, and both get tuned accurately with it. 5
let me just start out by saying that i've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. i still own most of these units except for this one...the joyo compressor. my setup is a very simple one...starting with a stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. i don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i've tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them. this thing simply didn't work right out of the box. while the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from china. loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. i ended up sending it back for a full refund. i don't in anyway blame the seller. they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again...just nothing with the name joyo on it. if you're only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for. 1
this snark thing is the cats meow, its absolutely charlie. it hears things i don't and tells me whether they are what i want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together.if you like being in tune, this is probably for you. it is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything. you can clamp it on a cat's tail, but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don't even think about doing that you sicko.great design, easy to read, works better than 2 other brand tuners i own. only bummer is you can't carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one. if it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars, oh well.i suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool, hip, out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity.  oh the peer pressure........ 5
i can now say i have used several others - coated martins, flat wounds, smooth wounds, exp, elixir, etc. these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks. their tone is slightly bright but not as &#34;harpsichord&#34; as the exp. i am done experimenting. these are the strings for takamine guitars. 5
this product is great. you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals. read the description so you can have a sense of size. tue quality is very nice, solid and resistible. the soft case is very nice also. 5
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic.  would need a heavier base for use with a boom. 4
i like this almost as well as the ernie ball alternative i've been using for 20+ years with shaler strap locks.these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently. you may or may not love the details but they work just fine and to me are extremely comfortable. 4
fast delivery, and exactly as advertised.  put it to work making music within minutes.  the steel gives a clearer sound than the glass  bottle slides,  but you need both.  good product. 5
my son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass (jazz band) and his standup bass (chamber orchestra). it is solid, yet flexible in height and angle. assembly was a breeze. this is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use. built like a tank. should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family. 5
there is a problem with the design.  when you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off.  the tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes. 1
i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq. i did have to sand to make it fit. that may sound badm but i am glad because it's better than too small. i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering. 5
i don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.  this one surpassed my expectations.months into using the gig bag and not a single problem.  the pockets are packed with books, tools, and strings.the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze. 5
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought.  wow almost like the opposite it is like a violin sound or mock reverse single delay sound.  gotta love the slow moe 5
i bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs, the same heads i bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven't torn. these heads are amazing and a very good investment. make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death. definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads 5
ok, so i just installed these things for my krk 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  what can i say?  the bass, which previously had disappeared in my studio, is now present again!  my monitors sounded kinda thin before because i was losing so much energy to my desk, but these things have made a ton of difference!  my stereo image even feels wider now!sure, they're a little pricy, but hey...they work!  if that's what they want to charge for them, and people continue to buy them, i'm cool with that!  i'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5! 5
i have been fortunate to build a small, but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music. all 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years i've been using string swings i've never had a problem with them. they hold every guitar, regardless of neck shape or style. since they swivel, my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks. the depth is adjustable, so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics. while i never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my nitro coated guitars, i didn't want to take a chance, so i use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar's finish. i try and screw them into studs to support the weight, and where i can't do it, i hang some of my lighter guitars, but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure... although i sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens. i also strongly recommend (as others have done) that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars (40-50% humidity is perfect). i recommend the honeywellhoneywell hcm-6009 quietcare 9-gallon output console humidifier with air washing technology 5
another great roland product.  really easy to use and well built .... very good sound.  great for practice.  certainly do not get the rc 2  ... get this rc 3 model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later...i did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big... check for sales or demos 4
this is the first harmonica i ever used. i did some research and ended up with the special 20 in the key of c. i have no basis for comparison and i am a beginner but this instrument sounds awesome! the construction is perfect and the included case is very appreciated : ) for $25 i can't complain! 5
i got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. that is a record. the tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. it is the sound that i like though. 5
does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating 5
simple and useful rack stand. easy to assemble. easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality. 3
this levy's jacquard strap is well made and comfortable. it was much cheaper here than any other place on-line or at a brick and mortar. arrived quite quickly, but a tracking number would've been nice. otherwise, no compaints. 5
recommend this to anyone!we have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive.  i believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand. 5
fine strings that i have been using for a very long time of my electric guitars. you can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings. 5
d'addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as i can remember.  this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars. 5
if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button, these are great buttons to use.  it comes with two buttons, two washers and 4 screws (two different sizes). 5
i tried this model a few years ago, and i never had a problem with them (once i got it installed), but i went back to the schallers i had on my other instruments.  i thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which i thought looked goofy.  i also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a c clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. i also felt safer with the schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  as i said, i had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.  as with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you. 4
the best eb slinky's i've ever used. on these i use the light's--9's. even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well. i use them on all 4 of my guitar's. two fender american standard's, gibson es-335. gibson les paul/ with bigsby. i always have a set in each case..... try'um... ya won't regret it !!!!! 5
d'addario strings have never failed me. these are so much better than the other nylon strings i used to buy where the ball end always broke. these strings sound nice and you can't go wrong with the price tag either. 5
it came and it wasn't broken or bad and it held my brother's guitar for a few years until he sold it 5
this pick holder is pretty awesome. it's nice to have a place for picks on the guitar. if you're anything like me i always keep a pick in the strings up by the neck of the guitar. not anymore! they now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar!!! 5
i really like the foot-switch. seems well made for the price and works as advertised. i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd. 4
how many times did i tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided i didn't need chorus at all. this pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. i even like it with the bass. just a great chorus with not much to tweak. 5
i have an esp guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when i got the guitar. after buying a line-6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag.found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear, cables, etc. i originally put it on my wish list because i will admit, you don't always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise.my guitar fits perfectly. it used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut. as mentioned, the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close.but this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag. and the pockets - oh the pockets! they fit all of my gear. i have my guitar cable, a set of full size sennheiser headphones, a line 6 pocket pod, all the allen wrenches, a tuner, and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets. and there is room for more if i need it!the bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn't stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned. just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two.one last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock. i did not know this but wow i had no idea how useful that could be. i tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful. then you have the backpack handles as an option as well. i really cannot recommend this bag enough. i do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but i don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, i would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel. it would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing. i don't travel long distances with my guitar but if i did, i would use a hard case only for that as i have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately.hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear! 5
it's very small.  it's a fabric stretchy capo, the old type, that's quite difficult to stretch and make stay.  it's made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo, but the end isn't very long and i don't trust it to stay while playing for long.  i'll keep it as a spare, just in case, anyway. 3
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great. never an issue. no loss of tone. never breaks or fails. quality product for a good price. 5
great little amp. i had to take my ampeg jet in for a maintenance and i just love this little practice amp. i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker. 5
to everyone who plays flat-picking guitar, i'm sure you all have your own choice of pick....do you even remember why you picked the style you use!? somehow, i started out with fender thins and here i remain! 5
the threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin, but it's still a great strap and holds up solidly. would certainly buy again. 4
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable. i have to take my glasses off when i use them, but other than that exactly what i thought they'd be when i ordered them. 4
rugged pedal by a little known company. took a shot in the dark, hit a bullseye! great univibeish/old chorus device. would like to see stereo output options in future models. solid. if you have a strat, have studied jimi, then it will suit you well if you've got the right physical approach to the guitar itself. 5
this might be a really, really nice stand, but the one i received was defective-one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won't attach, so i have to return it for a refund.  i'll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it's intact this time. 3
if you're in the need for a guitar capo, then this is a pretty good offering. for it being pretty cheap, i had to get it. shipping was fairly fast, and it's ready to use straight out of the package. :d 5
i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar.it works perfectly.super stable and doesnt take up much space.for the price i don't think it can be beat. 5
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.so far, works well.sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. can tune up quickly every time. 5
if you want u2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound. thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob. for the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget. 4
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano. if it can tune that, it should handle your guitar or bass fine. was really impressed to see it in action. not the smoothest operation in the world but it's gig-bag small and accurate. 5
great strings, deep rich tones from both highs and lows, a very good value for the dollar and customer service is second to none 4
for an $8 item, you can't go wrong. i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center. it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone. 5
if you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal i had a boss ds 1 and metal zone mt 2 and did not like them much because they're so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me. it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you're looking for then this is for you. it offers rugged construction and true bypass. the only problem i have had is that unity gain is at around 9 o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone. 5
lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.can't ask for much more in a tuner. 5
the strings definitely have a good tone, though i've got them on a low-end mandolin. they may be more than the mando needs. but they sound great! 5
i've never really owned a fuzz pedal before, but have tried a few. out of most i've tried, i've come across the big muff the most. it didn't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently. even my boss hyper metal hm-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks, but it isn't 100% there, certainly.my budget being what is it right now, i didn't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal. there are loads of fuzzes available for $100 or less, but this model is essentially three pedals in one. that's what attracted me to it, along with a few reviews in youtube. not to mention the bargain basement price.the three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal. the two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless.fuzz 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound. it doesn't get too bright, until the treble knob is pushed past 3 o' clock. this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick. with humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock. i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay. it seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes. if you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible.fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff. it has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister. with the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here. this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1, so it buzzes longer. this makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy. (head era korn comes to mind for me...)the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile. boost. this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level. it actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the eq and gain knobs all the way up. the resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked). still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, boost does a good job of staying clean. this would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound. it might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.overall, i like the tones this pedal spits out. i've only had it a few hours, but i love what i'm hearing so far. the build is similar to the other behringer pedals i have, a nr100 noise reducer, and a to800, their overdrive that sounds like a tube screamer. with this more recent pedal (built on june of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before. i'd still not abuse them too much, though. as always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank).you can't go wrong with the bright blue led, either! makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color. 4
it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand. it is very solid and will last a long time. 5
what a great little stand. i love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings. i also like the fact it folds up, taking up very little space when its stored away. the rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic, so there's no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck. 5
it's survived my clumsiness and i can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat. 4
comes in a really nice case.  works great.  great price. very light.  can't speak to durability because haven't had them long and haven't used them heavily. 5
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and it's awesome. real cost saver on batteries. you really cant go wrong for the price. 5
i bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar.since the peddle board is right in front of me, the coiled nature of the cord keeps me from getting tangled up.what surprised me was how it improved the sound? i hadn't thought that a cable would do this but i've since been told that i'm not the only player that has noticed this phenomena. it's beyond me how this works but i can hear the difference so, i'm changing over to all coiled cords. 5
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it. they really help me out and they are a cheap price. 5
i have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups. some peope miss the &#34;quack&#34; ,electric guitar type sound from these other types. i do not. i also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified ,nor is any battery required. i run it through a baggs para-acoustic preamp or my fishman aura.it really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly.product was delivered safely and promptly. 4
this stand easily folds, and holds my mandolin in a scratch-proof stance.  not good for smaller instruments, like the name may imply to some.  an attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed, but everything from tenor uke and up, did just fine! :) 5
good quality for my casual use.  i wouldn't use it on stage because of stability or weight related issues, it's too light. 4
i bought one of snark's "super tight" tuners and found it to be less then advertised. it will get you in tune, but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less. i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio, and one on my stage rig. buy it. it's a great little tuner! 5
i bought the wall mounts for a more permanent solution, but this lightweight little stand is sturdy and adjustable. i just move it around the house wherever i feel like playing. fold it up to take with me when i go out of town. everyone who sees it loves it. 5
this is an interesting, limited effect pedal. i bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. on a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. however, i play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.this pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. it's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. i combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.i tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. for chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. i haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as i normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well. 4
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked.  they don't play at all like what i was expecting.  under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old jazz iii either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  what's up with that?i'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop.  let's hope this is just a short-term fluke. 2
dunlop always makes top-notch products, so when it came time to find a slide, i knew where to look. this one produces a great tone, and is well-made. like the other reviewers mention here, you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits. for general home use though, i wouldn't worry about it too much though. 4
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length.. about the same tension as 9s on a strat.so, don't want 9s, and 10s too tight then 9.5s it is.. nice strings 5
i love the snark tuners but don't know that i'd call it super tight or faster than the older sn-2. i feel the display is an improvement - easy on the eyes. hopefully, more reliable than sn-2. i've had pixels dropping out on one sn-2 that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine. too soon to tell if the sn-8 will hang in there.i don't see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an sg. don't know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat. response time on the sg is longer than the older sn-2 model but, i haven't yet tried to understand what's going on with it. have't tried it on bass yet but, i know that the sn-2 didn't play well with the e string open. no big deal, i just tune it at 12th fret. could choose any note since it's chromatic. speaking of which, playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the snark. tune any string to match the song and then, tune the other strings with the same displayed error.bottom line is that it's a great tuner and it's not likely that i'll get much use out of the old korg tuner that once balanced on my knee. 4
i love it and there are a lot of bold type enhancements to my acoustic now.... the chicken picken' is much fun and i am still experimenting. as with all digitech pedals,  i just seem to love their ease of operation.  the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible.... 5
i cannot shower enough praise on the lpb-1. it currently sells for about $40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal (especially overdrive/distortion pedals) or on its own. i keep it on all the time, since it always improves sound-quality. 5
i ordered this as a spare and at this time, i haven't used it.  my microphone came with it's own cable and this was for a &#34;what if&#34; situation.  i gave it 4 stars on just expectation. 4
nice design... small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. i am thinking about getting a 2nd one. 5
the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools.  this stand is durable, firm and easy to assemble. 4
what a great little gizmo. i play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me. no more unplugging/plugging in-between songs. just a push on the pedal and i'm switching noiselessly between guitars. i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well. 5
ok reviewing something's i just don't see the need. ok that being said , i searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedals...this came up first and is imo all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons. i dont know what else to say..... the cord isn't very long but not overly short either, i have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc. ok for now that's all i got, i may edit later on down the line. 5
i'm a beginner harmonica player, and this was perfect for me! i am able to practice with it easily, and it didn't cost me a fortune as some of the more professional harmonicas are. 5
i've been playing guitar for years and personally i would prefer cleartone or elixir strings. i bought these for my little sister and she loves them. they have a really nice sound to them. i feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these. 4
first off, i'm no ukulele expert. that being said: i replaced the original strings on my newmahalo u-35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pinkwith these. i know they stated concert, however, reading up on this, they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings. like another reviewer said, it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke, but it sure helped out a lot. the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. i'm loving the sound. also, i really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  i would definitely recommend these. 4
i can't speak on the claim for a longer string life.  the strings are true to elixir's quality and tone.  these strings sound great plug and unplugged.  i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too.  there are tonal differences as expected.  the 80/20 are brighter, but the tones are clear and crisp.  when amplified, i did note less finger noise as i re-positioned or slid my fingers along the strings.  i didn't notice any difference to the feel of the string...as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years.  time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions.  for now, even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb ... you're still getting a good deal. 5
heavy duty, pretty sturdy, finish is not the best in the world but it certainly does the job it was intended for, holds secure and adjusts easily 4
what an amazing product. multi-voltage capability for worldwide use, powering eight pedals, and very cost effective, too. if i bought eight adapters, it would cost me well over $120 usd. even at the price it's sold at, the build quality is pro level. i'd be happy using this on a well-traveled pedalboard. at this price, you could buy two or three of these packs to power huge boards.i usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session. not all at once, but it's nice to know that the delivery is smooth, without any drops or spikes in power level. i can crank 'em all if i want to, and go nuts. 5
i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  this one is the worst.  the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  after twisting on it twice i stripped it out.  now the thing is worthless.  i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6" pop filter.  if you don't, you'll wish you did. 1
80/20 strings "blend" really well on my cheap jasmine guitar. they improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit. phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine. 80/20 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out. they did nothing to help my over-braced 1970 gibson j-50, though. phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap. 5
bought two sets. both arrived together and at the expected delivery date. i had bought two sets of the pyle pro pmdk102 months previously which also included a pair of 25ft 1/4" cabling from an amazon dealer which arrived without problems. initially, i noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles. personally, i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103. later comparison showed that the pstk103 is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker pole.however, the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products. the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs. there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing. why i blame the manufacturer's packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple ... the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and side-by-side within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton, no other fore-thought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded. really, how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foam?!!!on the plus side ... after testing each of the tripod stands ... all seemed to function perfectly well. the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up. the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved ... i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy. only time and after some use hereafter will i be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain. 3
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today. sure, some are said to be the best at this or that, but for me the rat is the one that does it all. and at a great price to boot. this pedal is not new to me. i've had a few of them in the past, but the rat 2 is just a great as the older "vintage" models. goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer, to a near fuzztone, with some warm, smooth creamy tones in between. remarkable. no other distortion pedal can do it as well. i've been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them. but the rat delivers. no joke. it just does it all, and well.the filter (tone) is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise. that might thow a few folks off, but it's a little thing really. the filter is the core of it's tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion. by going higher with the distortion control, the volume only goes up a little. that's great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit, the volume won't go through the roof.100% silent switching. no hum. no buzz. and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit. flawless comes to mind here. easy to set up. strong as a tiger tank. and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with. and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past. kinda cool if you ask me.if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues, get yourself a rat. if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a "boo-teek" pedal that sits in the rat's shadow, buy that high dollar unit and you can at least "look good" while you play. but your tone will still stink. its up to you. me? its a no brainer. i go with the rat.... 5
i gave it five stars! i purchased this for my young son but i find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does.  i wanted something flexible and decided to buy the mustang iii over the ii because of the power and the larger speaker.i've read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what i think about the amp. it sounds great and it has loads of power.  since it's solid-state, it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end, but for this price?!? wow! i have no complaints.one thing most have failed to mention is the non-amp features like the input for an mp3 player and the fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones, creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes. both mac and windows are supported. my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively. since he's 11, he doesn't have many opportunities to play with others. he can create jam/click tracks and play along. we also downloaded new firmware from fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions.people who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks, then upload them to fender's user web site. we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired. he wanted a tone that sounded like his. we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people.  one of them was particularly great. we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it.  he loves it.great amp. i can't compare to line 6 but i can compare it to other amps i've heard. it's pretty nice.  equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of $$$ on fx. 5
my les paul is heavy.. the strap would constantly fall off. so i decided to get a set of strap locks. these installed in minutes, and really dont change the look of the guitar at all. you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap. if you dont have locks on all your guitars, you cant interchange your straps easily any more, so i recommend getting them for all your guitars. the other added benefit i found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back. with these locks the strap sits away from the guitar, so it fixes that problem as well. when i buy a new guitar, i get new locks. are there better locks out there? i'm not sure, but im committed now as i wanted the same locks on all my guitars.. has never failed me yet. 5
i am 65 years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months.  as you can imagine, i need to practice a lot!  my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing...especially when i practice monotonous scales.i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor's web site.  i love it!  easy to put on and take off. the rubber won't hurt your violin, bridge or strings. you can barely hear it in the next room.  you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge.  my violin's tone doesn't change much at all with this mute.now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me! 5
i bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... this is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it. 5
these knobs arrived in perfect condition, the correct color and fit my stratocaster remake well. you can't necessarily go wrong with knobs. i like the black look to my guitar now. 5
if you're worried that the 3.0 mm is too big for your guitar, you're probably right.if you don't use a pick for your bass, then you don't want this either.but if you want to pick your bass, this is the plectrum for you! 5
if you have never recorded vocals with a pop filter you don't know what you are missing. this one works well, gets rid of a lot of the little sounds and all the pops. only bad thing is when it doesnt stay in place, but its usually fine 4
i don't play with a guitar below my waist. i am six feet tall. while very well made, wide, comfortable and good looking, this sling was far too short and had to be returned. 3
i was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my fender beginner's mandolin set, worried i'd permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them. having a dozen similar--a few for me and a few to share--meets the need! he heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice, especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks. 4
no way this thing cost lest than $40.  i needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so i gave the joyo pedals a try and i am pleasently surprised.  this compares to my other compression pedals i own...in a metal case???? bonus.  i'm super happy with my joyo pedals. 5
works exceedingly well for any use. whether dubbing audio, recording instruments, or just yelling at the top of your lungs. no issues and pretty sure i will never have any. 5
these are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks.  thus, just a heads-up.  having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks.  i use all types and all brands and fender's are always predictably great quality. 5
i play in our band at church and as such, i've been wanting a vox ac15 for quite some time.  for those of you who do not play contemporary christian music and are wondering what the heck i'm talking about, let's just say that it's an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music, you must utilize a vox tone.  because of u2.  i know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it.anyway, for the past few years i've been utilizing a line 6 floor pod plus to achieve this tone.  i've been using the "class a" sound, which is close, and quite useable, but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and i've never found a way around that.  i just sort of dealt with it.  then came father's day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used vox ac15c1 and i love everything about it.  doing a little research, it seems that its predecessor (ac15cc1) was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners.  well, the ac15c1 implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that's awesome right out of the box.  i've seen some people complain about the fact that it's a pcb inside and not hand-wired, and that it's made in china.  so what.  it sounds very nice, especially for the low price.the amp's overdrive is very rich, with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume.  i cranked it to 10 in my living room and was quire loud for a 15w amp, but not window-shattering loud.  in a church setting this is obviously not an option.  fortunately, you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy vox tone, just at a more manageable level.  you need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the "top boost" and "normal" channels.  i've opted to just use the "normal" channel and push it with a joyo ultimate drive pedal, which by the way, is the most impressive $40 overdrive pedal you'll ever hear.  that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all.  i used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with dimarzio hs series pickups and the joyo pedal pushing the amp, and it was classic vox chime all the way.  i also used a boss dd-5 delay (also required if you play in a christian band - same reason as the other thing i mentioned...)  pure tone heaven.some have noted noise or "hiss" problems with this amp, which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes.  mine did not have this problem.  actually, i thought it did, and i was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before i realized that it was the way i had the amp set up:  as i stated earlier, this is a 2-channel amp (normal and top boost), but which one you're using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into.  i was plugged into the normal channel, and didn't realize that the top boost volume was dimed and that's where the hiss was coming from.  i just shut that volume completely off since i was not using the top boost channel anyway.  problem solved.i'm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice.  i've owned marshalls, mesa/boogies, a laney, a music man, and other oddball tube amps over the years, some costing several times the cost of the vox ac15c1 and the vox can hold its own with those others.  think of it as an affordable "boutique amp".  if you can pick one up used like i did, all the better.  interestingly enough, this amp was advertized as a used vox ac15 with no indication of whether it was a c1 or a cc1.  fortunately it was a c1.  it's a value at full price also.  get one. 5
this is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] it's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of boss pedals. further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (note: it comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does not come with a power source/adapter.) if the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo. this also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the boss product; it's still quite good, but the boss takes the prize. i paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets. 5
they are half the size of a regular pick.  bit too thick for me.  sound nice. will last forever. wish i had sized them before i bought them. 3
this was for a friend who needed a guitar capo. he hasn't had any problem with the capo yet. and the price was right. 5
it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor.  i don't trust it and amazon has it way over priced.  it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place. 2
got a cleaner/polish/wax type ointment for every part of your guitar. comes with a small rag, and fret polishing pad deal....the fret pad is great and i didn't know about this type of thing till getting this kit. also comes with a step by step/stage by stage instruction pamphlet. worth it to get this kit and replace /add to it as needed. 5
i like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments- i run this through a furman pedal board and there is little to no noise - for the money this is a good product- 5
i read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie-device. working just fine so far, came quickly in the mail. 5
no lie, these are the perfect strings for an electric arch-top.smooth but not dull sounding. will defiantly be buying more. 5
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own.  i am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but i use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable.  not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model.  worth the wait. 5
this is an good stand for situations where there aren't too many threats to your guitar (running dogs on the porch, reeling drunks at a bar). get a heavier stand or a wall hanger if you have a fabulous vintage martin or a handmade henderson. overall, well worth the price. 4
my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions.  this is the neatest little light i have ever seen.  it takes 3 aaa batteries (included- but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out). and has 2 nice leds.  the lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music.  the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand.  battery life so far has been at least 8 hours (actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also).  i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable.  a real needed item is you play in darker rooms. 5
i gave it 4 stars because it is well made and it does the job it is designed to do. but i personally do not like how it looks of it when installed. but that is only a personal opinion. you may see it differently. don't use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase. it does what it was made to do. i purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap. 4
these little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..i'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. the product description says 6 inches, right? if you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b001pgxkc8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=utf8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) the hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up.to conclude, would i recommend these? yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else. 4
i put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time. great strings and great value 5
this tuner tunes my guitars very well, it tunes them perfectly, and works well tuning bass guitar, very easy to use, very visible screen when tuning, clamps on nicely, and the red color is very beautiful you could say, all in all very good tuner. 5
bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law. gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick. he loved them. still has some. 5
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk. imports often have threads other than 1/4 inch sae. it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads. quick install, works like a dream. 5
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp...do yourself a favor, always order threw amazon dealers! i placed an order threw onlinecarstereo.com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co....their customer reviews were terrible, yet i made the mistake of placing n order...right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones.... 5
i will just say that in my opinion, if you are looking for something to take your taylor to a gig in, you are better served with an skb. in a sense, the case should mirror the guitar it will hold. however, all that being said, this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars. it is well crafted and cheap. i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric. a nice guitar, but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two. anyway, i also store some extra picks, my strap, and a couple cords in the bag (along with a fretboard cloth, a set of strings, a tuner, and an allen wrench for the truss rod). all in all, great value for a good item. 5
this is a really nice product for the price.  when fully extended, it becomes a little tippy, but i don't fully extend the legs which gives it a wider, more stable base.  otherwise, it folds up nice and small for travel.  nice product! 4
can't hold tightly on 1st string (low c), a little buzz. 2
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves!!! the heavy bottons 32, 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone. the others, 10, 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also. i don't rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci. when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection. the high strings were plenty of flakes. if fender solved that it would be perfect. 4
i am a fan of joyo-  i own the vintage od, the ultimate drive, the sweet baby, the us dream,  the crunchbox clone, and this one.  this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal.  i'm giving it 3 stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap, but the octive leaves much to be desired.  i have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue.  apparently, one of the components is installed in a reversed positon, which results in the lackluster octive.  i haven't taken mine apart for the fix, but i read that it's just unsolder, flip, and resolder the same component.  you can google it for better instructions.  still, this ain't bad for the pocket change they charge.  the reason i haven't fixed it yet is i have the feeling that once i mod it, it will sound just like my dano french toast- albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass- 3
i use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over. its worked great. very happy with it. its not a $2000 quality mic but it its a good mic for the money. some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes, but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter. 5
i use this pair of mics mostly to record a piano in xy configurationpros:-price point-sturdy, good construction-included accessories (carrying case, clips, stereo bar)cons:-have to adjust the gain just right on a mixer preamp to avoid noise 4
i started out wilth balls when i first picked up the guitar in 1968 when i was 17. they were worth my part time minimum wage money and gave me what i wanted. a very reliable product that took me through the transition from an amateur to a professional lead guitarist. i highly recommend them. keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag! 5
i cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after i received the product. the cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator. the fretboard turned out nicely though so i decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3. i have to say though that i believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn't a bad buy. just remember it isn't recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one. 4
i like the picks a lot! they are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! recommended 5
i've only recently heard of joyo pedals, and that's because amazon.com kept recommending them to me.  i normally stick with boss pedals - they sound good, and they're all the same size, so they're easy to set up/maintain.  this pedal was priced very well ($32), and had nearly a 5 star rating.  i used to have a boss phaser (i don't recall which number off the top of my head.)  it was a pretty complex little pedal, and sounded great, but i needed money and sold it.  when i saw this pop up in my amazon, i got curious, did some research, and decided it would be a wise investment.  sure enough, it was!  it's obviously simple to use, having one knob and all.  over all, the pedal sounds great, and seems to be very well made.  based on this experience, i'm very much interested in checking out their chorus, flanger and overdrive pedals.i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive, simple yet well-made and great sounding phaser! 5
it's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from, very good value at only $10 not counting shipping, very satisfied. 5
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb. still a great guitar string. a real winner for elixir who are the originators of &#34;goretex&#34; a real triumph of re-invention. well done goretex! 5
i've had this pedal for a number of years. it provides a wide range of reverb effects, sounds natural and has a killer stereo output. i've haven't heard a pedal that competes with spring reverb, but this pedal keeps up with any simulated reverb pedal i've heard and does an excellent job with amps that lack a spring unit. the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well. recommended. 5
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar. it sounds good and looks really nice. i get compliments on it. 5
i bought these to try them out. i have used remo a little then i used to have some aquarian heads and wanted to try evans to see how they are. amazing. i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up. my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them. 5
awesome cheap repalcement string i would recommend them to anyone who doesnt want to spend 50 bucks on high quality strings 5
i purchased these for my little pedal board "the stepping stone".these are very well made with the heads well secured. the plastic is thick and of a nice material.the cables come with a massive 5 year warranty so i'm sure they're not going bad anytime soon.buy with confidence. 5
i'm pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years. (i haven't found a wireless unit that i feel comfortable with on stage yet) i was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until i purchased these. at first i purchased one just to check them out, but after six months. i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these. there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too. they last forever! definitely worth the money! 5
a little small for my taste, very thin, but works well and dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician. 3
holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar 5
i am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings. this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard .... and even my bass. the cd input has no controls but is a very useful feature just the same. having behringer mics and a ub802 mixer, i banked on this being a good amp and was not disappointed. the 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument. no 15-watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings.... and do not expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you. every musician should have one of these around. money well spent! 5
depends on what your looking for. is this a pog...nope, but it has some tricks up it's leave for the price. the only con i can give is when playing chords when dropping down (like a drop d) it doesn't always sound grant. bar chords work a little better 5
it's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. it sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height! 5
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them.  nice and stable, easy to change strings and lock tightly.  always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing. to note these have the two peg placement anchors on them, so if your headstock only has the single hole for the tuning peg, you will have to do some drilling. really nice upgrade for your standard tuners. 5
is a nice cable,,god quality  as always with the fender brand... guys if you need a cable that are not high budget,, and a god quality this is the cable.... 5
take some time but it was well worth it.  i've always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards.  this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before! 5
what's not to love about these strings? the sound is fantastic ... they ring like they should. but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long. 5
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended 5
not quite as good as the red all instrument snark, but it gets the job done and the price is right. 4
accurate little accessory only works with guitars. it seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with. only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar. i don't know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments, or for uses other than tuning. 5
with this power supply you can offer to your pedals 9vdc, 12vdc, 18vd or 12vac. i'm using 8 pedals conected to this power supply, and i don't have any kind of noise or hum. 5
every guitar i've ever cared about has had this strap on it. i must've bought about 10 of these over my lifetime, and i don't regret it even in the slightest. 5
i was happy it was made in the usa but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs. might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn't done by shipping. 3
i have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is great. as a matter of fact, i ordered 2 more. get this one and have no regrets........ 5
this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable. 5
what you need to know about this mic:1) this mic is very directional. you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results. pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect. i found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best. as long as i keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i'm in. also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose. aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal. right at the upper lip works well for me.2) the bass cut and presence boost are convenient. use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it. i've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best. initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids. flat's where it's at. flat sounds most natural.3) being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might. though it takes eq well, and you can eq that in. if you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you. after using it for a few years, i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm7b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem. whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either.4) yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so. it rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive. so if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up. so don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one. hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set. being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix.5) so what does it sound like? the sound is *very* natural and true to my voice. it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost. that plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points. it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds. it does have slight color in the mids; i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900hz, slight boost 1000-2000hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that. the color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range. that's one reason why this mic is considered "flattering" on vocals. it still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic.6) this thing is heavy and rugged. the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides. the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors. what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do. so it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts. even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down.7) this mic needs 50 db gain for loud singing, 55-60db for quiet singing, 65-70db for whispering. make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60db of clean gain. some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to 35db. if your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a cloudlifter and it'll add 25db of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too.overall, i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one. but since my room isn't perfect, this will do. the biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix. it's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the sm7b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.in the end, if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the sm7b. mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results.edit 2014:  forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the sm7b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser. this is a problem because the sm7b's diaphragm is actually back a few inches. so the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the sm7b in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color. in shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the sm7b sounds like a good condenser. it really does. of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as i said below you can *easily* eq that in, since this mic takes eq very well. seriously, a 2db shelf in the highs. another thing i wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can eq that down a bit. and finally, when shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it. yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest. 5
when i look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables, so bright and festive, i just feel beautiful all over again. 4
great recorder on so many levels.i use it for external audio recording for dslr video.i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics.dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible.not intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functions.something i will have to get used to. 4
but didnt work on the el cheapo drop in pickguard/pickup setup that i got here on amazon. other than that, they look cool in the package. loli suppose this gives me a reason to build a whole other guitar just to use these covers. ahahahahahahyeah, thats right.... 4
i've never had a problem with these patch cables. i'm running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out.one thing that is important to note is that i'm not hard on my gear. i'm a home noodler, so i can't say if these patches can take road/stage abuse and lots of setup/tear-down cycles. they seem pretty buff and capable, but i can only report what i've experienced. 5
for the price they are awesome strings.... i like the sound(i like a little heavier sound), and i'm hoping the high e will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge &#34;its always the first to go&#34;. you cant beat the price on amazon i paid 9.50 at my music store but i needed strings asap, i will order back ups at this price. 5
i had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so i had to get another for my acoustic. super simple to install and very sturdy once installed. 5
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money. but all in all works well. good display and very easy to use. 4
i gave this product 5 stars , simply because it did exactly what i bought it to do - reduce unwanted noise to my amp. you will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to. it doesn't cut noise while your playing , but when your not it comes on a kills the noise. there are two lights on the pedal, one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise. if you have it set to high or to sensitive , it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise . so play with it and find your personal setting because i'm sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp. the nr300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you , you will be happy with it. oh, and if you switch it to mute, it works as an on and off switch.. you also can not beat the price---- 5
i use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars, except for the smaller takamine new yorker and a&l; ami (i use the d'addario custom lights).  i have grown a fondness for the phosphor bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking.  also, the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys i've tried, such as martins and elixirs.  these strings are quite durable and long-lasting.  in the 10 years i've been playing, i've never had these strings break on me (i've broken martin and elixir strings in the past).  the color-coded end balls help with the restringing.  i typically get the three-pack so i can restring a trio set of my herd at a time.  i really can't complain about anything.the individual gauges are: .012, .016, .024w, .032w, .042w, .053whighly recommended. 5
i have yet to install this neck, but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect. there is little to no evidence of corners being cut, just to start. materials and labor all look good to great. measuring for fit and specifications is on the money. not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most &#34;econo necks&#34; seem to be off by at least 1/8.&#34; i'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill. frets look good, and nut looks good. until i can install it, i can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.long story short is this neck looks better than many i've had that cost 2x as much, or more. unless it has a twist or hump, it actually earns the 5th star. even if the frets need a little cleanup, it still earns the 5th star. while some may not like the flatter radius, i'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren't as much of an issue. and it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish, but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all. so again, another reason for the 5th star. 4
wuhan makes great products for the money. i have the 18&#34; medium crash and so i decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck. if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the 60's or 70's. nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals,  with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash. will review each one as they come in from amazon. why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like i am, go for wuhans. i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash. wuhan really impresses me. there are some great video's of wuhans on you tube, you should really check those out before buying wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter. i am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash! 4
a very boring, dull, uninspiring pedal. don't waste your time with this. a boss sd-1 or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range. 2
i really don't see how gibson can make and sell these for $99!  the tech at the guitar shop can't see how either.  i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects.  i was really surprised to see how well they sounded.  i'm not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy/experiment for me.  if you are really into electric sound, i recommend going the guitar route.  if you just want to play around a little, this uke will do. 5
they upgraded my 72 tele deluxe, they fit perfectly yet you have to push really hard on the finish at the headstock for it to go in without opening any holes on the wood. 5
so these are  pretty great strings. not much to say. the price is really good. about ten dollars a set which is really good. 4
got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my m-audio profire 2626 to control midi in pro tools. works great! firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility. 5
this audio adapter works perfectly.  why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio.  i'm able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers. 5
does a good job polishing my strat after playing, reasonably priced, definitely something to keep around if you play your guitar regularly! 4
is this guraunteed for life or something?  it should be for the price.  it is very basic, tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up.  i would not buy another one at the prices they charge, but then, i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to.  the carry bag is very nice, the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff.  they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it, they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between.  if you look at the picture there appears to room for 6 pedals but 5 is all you will get.  i have a boss rx-20 double pedal looper, and 2 other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables. 3
i've been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel.  i got these from the vine, and wow, they are awesome.  they cost no more than the strings i normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different.  i can't comment on how long they'll last or keep in tune..but for now, i'm impressed.  i'll probably keep using these on my santana prs for awhile since i like the sound.  every once in awhile, i'll step outside of my box...i mean.. i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them.  i use d'addario on my acoustic guitars, and ernie balls on my electrics..except for my strat..i like fender bullets on it.  so the sample from the vine...sorta of nudged me..and i'm the better for it. 5
i got this after seeing many of my church friends using them.  i got this one so i could use it to tune my guitars a ukulele and a violin.  it does all of them well.  i'm going to buy a couple more as gifts. 5
i am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far i get a big punch aout of it . i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine. i am running a dj karaoke system. i also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable. item received looks diferent i say better. 5
this is a great guitar for the money. i paid $69.34 for my guitar and bought it through amazon.com from streamline audio video. it arrived ahead of schedule in great shape, ready to play right out of the box (after tuning it of course). if you want a better guitar than this, you will need to spend a whole lot more. the sound is great and it is easy to play. only about 41&#34; long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs. stated in the description. my strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what i will need. 5
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago.  ultimately, they're simply the best for the money.  you can get them for less than $3 per pack, if you shop around. 5
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass.  applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets, wipes right up.  a must to keep wood looking fresh. 5
bought this pick looking for options around the old "dropped pick" syndrome. i was skeptical, as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most. however, once between thumb and index finger, these darlings hang on! 4
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...broken! ok...i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.of course,i could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase! 1
i have never been much of a fan for coated strings. i normally use daddario ej 16's but i do like these elixirs, after about 4 weeks of playing they are starting to fade, not stay in tune and i notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole. they do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround 4
high quality hassle free design.  very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  very happy with this purchase. 5
this is a very nice cable, i like this one better than all the other ones that i own, its thick and the sound is great. then one day an amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off, that stunk 5
they work no issues handy to have on hand. dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place 4
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars. easily stretched and tuned with no problems. you can not go wrong with d'addario strings. 5
they are and look the right size and fit the cover well, a must when you want the right screw for the job thanks 5
i bought this as an interface between my mixer, instruments, and mics to my macbook for garageband.  you have to go in and change the input and output in osx, but it works great! 5
my first reaction on opening the box that this came in was &#34;gee, it's a lot smaller than i expected.&#34; it looks like a cad equitek e100s but it's a fraction of the size. i'd even say it was cute. but how does it perform?i have two microphones i use for recording at my computer: a blue yeti usb electret mic, and a sampson samtr101a. of the two, the yeti is closer in design, as it uses an electret capsule and a built-in usb interface, like the go mic, so that's what i compared it to. i fired up garage band and plugged both microphones into the computer (a four year old imac) so i could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks with acoustic guitar, ukulele, and double bass.right off the bat i was impressed with the go mic's lack of latency; it was as good as the yeti- maybe better. there was no perceptible delay.  no need to find a special driver, either. plug it in and it's ready to go. there's even a headphone jack in the mic- something unusual in a package this tiny. sound was good, too, though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti. i tried all three modes: carodid, carodid + -10bd pad, and omni. omni gave the best, clearest sound, not unexpectedly, but it was hard to get a good level when close miking. no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping. using the -10db pad i was able to get some acceptable levels from a few feet away. best sound on all instruments was obtained from 6-10 feet using the omni mode.it has one advantage over the yeti: it's very modest in current requirements, so i can run it directly off my ipad. the two together make a nice portable recording/production combination. packaging is well thought out, too. the mic is permanently attached via a swivel  to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand, and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection. and if that's not enough, there's a separate case to keep dust and dirt out of the mic.while the go mic wouldn't be my first choice for recording music, it would be a very acceptable one for recording musical ideas on the go, and perfectly acceptable for voice recording, podcasting, or skyping. 4
small amazing good quality interface. this is not the presonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable. i especially like the dual inputs on front. back light on knobs shows clipping on volume (green and red) and connected (green).usb powered and plug and play. my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds. 5
i like these strings. i have had nothing but problems with ernie ball strings, especially the higher ones unravelling at the ball ends and breaking as you are tuning up for the first time after a change. i have also found that the ernie balls break easily as well. i have had no problems with these, they sound good, feel good, and they are priced right. 5
dont be cheap.  take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars.  the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that.  if you are doing more than just finger-picking, you might want to add pick-shield.  my wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which i had very mixed feelings about.  if you play mostly standing, this is the guitar for you.  if you sit down, it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back.  but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar.  good structural integrity thus far.  my newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it.  i really should get a case. 4
i didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that i wasn't sure if i would like it or not. there were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price. they were good quality and if this didn't work out then i would have probably gone that route. to my surprise, this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar. the only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar. the local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down. i replaced the strings right away. i'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it. definitely worth the price you pay. 5
great strings, and they last well! i've never had a problem with these and i'm glad i can get them on here for a decent price. 5
it ok, its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle, the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface....11u rack, not 12u.... 4
there is no doubt about it, national fingerpicks are pretty much the standard.  the metal fingerpicks are rock solid, sturdy-gauge steel.  the plastic thumbpicks match tone very well.  and, note that unlike what you may read in another review, they are adjustable.  you just need to heat them up in some hot water and bend to fit.  on my resonator, these provide a full, loud sound.  the only reasons that for me these don't rate 5 stars are that (1) the pro-pick f tone fingerpicks i usually use provide much more of a sense of feel, and (2) the national fingerpicks have a tendency to be a little noisier than the pro-picks on the guitar's unwound strings.  even though i like the national metal fingerpicks much better than plastic fingerpicks i've used, and even though they produce more fullness than the pro-picks, for me the sense of feel that i get from the open-finger design of the pro-picks trumps volume.  this is important to keep in mind for players whose only fingerpicking experience is with fingers alone.  players who are already used to metal or plastic fingerpicks should give the national picks strong consideration.  they are solid, sound great, and this packaging of them is excellent!  by the way, the bonus pick is cute (and will go in my logo pick collection), but it's a very thin gauge to be useful to me on anything other than electric guitar. 4
this thing rocks! unlike other cheap chinese-made ripoffs (ahem... behringer) these joyo products are well made, inexpensive and worth every penny. 4
i started using these a few years ago.  picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps. 5
i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks8291xx pro double x keyboard stand. while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports, i was unable to use it with anon stage 2 tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed. the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube, and had it mated, the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard.when attached to theon stage ks8291xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa7040tb adjustable microphone boom, blackattached to the top screw-in post that perfectly mates with the boom, this attachment bar/boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use (aroland rd-300nx digital stage pianoor aroland v-combo 76 key stage keyboard).bottom line, make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar (according to the manufacturer it will work with most x-style stands), and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted. the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 7.5".  if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar + boom or other mic holder to clear, you can gain an additional 3" with ashure a26x 3" mic mount extension tube. 5
i put these on a parker.  great that they have uniform tension.  took a bit to get used to, but they are very playable.  vlues, rock, country.  nice strings. 4
been using these for years. they feel great, last longer than any other string and most importantly, they sound great.they cost a little more than other strings but they're worth it. 5
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price. well-designed and reliable, i highly recommend these. thanks to amazon for offering this great product. 5
i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass. these things work really great. i love them. 5
this passive di-box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input.  some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation.  the -20db attenuation sounded funny, but that is probably because i used the same equipment for all attenuation settings.  with each attenuation setting, i had to adjust the input volume accordingly.  this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops.  all the devices that i tried this with did not have their own internal grounding, so i needed to have the ground come from the mixer.  i did get some hum when i would touch the case, just like i did with other di-boxes.  this product worked very well for my needs. 5
whats not to  love, inexpensive, and does it's job....after reading some of the rather poor reviews, i checked it out for  signs of poor quality or workmanship... only thing i found was that  the pin rockrd a bit... there were three screws in the body that i used a screwdiriver to tighten up.. .i suspect that complaints of falling apart could have been from missing or loose screws... not much of a chore. i did back out the screws a bit and added a drop of clear nail polish on the threads for some insurance that it would not loosen up...anyway, that is the view from where i sit...just got it and used it, i will add to the post if things turn bad.. 5
...but it works fine for me.i used to connect a orange micro terror head amporange amplifiers micro terror mt20 20w hybrid guitar amp head (standard)to a cabinet ppc108orange ppc108 1x8" speaker cabinet 4
yes, ever so slightly. does it give you more sustain? none that i can really tell. people have been debating whether a steel, brass, or pot metal block makes a difference in tone and sustain. i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass. this is what is giving the deeper sound. the strings go over the bridge pieces and so i don't think material matters for the block much, if at all. i think it is about the actual mass. people who will say it makes a big difference are suffering from the placebo effect. without debate, this will add weight to your guitar. i think for the price, it is worth upgrading the thin old style mexican blocks. this is pot metal as well, which, again, is fine. the rest of the assembly is well made, as well, and seems just like the stock bridge you would find on a stock mim strat. if you are thinking of going gfs blocks, this is cheaper, and will fit perfectly without you having the problems of not having holes line up etc., which is a common complaint and indicative of gfs's crummy products in general. i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another. 4
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. using just one wall wart you can power all of them, at least those that receive this kind of power 9v. where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l6 converter 'cl6' for line 6 products. i have an m-audio black box which had a peculiar size plug. it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit. then i tried the l6 converter and bingo i'm in business and black box bliss. i would recommend having it around just for that. it costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can't find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters. a pedal junkies salvation. 5
i bought this because i was going on a trip and needed an amp i could pack in my suitcase that would work with a battery.i had a similar amp before that died. the honeytone is very compact, but looks cool and is very simple to operate, with just three controls, volume, tone and gain (distortion). i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume. if you try playing clean, with no distortion, you'll be underpowered. the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation. i tried a regular electric guitar, a lap steel guitar, a slide guitar, an acoustic-electric guitar, an acoustic-electric mandolin and a silent banjo. i thought the acoustic guitar would overwhelm this little amp, but i was surprised that it added to the projection and wasn't bad on the tone. it has a handy belt clip and a useless little leather handle (just for looks). i am using it to play an electric instrument in jamming situations where everyone else is playing acoustic, and i can adjust my volume to blend in. i think a mike with an unbalanced output (1/4&#34; phone jack) would also work in here, for street corner singing, for instance, though i haven't tried that yet as all my mikes use xlr jacks and there would be the issue of a mike stand or a lapel or headphone mike with a phone jack output, which might be hard to find.overall, i'm very pleased with this amp and it seems sturdy and reliable so far, and at $20, a bargain. 5
always the best string i buy.  i like the martin coated as well but i prefer the elixer.  this is the first set i baught for my electrics but so far so good. 5
this polish works well for what i need it for. i am not a clean freak but i take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig, but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there. 4
my kids were excited to split this pack of picks. since there were two of each in the pack, they didn't have to argue over who got which pick. these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing. i think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the 60's and 70's. 5
i usually play my jazz bass fingerstyle, but there are songs where i prefer a pick, especially when i need speed and accuracy. until i found the hard wedgie rubber pick, i used a heavy fender pick, but didn't like the sharp pick sound very much.i bought a set of soft, medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i'm really happy with the results. i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke, i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie's really nice for my jazz bass. i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the wedgie's are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments. i prefer the 3.1mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes, but that's entirely subjective.i'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me. 5
a dull, inept version of a tubescreamer. just sounds flat and boring. not very inspiring. at all. (then again, i never did really like ts's)....... 1
my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand. it comes with a cord that has a standard 1/4 inch end. i plugged it into a small guitar amp. they use it mainly to sing along with their cds/mp3's. note that this is not really a mic i would use in my studio - it is more of a toy to be honest, but a quality toy for a young child. in that regard i give it five stars. 5
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board. the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you. however, i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible. my complaint, like other reviews i read, is that the end doesn't seem to fit snug on some connections. for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals, dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal. the boss pedals however, were hit or miss. can't say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss, but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals. i have a couple ehx pedals also, one side is snug the other loose. anyway, for the money, i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable, nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable. 4
i don't gig. it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd. but if you're like me, play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres, this amp is a blast. it is very likely that i will play a johnny cash song on tuesday and a metallica song on wednesday. pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound. no pedals, no hours of minor tweaks, just punch it up and learn the song. virtually every genre is represented here. i also have to mention that although i like metal, i rarely play it. i prefer traditional r'n'r sounds and the spider iv recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds. even with the best modeling in the world, my les paul does not sound like a strat being played through 65' fender. it sounds digital. no getting around it.something else that weighed into my purchase was durability. although i only play for fun, i still play 2-3 hours a day. my 9 year old also is learning to play, so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily. the one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of line 6 amps was that they were long lasting and durable. i have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger 120 just becuase they can take such a beating.ultimately i decided that for the price ($300 at the time), i couldn't beat the line 6. there is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp. they sound better, more prefessional. they are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes. although the line 6 sounds tinny and at max volume, for in home play, it sounds terrific. there are mountains of reviews that compare the line 6 to vox, marshall or fender. they are all better than the line6, every one of them. but be prepared to pay 10 times the price for effects pedals, head units, cabinets, cables, etc. to get those flawless professional sounds. good amp, great value. 4
this is a great capo!  i had been using kyser quik-change capos for a good portion of my ten years of playing but they had their limits.  for one, intonation wasn't always right and my guitar (especially my electric) would go out of tune frequently.  after trying others, i settled on the shubb and it outguns the kyser in every aspect.  its features surprised me.  it is small and incredibly light weight, you almost can't tell that it's there. the adjustable knob is great and allows you to dial the capo to the right pressure so that you don't get any annoying buzz.  also my tone has greatly improved (which is an awesome bonus) making my acoustic sound much clearer and much more defined as opposed to the kyser which i noticed muddied up the sound.  even though you have to make some adjustments this capo is still easy to use and is one of the best investments i have ever made! 5
works great 5
i quite like the sound of this thing, running through a crate acoustic guitar amplifier. it sounds really natural, and it's easy to dial in a nice sound. it's hard to hear it while you're playing; you're better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you, or trusting someone else to set the amp. like most of these kinds of pickups, it's quite susceptible to feedback, so you can't get out in front of the amplifier and listen. not a slam on the product-that's just the nature of the beast. i'm an honest to goodness terrible violinist, but i got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children. it's a beginner class, and hearing the right sound is really helpful. it works great. i don't turn it up very loud-just a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room. i hate the &#34;short&#34; cord, and i wish i could use a regular instrument cable, but i can understand that they don't want a lot of weight pulling on your violin. but the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifier-unless you use some kind of little pre amp. in fairness, the cord is a reasonable length, but i'm quite tall, so it's 5' of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder. 4
okay mine has just arrived.. so first of all i want to say packaging is great!!..i have just put it on my guitar and i have to say that i am impressed!!... the sound is so warm and bright. i have a nanoweb before, and so far the exp16 is better...  i will stay on with the exp16 right now!!..great quality string... 5
these fender 10 foot guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buck!every part of these cables are quality. 5
so perhaps i don't know what shade burgandy really is. or the picture is a bit misleading. it is as stated, although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven. as too "dee"s reveiw... the buckle doesn't seem to bother me. i am not calling him or her out or anything. my best guess, it's playing style. i myself play bass, when i first started i played on the 3" inch straps and found they bothered me, went to the 2" straps proplem solved. i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother. but for me and the way i play... no complaints. 4
in case you were wondering, this is a clone of the boss compressor/sustainer.  it does a very good job reproducing the original at a fraction of the cost.  you add noise to your chain with any compressor because that's what they do- they elevate quiet signal and minimize volume spikes to even it all out.  when it is off, this thing had pretty decent bypass but i would not string an entire board together with pedals that are not true bypass because it would suck tone.  the box is plastic, but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate.  i've not yet heard of a behringer stomp box failing because the plastic box crushed when someone stepped on it.  people do like to complain about the battery cover being annoying and i have to say- aren't they all??? seriously- when you can hook up a daisy chain and not ever have to deal with a dead battery ever again in your life, what are you complaining about?  the knobs are solid, and work just fine.  i own like a dozen of these cheap behringer pedals and i have never had a problem with any of them.  you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box. 5
it does the job. it's bulky but it works well. it comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets (or to use the tablet while still in the case). 4
the evans pedal patch will work for you great.. it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty..  i cheap buy and it works excellent.. 5
this item really speaks for itself. it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop. the base is nice and weighted, but not too heavy to be unwieldy. it's a solid piece that serves its purpose and offers convenience for anyone looking to place a microphone on their desk.i would recommend you grab a shock-mount with this if you don't already have one, as it transfers vibrations though the stand! but that is honestly to be expected. 4
works for practice ... it's a guitar instrument cable, what can i say ... maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose. 3
sorry fender...this one is just a waste of money.  get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots. 1
i bought my son a thousand dollar epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago, so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for christmas, i told him an expensive one was not in our budget.we went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one. the sound was absolutely fabulous, much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one.the store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well. in my opinion, this was as good as other brands costing three times as much. i'm not sure how takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money, but if you're looking for a starter guitar, or just looking to add another guitar to your collection, this would make an excellent choice.i inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar, but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price.we also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs. thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar, natural. 5
i've been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now. they have a great, not-too-bright sound and you don't get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings. these tend to last me about 3 months! so, i am very happy with them. they also track pretty well with my roland synth, so no gripes there. all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great. 5
you need this to get the most out of your super-champ xd amp. the only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic. no telling how long the switches will last? fender tends to make good products. price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo. 4
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands. if you have the smaller "screw headed" ends on your microphone stand, you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing. (maybe a dollar, if they don't just give it to you.)using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places, as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way.no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out, getting in the way, plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made, very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them.the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight.the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera.the set screw presses against a ball-socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile. i am very careful not to over-tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob.i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing, but at this price i guess you can't expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism, eh?there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a 90-degree preset angle.the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera.be careful. the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting, removing or switching cameras. i found a little 'plastic threaded washer-like ring' that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use. you could easily find many types of washers, screws, plastic pieces, etc., to hold it in place when in storage or transport. you could also leave it attached to your camera. either way, be careful not to let it fall out and get lost.overall the "little thing" is quite solid, heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small, basic, solid and inexpensive.it holds well when bumped or moved. mine has absolutely "no slop" in it, does not wobble or come loose. i would not put a larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter. most modern devices will do just fine.again, just make sure you tighten it up 'just enough' to hold it well. don't put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years. mine has.i'm happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas.hope this helps! 4
i've owned a half-dozen led music stand lights over the years. this one puts them all in the shade (pun intended; sorry).the 9-led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern. the light is concentrated in the desired area and doesn't spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights. the little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when it's pointed back at the music. the light is two-level: normal and bright! normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater. the fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of stand-light bulbs is a definite plus. if you need to put a color filter over it, you don't have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter. the light spread is so smooth and consistent that i don't have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with two-head stand lights.the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well. the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights. the included zipper case is fairly big and bulky, but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag. it has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries, a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light, and a small pocket for the ac adapter. it's hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket, but there's plenty of room for it in the case. i don't know about battery life yet, but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the ac adapter (usually an optional purchase).this light is a bit large compared to other led stand lights, but it's so good that i don't really care. i've gotten years of service from mighty bright lights, and i expect the same from this. even if this one doesn't last, i'll keep buying more. 5
i have the older version of this as well this newer one.  the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way, like banjos, mandolins.  sometimes this new one just won't &#34;hear&#34; the string being tuned unless it's 'encouraged'.  that wasn't the case with the first model.  it's not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate.  the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it. you could find the tuning being done several semi-tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons.  the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices.  and these won't clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut, spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock.  but if you get it well clamped, it will stay there in the case or in use. 4
i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig.i am a bass player by trade, though i dabble with many other instrument (as many of us do). i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows, when the sound system is adequate, via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di.around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there. for being a thin flexible cable, i notice no noise issues or interference problems.i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal, (which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals) and then to the mixer. i use the at 10' xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show, then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc.the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment, unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables. this cable, at least in its 10' form, sounds just as good as my mogami silver 25' xlr. i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic. i have several. i don't have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables.on short, i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike. 5
i love these tuners.  i have tried the intel, krog, boss, etc... and out of all of them, i like the snark the best.  response and visual display are awesome.  unlike a couple of the others i've used, the snark works well on any place on the headstock.  a couple of the other brands i had to be careful where i positioned them because they didn't respond well.  you can't go wrong with any snark. 5
i've been recording professionally for 27 years; music, radio commercials and television mostly. so i'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase.i've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i can't remember them all but i can i say i've never had a bad a-t. 4033's, 4050's and 4080's i use every week and have for years, the 4033 going back to the mid 90's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a-t family. you have no idea the % of recordings that you're hearing this brand on, it's used by almost every studio on every continent, i work in the us, italy to scotland and can attest to this. but first let me tell you, very simply, where the negative reviewers went wrong.this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic, which is pro and best. so it requires a phantom powered xlr input, which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces. which you should really purchase along with this, if you haven't already, because for around $100 you'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring, you'll find one by searching audio interfaces. i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don't need avid hd's to get started. audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter. getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital. i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option. don't try an adapter on it, it won't work, as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor, but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want. it doesn't come with the cord, what a surprise! quality cords will cost about half the price of this, but a $15 version will probably do for most.it doesn't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like. work with it, you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do. you'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual, but i can also recommend using 2 large $1.49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen. this isn't about being cheap, there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don't work at strange angles and you'll probably always need one or the other.this does not come with a stand, so pick up a boom stand if you don't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over, 18 wheelers also tip over.recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they've put a faux plastic one. if it's possible, you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks, eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male. for desktop users, here's what i'd do. using large command strips and velcro i'd fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini-boomhere's another optionmxl mics mxl-bcd-standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting, if you need something figure it out, your clean, quiet recording is proof that it works.i can't justify comparing this to my $500 to $4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it. $82 wouldn't have bought a case for most of my condensers. it sure beats most non electret, electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics. the 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue. also individual mics have a sound, of the eight 4033's i have, i prefer 3 of them and use them the most. so when reviewers say it's bright, i say compared to what? i can tell you what it sounds like.....ka-ching! a great sound in audio recording. uh huh, i know of one professional recording it's on and the client was clueless that i used an $82 mic. think about it, would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago? have you heard good 70's recordings? anyone purchasing equipment because it "sounds" better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it. lot's of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don't ignore them but ask yourself this, do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities? any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $400 and won't be half of what you'll achieve by improving your recording technique.this type of mic is excellent for overhead, acoustics, amps or brass and of course vocals, really most recording needs, having a less uni and more omni, cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it's better suited to recording. just understand you can't get too loud near it or you'll overdrive it since it's designed for up to screaming vocals, so back off with loud amps and brass, which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it'll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor's tv. that, is a good thing, what's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment, so don't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise. you can't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind, just quiet, anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical, rather than electronic, signal to noise ratio. a 10db pad will reduce output but doesn't affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won't help, that's not even its purpose, i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam, music.tutsplus dot com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-acoustic-treatment--audio-1274 (just replace the [dot]). turn off your heat/air, be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 am, when the world's a quieter place and that will really help, you'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are. you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls, or buy used office partitions but you need quiet, i've known acoustic players who've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing. if this is what your budget allows for it's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost. i keep saying "this type of mic" and the reason why is because a-t sells 14 models like this style up to $3000. this model is the lowest priced but you're buying a reputable brand. if your future plans include using only one mic, without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware, you can look here.audio-technica at2020 usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at2020usb+ cardioid condenser microphone w/pop filterthis is not my advice, you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface. this model is not usb.now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds, i won't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio, descriptions are worthless, only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters. this is important, all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn't, the recording cannot sound better than the source, so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone. accurate or inaccurate, not good or bad, there's a difference. it's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound. apply these same thoughts to your home stereo, saying instead, playback cannot sound better than the recording and that's why accuracy is important in your monitors.so search out any info you don't understand and don't expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling, training and having worked in a professional setting. if you're lucky like i was, after 1 year of tech school i worked on site repair (studios often need pt) and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3, then after 3 years of work (tv) with another year of school i became a studio owner. real recording involves a facility, equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital. so study electronics, acoustics, the auditory cortex, everything audio, train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day, it never stops. when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn't mean you're educated in its use. so yes, i also don't recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother, unless.....but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording, quit all that sleeping, eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record! just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk, i have. so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i'm just here to help you out. if you need a good, small, inexpensive stereo amp check this one out. topping tp22 digital mini amplifier 5
it's great to have a few extra mic clips on hand and for the price, these are great.  they hold sm58/57 perfectly.  not cheap or poorly made at all, a great value. 5
i know this is a great product.  i've had a set before.  i have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  the product comes in a clam shell package.  for me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  there are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  i found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.  if i find a retaining clip that will work (i do have one to compare with) then i can use it.that said, i'll say again, the straplok system is a great product.  i know, i've owned another set for more than twenty years! 4
i got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. i had never used strap locks before and don't think i will again. 2
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.only thing i can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of it.it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.i was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.it seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor i ordered the product from.dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.they have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.this product as advertised did not come with any picks.if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately. 5
i bought this case for my rogue a-style electric mandolin.the inside is nicely lined; the hardware is solid.it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap.i recommend this to anyone with an a-style mandolin.jafmusicmix 5
using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet. it is holding a shure sm57 microphone.  the microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic, but i'm using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads. 5
the fact of the price for this and the 18 cent shipping is pretty damn good because i have 2 silverstone ss-11's and a stratocaster and i took parts of of one ss-11 to fix the other then i bought these strings for it fixed it up and now that guitar sounds better and less (buzzy) than the strat also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase i lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and really cheap shipping i will buy more later to fix my other guitar when i get the bridge nuts replaced 5
i tried this at the store.  it looks like it would protect a guitar, but the latches are kind of large and clumsy.  the interior was nothing special either.  i passed. 3
it hold my picks well, but some are to big for it and the tape/foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly. im neutral on this one. 3
i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john  view tips and guidelines | headline & 20 more words required./// 5
i use these strings on my practice guitar because the smaller strings are easier on my fingers. i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good. 5
this is a great package for beginners. i never played a ukelele before but i learned to play guitar many years ago.  i have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so i downloaded an app called "easy ukelele" available in amazon and google playstore for free.  that is the only ukelele tuner i can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. i purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so i have not yet preview the dvd and cd that came with it. i did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.my review:1. the package: the box comes with the ukelele, beginners manual, dvd, cd, carry pack, and 2 extra set of ukelele strings. tuner is not included so i advise that you either buy a tuner or download the "easy ukelele" app i mentioned above.2. the ukelele:  the ukelele looks and feels decent. it has a sticker that says made in china. it comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  i tuned it using the app i downloaded but it would not hold a tune. it is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  since the string is nylon, i gave it a chance to settle. i would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  i actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so i can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. the tuner pegs stays in place so i know that the problem is with the string.  it could be that the string included is a cheap one.  after doing this a few time on day 1, i was able to play my first song i grabbed from the book (clementine).  but after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  i just repeat what i did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. yesterday morning i tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when i came back in the afternoon, i checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key i left them in the morning. i played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and i was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  this morning, i checked the note again and they stay close to the g-c-e-a range. i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. even if i have to tune it every day  i would not have any problem with it.so, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. this are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. if it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  that is an easy fix.2. the string: as i mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. even if you buy a  good quality strings, i am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. it comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. the problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  from some research i found online they said that the thinnest string will be the a string. the second thinnest is the e string, the thickest is the c string and the second thickest is the g string. the extra string package says "gangia brand" on it so i assumed that that is the brand of the string.3. the book: i just scanned the book and i could tell that it is written well for beginners. the songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. each song have a chart on which chord you will use.4. the case:  the case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.5. the dvd's and cd's: i have not tried the dvd and cd's yet but the dvd's i believe will have the lesson and the cd will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. i will come back and edit this item once i get the chance to watch the dvd and listen to the cd.overall. this is a great price for the package. 5
i've only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well.  the cover is supple and easy to coil. 5
i found this to be very inaccurate but only on a few strings, so adjustment is not possible. i bought this because of the newer features & i like the strum & see which strings were out function but what good are nice features if the main function of the tuner is inaccurate! it's not a bad tuner, seems well built but unless you play so poorly or loud that tuning precision doesn't matter i'd go with the korg pitch black (which is what i was using in my home studio - well back to what worked!) 3
hold a tune very well, and sound good. the seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge, but thats ok.if you dont wipe them off after playing, they wont last long. but i always do, and i change strings often, so that isnt an issue for me.overall, some of the best strings available. 4
this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need. i would personally recommend the electro-harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price. 2
my favorite brand of strings right now. 8 guitars now are fitted. they bend easy, last longer, feel smoother and a shot of finger grease spray just adds the icing to the cake 5
this looper is serious worth every cent i spent on it. very simple, easy to use, and takes up less space on my pedal board than my altoids tin. the sound quality is perfect, i can record a loop and play it back through this thing and it still sounds like i am playing instead of a recorded loop (assuming i end the loop correctly). i run this in my effects loop of my ac-30's after the preamp and all the distortion i run beforehand (big muff, od, boost) all get captured clearly coming out of this pedal. the range of the loop level is perfect, just over noon and you match the input signal and over that allows you to boost your loop for a little more dynamics.i chose those over the digitech jamman express xt and i have to say it was worth the extra money, even though the sales person was a little disappointed.if you want a simple loop this is the one, it takes a little learning but once you figure it out you will love it. 5
aquila strings will never let you down. highly recommended by all serious ukulele players. italian made, need i say more. 5
easy to use does a great job and comes off when you want it to, and does not scratch or harm guitar in any way. great price as well. i got two of them. 5
i am not one to spend a lot on batteries so this was a no brainer. it has worked great now for over a year at least. i had to look it up and i have had this for 3 years tomorrow. 5
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  i guess this kit works okay, but it's hard to use.  it will probably last my entire lifetime.  i think a smaller kit would have been better.  you really need to remove the strings when you use it, so you have to take off all the strings.  i usually only replace one string at a time when i am changing strings, so i had to change my habits.  if you have a guitar without a truss rod, that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings, since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time, and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  i'm no expert, but i have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  however, since i love my guitar, i use it anyway. 3
my main headphones before were hd-280's, which i thought were pretty good, until i got these. i have several pair of hd-280's, one for mixing audio, one for practicing with drums (since they have decent isolation), and one for 'her' to use.i have one of these, and the amount of detail is great. i have a set of m-audio bx8a's, and these have a touch more clarity, which considering the price difference...wow. for mixing audio though, can't use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right, but, i think these will get used for mixing more and more, with the finalizing on the bx8a's.i didn't know headphones could sound this good. 5
this is my second case from them. build good for carry and balance. brass color lock that comes with it. 5
great rack.  small enought to fit on top of a table or under it.  light weight but holds a lot.  at some point i had 2 behringer amps, power conditioner and 2 single unit audio processors. 5
this stand is very nice, it is black and it does its job very well. it also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand. it is like an added bonus. 5
originally received the wrong item, but i contacted customer service and they returned my email that night (on a sunday) and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning.  i received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks.  great customer service, and love the pics...the color in the pictures doesn't do it justice! 5
it's a great little tuner, great accuracy, but unfortunately, they are a bit on the delicate side. the first one started working about a week after i bought it. just broke down. the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived. after piecing the two of them together, i have a nice stable tuner. but beware...these are manufactured on the cheap. 3
this inexpensive capo works as advertised. it's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup. 4
it just arrived to day and seems well-build.  haven't tried it yet. 5
all three of my kids have a guitar. they were always losing their picks. this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while! all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar. i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks! 5
it sounds like it's behringer.  very fake, cheap sounding phaser, but it's all i need.  i got it mostly for that big airplane woosh, and running it in the loop, it does that fine.  the highs are kind of harsh, but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame. 3
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recording/producing. i absolutely love these picks and swear by them. i've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that i landed on years ago and stuck to. i've had years of lessons, licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me! perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms. i'd order again if i had to. 5
i was very skeptical to buy a wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non-existent.that being said, the china i received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay.my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit. 5
this is a nice pick holder, especially for the price. it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use. 5
these pick have a permanent, fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material. it wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone. in fact, i found it increases speed. these are perfect for a fast-paced style of picking. the tone is bright and snappy!good quality material ensures i won't be needing another set for a long time! 5
my title says it all.  i didn't like the ac adaptor.  i did work very well and was strong.  i liked how solid it was. 3
i use this to run a single, mono xlr shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my tascam dr-40, which saves me a step in post-production.  the quality is fine and it does what it's supposed to do.  good price for a good product. 5
this is an amazing guitar. i couldn't put it down, i have experience playing really, really expensive guitars. my $500 "beater" acoustic i was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all, i couldn't imagine what i would b getting for $90. by was i wrong. it's my best acoustic currently! this thing sounds like, sustains, and holds its' own tune like a similar $2000.00+ martin model and that's zero exaggeration! get it and see, you will be blown away. i bought a second one. i just wish i had found this guitar sooner. 5
one of the strap buttons on a guitar i was given as a gift was missing.  i was told that it would need some minor repairs, so all i had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it.this strap button was screwed right in the minute i got it and it worked like a charm.  i put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn't given me any problems. 5
since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because i'm a beginner and don't have much calais yet. also i like the first day of new strings look shiny! i would recommend this to any beginner. 5
i just thought i would throw in another 5 star review which is based on the cost vs quality factor. i have several guitars, and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar. well i was dead wrong. it may not have the price tag of my "better" guitars, but it sure has the playability and sound. especially for the $100 tag on it. great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection. the simple, yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat. i will not shy away from epiphone anymore. don't make the mistake of not picking up this guitar only because it's not stamped gibson. 5
personally, i love the nanoweb strings.  i have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  as i'm no pro, i don't want to put strings on them that i'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.i don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit "different" than other strings.  they're exactly what i want - a string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings. 4
i'm certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings.  i got these for my husband, the aficionado guitar player in the family!  he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product.  so they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past!  highly recommended. 5
it is a nice smaller version of the 114si road pro.it would be great if it had a steel shaft.the plastic shaft feels like it will break.but it is cheeep! 3
i got this for $150 dollars when it was on sale. i don't like 8 inch speakers for gigging, but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a pa. the 8 inch speaker is okay for practice, and it has a jack for an external cabinet. be careful with the load you put on your amp though. 5
as i said on my last dunlop strap reviewi love the dunlop guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product i have 4 or 5 of them.when i buy a guitar i buy a dunlop strap and strap locks always to protect my investment. 5
this snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use (even for my children) and works well. the display is easy to understand and is very accurate (confirmed by our guitar teacher's meter). the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish.everything should be this easy to use and work this well!highly recommended!cfh 5
i've been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago. i use both electric and acoustic. the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will.  every once in a while i'll get a &#34;dead&#34; string. i'll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge. same thing with strings that break while tuning them up. 5
this pedal is awesome. not only does the dd-7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay, modulation, and loop functions. it's capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing. this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player. most of my pedals are boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards. this means their stuff is made to last. no flimsy plastics, cheap rubber, or faulty components or parts will cut it in boss's supieror product line. 5
i've got two other levy's cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they're fantastic! i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an 'extended length' version and that it was what i had bought before. i suppose it's just easier for theno big deal though, just an observation worth noting because if  you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases (and you're a big guy like me and/or you play with the guitar/bass around your knees) you may not be getting what you thought.in any case, these are very comfortable (soft edge), they stick on you (as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down), and they last. 5
i use the chair for guitar, bass, keyboards,ukulele and even cooking breakfast. lightweight, slightly awkward, but provides good back support.as a right-handed player i practice, both classical and jazz style, with the guitar on my left knee. for the position i use in this chair it is necessary to use the on stage fs7850b guitar foot rest. i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck. i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions.as for the four out of five star review, the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for $85. but it's a nice design and thank you to the designer. i would recommend it to those who can afford it.as for durability..... we shall see. i have had it for three months now and it is still fine.  i use it daily. 4
i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. the sound i get from the ad&g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. the strings seem to hold up well. i cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. these strings sound great, i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing. 5
i have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. the price is right for these, and they work just fine. my only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. however, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market. 4
i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap. plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play. if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made. 2
very nice tone, very nice metal sound, very crunchy and deep. well worth it for the price, on par with other way more expensive pedals. definetly buy the power supply with it though, it just makes it better and easier to use. very nice product overall 5
i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome.  top quality.  i would recommend these to anyone.  sincerely, doc 5
i'd read a lot about the one spot power system.  i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this.  it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet.  i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards...i may swamp them out fo this one.  highly recommend it. 5
i have one of these in every one of my cases. it's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it; nothing special but it does the job. 5
you can find "cheaper" ones, but sometimes the schallers are same price if not cheaper.  these are the best design of lock in my opinion and will hold up to years of abuse and use.  i've had several sets for 13+ years and use them without hesitation. 5
this is my first guitar stand and i have to say i am pretty happy with it.  it's made of good quality metal and you can tell it's much higher quality than the price tells it to be.  the neck strap and the base are excellent.  made of great padding to pad the bottom and can put any guitar base on there.  look at the other reviews and you won't be disappointed.  it didn't smell like the other reviews said either. 5
i really like this tuner.  i have always liked the planet waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy.  this mini tuner takes all i like about the larger planet waves model and makes it ultra compact.  it fits nicely on smaller intstruments such as mandolin and any instrument with headstocks that don't readily accept the larger tuners (banjo, telecaster etc.).  i currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate.  easy to read.  easy to see.another winner from planet waves.  (almost forgot to mention one other thing that is nice about this tuner is its stealth ... it can hide behind the headstock so you won't be concerned with it being always clipped on and it won't interfere with the look of your instrument). 5
i bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. they've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets, that i've used. i figured i'd save a bit and get a couple more from amazon. i got them fast and saved twenty bucks. they do fine with my fairly heavy fender and st blues guitars as well as my p bass. they are middle of the road for price and width, but give me no comfort issues at all. my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. super tight and easy to lower. raising it is a different story though. i just save the fast &#34;lower played&#34; songs for last. those are the best ones anyway. excellent strap. 5
in my opinion...this is the best amp in this category. i know people who have the marshall and the fender. i plugged into my little honeytone and i had the best sounding micro amp hands down. they were both amazed with the sound. they said "well mine was only $45 and "mine was only $40." too bad so sad for them. i told them mine was $20. since it doesn't say marshall or fender, i only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp. if you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts, and know what to expect from a micro, this amp does not disappoint 5
it's oil....what more do you want?turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion. immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away. let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.it's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary. don't saturate the fretboard and walk away, wood absorbs oil, too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling, losing shape and flatness. not a good situation.lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby. it's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean....like your frets...hint hint.just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper. 4
seriously, this is a great pedal. i can't improve upon what others have said, but i will mention a few points.1. i use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone, or to add more crunch to my fender frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. it's run before time based effects (delay, phaser, etc) for me.2. i sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster, while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. if it gets noisy or "self oscillates" after a while, change the battery to a fresh one. better yet, use an ac adapter.i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews. otherwise, it's been on my setup for about seven years. i take care of my stuff. 4
the one i got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw. i feel like if i tighten it too much, i could dent my mic stand tube. but i haven't dented anything yet, so perhaps i'm just too skeptical. in any event, it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction. but everything works. it's getting the job done and i haven't seen a better option. all in all, a pretty good device. 4
i love this tuner! its awesome to use and efficient! the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are. to my ear it sounds good but you never know??? 5
with musical instruments standing about on my office floor, i determined to find a better way to keep them available, and so i decided to hang them on the walls. this hanger was very easy to install. it comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself, or through drywall and into wall studs. i used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily. but a word of warning: use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall. if you don't, your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed. 5
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy... now if i can just decide where to adhere it, to my guitar or my music stand?  or to the desk where i sit and play?  maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument...  yeah, i think a few of these would be nice. 5
it's the tube screamer of delay pedals. i use mine primarily to thicken up my tone, and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board. i have used it for situations that call for deep delay, and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey... i fall back on a ehx memory man chained to an anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the 2 delays in experimentation sequences, but when playing blues or thrash, i use it as tone beef only. low settings not too echo-ey, more like a bass'd out reverb.there are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal, and it is a testament to it's versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres.hey - stop reading this and order it! now!!!! 5
i really like this tuner.  it works very well.  once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner (ie., the moving black squares to no longer move),  then tuning is a simple and accurate thing.  it works great on all of my guitars, acoustic and electric.  comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it.  it cause a few bucks, but i think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons, that it is worth it. 5
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build. this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply. i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal. it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables. my board looks great, works well, and i love this power supply 5
i&#8217;m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they&#8217;re what they are. guitar picks. however, the price was good. 5
buy this. it's cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much. it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard.....amazing sounds! 5
works as advertised.  i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived, but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work.  pretty simple, even if you're "technically challenged."  easy to use.  haven't gigged with it yet, but i can imagine that this strap "isn't going anywhere," regarding its functionality.  not a "pretty" product, but good stuff. 5
very useful. 5
the very first thing i noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  what this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  the &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood, if this makes sense, and i can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.i found someone selling only the dunlop strap buttons, which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars, and was about to order them when i found planet waves elliptical end pins.  i think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap, unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders, and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  i've ordered a set. 3
i've found no issues with noise or build quality so far; the 1 foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their input/outputs in weird places. 5
it supplies my microphones every time i run out. i'm glad i got this thing. i rate it five out of five stars. 5
i use 2 to stereo mic my egnater, works great, nice sound, to my ears not much different from an sm-57 and is a fraction of the price. it's not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me! too noisy for hand held vocals, put it a mic stand instead. 5
i've used this stand for about two years now and it held up great. it does what it's supposed to do and for the price it's one of the best  thank you  and guess what  in  amazone  you can find it much cheaper than music store 5
this is a great music stand, i like how it's adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in.  it's very sturdy and well built.  i don't ever worry that it'll tip over.  i love it.  i would recommend it. 5
i just received the case today, the soonest delivery day on the estimation range (a plus there!).  now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet, this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case.  nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim-threading and basic locks (keys included) are gold toned (instead of silver toned pictured), but that doesn't mean diddly-squat to me.  plush interior with a small, yet roomy, compartment located under the neck.  i am primarily a 5-string banjo player, but decided to casually play around with the mandolin, and so i figured i had better get a hard case for possible "long-time" storage (my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before i started getting serious with it... and boy, not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces).  this case will definitely do the trick.  excellent value!- additional note, there is a bit of extra play around the peg-head (i have an rover mandolin)... i can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough, some peg snapping may occur.  but again, for simple storage/protection, its a non-issue. 5
it's a very cute little capo. it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small. but it works. 5
guitar picks make a huge part of your tone.  especially on acoustic.  these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion.  they have a long life and do brighten your tone.  freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or  carpet scrap to bring back the original shape. 5
i've been a musician for most of my life, playing primarily keyboards recently in the studio and with bands, saxophone and a little bass guitar. i've owned a six string guitar for 20+ years that has seen very little use. i had this misconception that my hands &#34;just weren't designed to play guitar&#34;. but recently my life changed a little bit. i have a young boy that's now master of my universe, a lot less room to leave musical gadgets lying about, and i now live in an apartment building where making a lot of noise tends to be frowned upon.i picked up this micro crush because i was originally looking for a micro marshall and i saw this pop up. i knew i already liked the sound of orange amps (better than marshall given my druthers of musical taste) and for $69 it seemed like not much of a reach to try it out for myself.shortly after a small package of value came to me with this charmingly tiny amp in it. my son's mom thought it was a toy &#34;it's so small!&#34; yes you might think so until you plug it in. the idea here is to sound loud without being loud. this amp is perfect for that.most of the time i have this thing turned up to about 1, 1 1/2, rarely up to 2 or beyond. i've got a simple effect chain going in: eh soul preacher (compressor/sustainer) -&#62; mx analog delay -&#62; cheap (but pleasant) chinese phaser -&#62; eh holy grail -&#62; amp. i use this as my &#34;clean&#34; sound without the overdrive. it is beautiful. a little dick dale-ish. then when i want a little edge i turn off the phaser and delay and turn on the overdrive. maybe nudge down the volume a little more and i can rock ac/dc licks at midnight without raising complaints from the neighbors. and it sounds ... big!no this is not the same as actually being loud. for one thing your ears won't ring. the cops won't come knocking to serve a noise complaint. knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves.  the dogs won't howl.but should you desire to rock out at midnight in your apartment building this amp fits the bill.so much so that i, the man with the hands &#34;just not made for guitar&#34; now have guitar callouses, a lust after a couple $1.5-$2k guitars one of which will soon come home with me and frankly a love for playing the guitar that i never had before in my life. this all because i can just set up my little rig next to the couch and it's always there. always ready to go. so i play while i'm watching football or baseball. i play while i'm watching the news. i play while i'm playing crazy 8's with my son. i play morning, noon and night. not only that but i'm actually getting to be not-that-bad at playing either. lots of playing/practice seems to inevitably make on better (hint: do those finger exercises too, they work).so i am not exaggerating when i reiterate my headline: this little amp changed my life (for the better).best buy for under $100 i've made since i bought my son his strider balance bike. which is orange too! 5
the mooer pitch box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch, and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signal.the pitch knob allows you to raise the note 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones, or lower the note by 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones.i found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the pitch box made the harmonies more pronounced. making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable. and in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organ.when i had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal, it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar. the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it. 4
i ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams, but alas, i was wrong. the winding apparatus works beautifully, but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference, so i'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. all in all, a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.i cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily, the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge, which i think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. each to their own, i suppose. 4
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 2
arrived on time..packaged well. happy with purchase...they are your regular picks..will order again if needed. happy with purchase. hope you enjoy em... 4
they do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand. the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey. 3
no complaints about this hardware.  easy to install with patience, easy to use.  the click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.these work like a light switch...on/off, so i'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  there aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.i've installed these on a 3/4 hoener, full sized squire acoustic, and 2 fender strat's. 5
i installed the ragin' cajun into my fender super champ x2. i immediately noticed a difference in the quality, fullness and volume of my amp. it has turned my amp into a amp that is now capable of being used at small gigs. an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed. 5
these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently. if you want one set to cover both applications, this is a good choice. 5
this is a wonderfual addition to help maintain the humidity for your guitar, this product is recommended by taylor guitars. 5
i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install.  the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall.if you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures, so i will have to do new pictures, but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack & decker bdl100av all-in-one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.as far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.i do not, however, recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.edit: i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes.  the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  it took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.  at any rate, you do not need to drill pilot holes; just nail and go! 5
this is a super easy to use pedal. you just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset. don't worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound. if you really want to be able to tweak everything, then get the mxr analog chorus instead. it has about six knobs. i like the ease of use on this one, and i omly use chorus sparingly. another cool feature of mxr pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it. it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot. 5
its a nice pice,, easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar,,, the only matter and its not a big deal,, is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect 4
i am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...first the positives:- looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice pricenow the significant disappointment:- inaccuratethe settings were on a-440 but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since d'addario now owns planet waves products, they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner (it has its place i guess, but i much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision imo) ...i haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models ...bottom line, no matter how nice the snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard a-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ... 1
love these picks. have used them for years. feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. highly recommend. 5
so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after  a couple of years of easy work. behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most. i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack. so much more efficient than a floor monitor. i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips, and because there is more than one channel, i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel. very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony, or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics. definitely recommend ... hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space! 5
stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity. a must have for us dry californians. 4
i don't use the other features, but as a tuner, this product is spot on.  filters out noise well when using the mic.  only two things to gripe with - 1.  the leg that you can use to prop this up isn't very usable. and 2. it's not great for gig use as the screen isn't that readable.as a home tuner or for a brightly-lit gig - excellent! 5
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.size and fit were good. the storage compartment is nice and large.one hinge broke after about a year of normal use. it was in the house almost the whole time, i just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done. i noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.this was not an expensive guitar, and i had a better case, so i switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that i really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage. 3
arrived fast, had them up and running in minutes.  it was easy to adjust my eq on my laptop to produce awesome listening music, just beautiful, clear, nicely separated sound.  i wouldn't use these for high volume stuff, the sound is almost delicate, and very precise in its separation.  the classical musician's in our guild loved the sound, that should tell you something.  stunning, really.  they are, in fact, exactly what they are advertised to be - top notch small room project studio monitors.  i readjusted my eq for the needed flat response for sound engineering and i was extremely pleased with the results.  the sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust, as the flat studio mixing eq sounded horrible at first, as it should!  i have been in and out of studios for 30 years and i can say, used appropriately, these are excellent near-field mixing monitors.  take time to review the set up data from m-audio, its good stuff, and don't ask these little beauties to be everything, just let them be what they were made to be . . . and enjoy!  we ended up re-mixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via cubase 7 and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by 30%. 5
the only complaint i have about this is that there's no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over. this probably doesn't matter to all of y'all though. other than that, it's a very nice machine with a flashing light and two &#34;click&#34; options. easy to use and quality built.  ~pegleg~ 4
i use this for my rockband microphones but be careful , if you have cats the hair will get stuck in it. other than that it really works well in taking away some of the echo from loud speakers while playing rockband. 5
after reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more, i decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way, if a longer unit is needed, i can just screw 2 together.  this is an excellent piece of hardware, very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  even when i put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so i could mic it from the front, using an sm 57, and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.great buy. 5
this music stand is og great quality and of a great price.i have been very pleased with it. i have bought on-stage stands in the past before, so i was sure that i wouldn't be disaapointed and i was right.very sturdy-well built-good price. 5
i use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out.  individual volumes controls make it perfect. 5
well i found the lesson very good and worth the money i payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great 3
great strings! used them for years -- always loved them. put them on an eric johnson strat. wouldn't use anything low quality for that guitar. 5
adjustments are easy to make and the fit/feel is fine. no fancy designs, but a great value for the price. 5
i love the snark tuners, and i own several different models.  they all work great and of the various models, i prefer the sn-2 (red).  i got the white one because i just liked that it was a unique, amazon-only model.  the sn-13 display is like the display on the sn-8, and offers lower resolution than the sn-1/sn-2/sn-5 displays.  still it works beautifully, and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my pearl white apx700.  its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark. 5
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician.  three big ones are the jet sound, choral/flange and leslie speaker! 5
the best buy for your bass drum 5
very good stand especially for the price. it is not incredibly stable, but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy. 5
takes you hours to play around with all the sounds. built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage. nice and loud in a small package. 5
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele.  it's attractive.  it's well made. it's fork is a tad large for the ukulele  it has rubber o-rings that slide, so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then.  but then, even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase (or wall, if you use it there).  the uke hits when i put it in the hanger, so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase.many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners.  this is much less expensive, holds very well, is even more low profile than this hanger, and never drops a uke. consider it for your needs.i'd not buy another of these for a ukulele.  it likely works fine for a guitar, though.i deducted one point for the fact that, even though it's adjustable (the o-rings), and advertised for ukes, it doesn't work well for them.  and it's heavy and not stylish, in my opinion.  i have the hercules wall hanger (mechanical gripper) for my electric guitars, and it's fabulous (for guitars; overkill for lightweight ukuleles, maybe).hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp39wbupdate 9/7/11: the more i use it, the less i like it.  i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all, and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune.  so, for small instruments (you'd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos), this is atrocious.  for guitars, it's not as good as hercules. 3
width and padding are good for heavier guitar (currently being used on a les paul). finish, stitching, and adjustments are quality.the only issue i had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegs.you might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in place...but that means the guitar is very secure, so i am very happy. 5
i use this for my home recording studio. this stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle. from playing and singing piano, recording guitar and vocals, and other various positions. sometimes hard to keep the mic firmly in place but that may be a function of my shock mount.cheap and highly recommended. 4
there was nothing wrong with my original neckplate, but i was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra.  it was a direct replacement for the original. 5
exceeded my expectations on quality and price.  when i saw the deal on amazon, i thought it would be low quality harmonicas, but they are good quality. 5
i've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess i own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). over the years, i've tried several different brands of string. the truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. it's just that the martin m600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus. 5
this installed easily. a nice feature is ability to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument.  when the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain i might have had with earlier straps.  a keeper for sure. 5
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning.  it has many features i have yet to utilize, but good to know they are there if needed. 5
i bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that i use with my bass.  the 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non-intrusive smart looking setup.  i'm pleased.  i've owned them for a few months now.  no issues at all and they look good. 4
shipped fast, sounds great and the price was way better than a lot of other places that i know of 5
this is an amazing pedal. delay , flanger ,phaser , tremolo , pitch shifter. all sound really good and completely adjustable. only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time. for the price this is a steal. behringer rocks. 5
obviously these aren't top of the line strings but i used them to record a track in drop c and it sounded awesome. after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin.d'addario is awesome if you keep in mind that they're on the cheaper side. 4
good cable, as good as any expensive brand. thick, a bit stiff and seems to be shielded. no complaints at all. 5
i really like these strings, because i have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast. i can play a guitar once, and leave it there for 2-3 weeks, and the strings will be rusty and nasty when i return to it. i now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them, but this stil happens.then i happened across these elixir nanowebs. they are great. i no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly, and they stay rust and gunk-free for 2+ weeks (of regular playing). however, i did encounter one strange thing. while playing at a rehearsal, my e-string just popped and broke, hurting my finger a bit. i was surprised, because outwardly the string didn't look that bad.so that is the downside. with regular strings, you can tell the string is near the end of its life b/c it looks really bad. with these, they may still look okay but be close to breaking. made me a little cautious.i still prefer these 100% over other strings, though. 4
i love this little guy. clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you, it will still accurately tune the guitar. very easy and simple to use. i paid $9 for it and it is 10 times better than the $40 one i have. 5
by definition, medium is an in between size. but when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. on that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. for me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. i don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. but i do have periods where i will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. for me, these light-medium are exactly where i want my strings to be.if you like martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. i don't feel i am missing anything compared to the medium. if i had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, i would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. but without that, i don't think i'd notice the difference with normal listening. with the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.if martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste. 5
this is an absolute must-have item for any gigging drummer! holds your drink, just like it says it will. what more can you ask for out of a drink holder? no more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy (at least not unintentionally). pro. 5
everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy, add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set 5
