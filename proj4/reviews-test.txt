if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button, these are great buttons to use.  it comes with two buttons, two washers and 4 screws (two different sizes). 5
great tuner! it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar. i will buy another one of this. 5
solid, stays where i put it, and does a great job holding a heavy mic, mount and pop filter. can't really beat it for the price. 5
really helpful both in live gigs and at home.great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand 5
quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. thank you very much 5
i like the durability of it, and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be, but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a pa live yet. i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better shure later on. 4
there is a reason this is the number one best selling guitar effect pedal on the market.  the tube screamer just works.  :-) 5
i was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my fender beginner's mandolin set, worried i'd permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them. having a dozen similar--a few for me and a few to share--meets the need! he heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice, especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks. 4
i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar. there is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state (this is a solid state). people will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a $400 tube amp to practice through. (&#34;you're not getting the right tone, man....&#34; the problem with that is, there are several companies out there marshall, fender, vox, orange, etc....and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one. so, i figured, before i committed to a company, maybe i could just use this fender to emulate some of those sounds i want.that worked out beautifully. though i am very much a beginner, i have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp's eq can have on your guitar's tone. i thought i needed pedals to have some of these effects, instead i can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger/reverb/modulation i need. i have got to the point where i understand about how just adjusting my volume/switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when i want to.i would not have been able to do that without this amp. this amp helped me develop as a beginner so i wouldn't waste money buying other things, beginners think they should get. excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii. save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more. 5
it's been a while since last we got together. the old amps we had were way too big. for me this one is just right.fender mustang i electric guitar amplifier 5
good quality bag for my epi lp. fit like a glove, in fact i wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories. 4
this is the wah i was looking for.  very versatile and built in boost feature is great too. buy it...you wont regret it. 5
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar. it sounds good and looks really nice. i get compliments on it. 5
i was really looking forward to receiving this amp. i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight. unfortunately, from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser-like effect to the sound. i tried different basses with it. i tried different cables with it. i tried using it in different places, away from computers and fluorescent lights. i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase-shifter sound came out. i tried all different knob and eq settings as well. nothing helped. so, i'm returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better. i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don't think less of ampeg, (at least not yet).i really hope it's a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful. for $99 it's packed with cool features like an effects send, a cd in, a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice. it also just looks cool and very pro. my intention is to use this for a monthly "bistro" gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small, so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here.i have to say, buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online. they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label. if there is a choice between amazon.com and other vendors, and even if amazon is a couple bucks more, i recommend using amazon. the customer service is so easy and immediate it's worth the piece of mind.i'll update this review when i get the new amp later this week.i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received...see below... 5
d'addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around. i've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass, electric and acoustic guitar, irish bazouki, mandolin, irish tenor banjo, 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my serbian brach always with stellar results. when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldn't be hype. i was right. i strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago & have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio. i've never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3- 45 minute sets but these did. and i was sober so it wasn't just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune. not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when i played it. of course that wouldn't mean a thing if they didn't feel good on the fingers. they do. like they were custom made for your guitar. they were on my rickenbacker so i can't honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but i strongly suspect they would. not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp & new. i'm going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good.  i usually change my strings every other week when i'm playing regularly so i'm already passed my regular limit. i may update this review in a month or so when i know how long they lasted. most highly recommended! 5
don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. i think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and i had to throw in new batteries. but if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip. 3
these are nice,and this was easily the best price around. these are made in japan, and i believe they're made for fender by gotoh, so they're good quality. but i was annoyed that they ( the bushings) didn't fit the "standard,vintage-sized" .340" holes in my all-parts neck ( they're a little large).so be aware of that. 3
these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. i feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. and they look professional too. 5
what's not to love about these strings? the sound is fantastic ... they ring like they should. but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long. 5
i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john  view tips and guidelines | headline & 20 more words required./// 5
this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right.  i like to ride my bike and take my uke along. the small size means it fits my panniers just fine.  the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes.  the larger foam/nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don't fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well.  highly recommended for the adventurous uke player. 5
i use this for my rockband microphones but be careful , if you have cats the hair will get stuck in it. other than that it really works well in taking away some of the echo from loud speakers while playing rockband. 5
this is a great package for beginners. i never played a ukelele before but i learned to play guitar many years ago.  i have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so i downloaded an app called "easy ukelele" available in amazon and google playstore for free.  that is the only ukelele tuner i can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. i purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so i have not yet preview the dvd and cd that came with it. i did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.my review:1. the package: the box comes with the ukelele, beginners manual, dvd, cd, carry pack, and 2 extra set of ukelele strings. tuner is not included so i advise that you either buy a tuner or download the "easy ukelele" app i mentioned above.2. the ukelele:  the ukelele looks and feels decent. it has a sticker that says made in china. it comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  i tuned it using the app i downloaded but it would not hold a tune. it is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  since the string is nylon, i gave it a chance to settle. i would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  i actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so i can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. the tuner pegs stays in place so i know that the problem is with the string.  it could be that the string included is a cheap one.  after doing this a few time on day 1, i was able to play my first song i grabbed from the book (clementine).  but after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  i just repeat what i did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. yesterday morning i tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when i came back in the afternoon, i checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key i left them in the morning. i played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and i was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  this morning, i checked the note again and they stay close to the g-c-e-a range. i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. even if i have to tune it every day  i would not have any problem with it.so, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. this are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. if it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  that is an easy fix.2. the string: as i mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. even if you buy a  good quality strings, i am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. it comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. the problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  from some research i found online they said that the thinnest string will be the a string. the second thinnest is the e string, the thickest is the c string and the second thickest is the g string. the extra string package says "gangia brand" on it so i assumed that that is the brand of the string.3. the book: i just scanned the book and i could tell that it is written well for beginners. the songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. each song have a chart on which chord you will use.4. the case:  the case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.5. the dvd's and cd's: i have not tried the dvd and cd's yet but the dvd's i believe will have the lesson and the cd will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. i will come back and edit this item once i get the chance to watch the dvd and listen to the cd.overall. this is a great price for the package. 5
first wax i have bought. i usually don't wax. i tend to use cleaning sprays. i am going to be waxing now on. gerlitz makes this wax easy, not greasy. this tin should last a lifetime. it comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars. i would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze. leaves no ffingerprints or smudges. my classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the gerlitz gno no 1 carnuba guitar wax!!!!! 5
this works perfect with the quick release system i also purchased. i mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap. it also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare, or want to put it away without loosing it. 4
i use this clamped to a table and it's a superb product. i have a 7&#34; tablet, and a 9.7&#34; touchpad, and they both work very well in it. nice mount. great value. buy it. 5
if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a poorly engineered pedal.  it can't be "true bypass" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  the tone becomes duller, the output drops.  i would expect that from an asian knock-off, not from an a-list gear maker.  i might be over-stating ernie ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars i gotta say, and i've used their strings for many years.if you plan to use this eb-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  this is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  the signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (not "true bypass" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  i will need to try that out, but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility.  major fail on their part.2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple "first do no harm" principle. it harms your tone.  how dumb is that?  the pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though i have my doubts about their "string" mechanism over time.  the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.i have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  because of the feel, and esthetics, i do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver. 2
you can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand ,your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it you'll like it ! 5
fender original parts can't be beat. the philips head is an improvement over the &#34;vintage&#34; straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish. these look like the have a nickel plating and i believe are 8-18, or 6-18 size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store, but i chose fender original parts for the tele i recently finished and for the one i am currently working on. 5
sorry, but i'm not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers. it's okay; good size, works pretty well, but sheds when new. and despite claims of being laundry-safe, the edges began to unravel after the first wash. i used with planet waves restore polish and got good results, but probably would not buy again. 3
i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself.a couple of secrets to installing the mike pickup:after you drill the hole, and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar, do this;get a guitar/patch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole. jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable. you may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth, so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help. also, i did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy, as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothing.finding a sweet spot on smaller guitars/ukulele/mandolin's can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small, you can't get your hand in, and finger length is as far as you can go, so in most cases, go in the direction of the low e string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have jimi hendrix hands and in that case, congratulations.finally, on travel guitars; get rid of the giant strings that come on some of these things!my sx traveller came in with 11-54's and i could not even hear the low e string. i had an old set of electric 10-46's i took off of a bb king lucille, and just for the heck of it swapped them out; man what a difference; actually so much difference that i really didn't need the axl i just installed even though it's a fun addition.as far as an amp, i have a little honeytone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal, and just may have found a home, as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the travel guitar. 5
but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with.  use a plugin instead.  i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed.  this particular unit is not one of their finest products but i give them credit for the price point and effort.  someone will appreciate it but not me.  it sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as it's not defective but just not up to what i want.  cheap, so no big loss. 3
as i mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. enough said. it does its job and does it ok for my taste. 5
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made.  but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected.  i give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  they are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. i bought one behringer xm8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  however, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal sm-58's are busy at another job.  i honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the behringers.  at one time alice cooper and his band were using the behringer xm8500's, however they may have moved on now for all i know.these are not shure sm-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  they have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  they are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  it also is if anything more versatile than the sm-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an sm-57 to pick up.  it doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the sm-58.  it has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  another strength of these is durability.  my 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  no damage at all to any of them!  i used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now i just shrug. one weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. if you want sm-58's you need to buy sm-58's.  if you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  no on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the sm-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  i don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  you can pay more and get less. 4
i use it with an audio technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording. not much else to say. 5
i bought a rogue mandolin from a friend (who bought from amazon but did not have time to even play it) for only 25$, still brand new, never played.i have owned and played many other mandolins (about a dozen), this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills. the mandolin is not playable in its brand new state (not in tune, action too high, lower action will result in string buzzes). and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup. i went thru all the necessary steps (almost like a luthier would do) and it came out sweet. it now has very low action, no string buzz, very good intonation. one can find info about mandolin setup on the web. it's quite tedious work.this will be my beater mandolin, at 25$, nothing can beat it.it stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re-tune. so this is more than adequate for daily practice. often times, it even stay in tune the next days. i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one. the finish on this model has some blemish (some small black spots on top the sunburst color), but only if you look really close, i would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred, at less than 40$, no problem at all.of course, this mandolin is no match for more expensive models/brands (such as kentucky) but i gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance / cost ratio.if you don't know how to setup mandolin, then be prepared to pay 60$ to 80$ for a professional setup (which is a must, otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune). some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge (that's unfair). all brand new mandolins require setup (at this expense), unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it.if you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free, that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this !!! 5
are hard to beat when it comes to durability. (except the steel ones).  i use it when i travel on a plane especially 4
the size of this makes it awesome for carrying around and it all works great. i have it custom mapped for multiple softwares. i love the product and all the features for the price. my only problem is, is that the usb plug on the controller becomes lose very quickly after moderate use. this is actually a huge problem, once the plug stops working your out of a controller. i would recommend this controller for home use and to leave the plug in the controller and do touch unless you have to. when unplugging it just be careful and it'll last a lot longer. the price on amazon is awesome. 3
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order.  i can always use guitar picks, however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel. 5
a needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. my only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway. 4
wow!  this is the pedal to own.  there are a lot of good pedals out there, but this one has that original, bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from 70's quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps. just amazing! if you don't have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal, this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine. a great purchase and built like a tank. 5
this is just your typical nylon strap (a bit stiff, but durable).  i love the celtic design enough to use this strap, but ordinarily i prefer higher quality materials than the nylon and plastic construction (with leather ends).  the leather is also a bit stiff, but not so stiff that it's not functional or reliable.  if dunlop made this in cotton and steel, i'd pay 4x as much for it... 3
the planet waves capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did. i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos. i used this capo on a gibson j40, hummingbird and a j-200. i played it finger style and strummed with a pick. the device is very well made and really looks like the best capo i own. however, the sound left something to be desired. there was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless, unless  i really cranked down on the adjustment - then is was still dull, but passable. it was a little better on electrics - i tried it on a les paul and a telecaster - it was ok, but not the best of the bunch. i do like the built in pick holder. to compare this i tried a g7 capo, kaiser and schubb. frankly, the only one i really am happy with is the schubb. 3
hey i got this and an "ovation idea" from go-dps. i couldnt be happier with these items, especially the "ovation idea" !!!!!!i have to brag on "go-dps" some, they are wonderfull dealers; i look forward to buying from go-dps again. 5
ok, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. i've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. there is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. however, i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. i also really like the nylon material. it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. i like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. i keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be. 5
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician.  three big ones are the jet sound, choral/flange and leslie speaker! 5
who cares if they were used or hanging around the warehouse hey they went together and don't show any wear and tear to me...love them...thanks 5
this inexpensive capo works as advertised. it's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup. 4
i ordered them because they are carbon fiber, but love them because i don't loose picks anymore! i used to lose a pick every other day. bought six, still have six a week later. :)here's how i keep it: about midway over the fretboard, slide it between the e, b, and g strings (the three smallest strings) and slide it up towards the headstock. it has little gecko-like protrusions that grip the e string. stays in place and cannot slip out. wonderful! 5
there was nothing wrong with my original neckplate, but i was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra.  it was a direct replacement for the original. 5
simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end.  appropiately priced.  good value.  not fancy, but who needs a fancy strap for a $90 guitar?  arrived before projected delivery date. the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use.  takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar. 3
stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal. i read the reviews and decided to give it a chance; how could i lose at this price? i put it in my cart and continued shopping.guess what...the reviewers weren't lying (except that one guy who gave it a 2..what a bs review)!it arrived today, and i decided to give it a quick workout. i grabbed a small amp (fender frontman 15) and plugged in my strat (with a seymour duncan hotrail at the bridge) and gave it a go. the 'quick workout' turned into an hour long jam session as i got caught up in what this pedal can do. it turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather! with the mic at off x, middle set at hot, and california and 3/4 gain...this thing just screams for solos and is very heavy for rhythm. i spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away.the tweed and brit settings were great too, as i tweaked a multitude of tones from this beast. i've had behringer pedals before and even though they were decent (vintage delay, slow motion, compressor, eq), i didn't get excited about them. in fact, i sold the delay and slow mo recently. this pedal however, is going to get some serious use. i'm not crazy about the plastic casing, but it seems sturdy enough. i can't recommend this pedal enough...the reviews were right! you won't be sorry. 5
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations. when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it. 5
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.size and fit were good. the storage compartment is nice and large.one hinge broke after about a year of normal use. it was in the house almost the whole time, i just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done. i noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.this was not an expensive guitar, and i had a better case, so i switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that i really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage. 3
how many times did i tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided i didn't need chorus at all. this pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. i even like it with the bass. just a great chorus with not much to tweak. 5
works very well.  i have to of them.  each does a little different thing,  they are great for traveling, or late night need to play stuff, when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better.  the sound, effects, etc., are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication. 4
sold, great quality xlr mic. it's pretty hard to mess these up. people often build their own, but when they're this cheap, why go through the trouble? 5
i love this thing and for the price you just can't beat it. it seems sturdy and i have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up. i haven't tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my 7 electric guitars very nicely. set up only took about 10 min or so and it included all the tools necessary. i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for $60 more. like i said, for the price you can't beat it. 5
i don't have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes, but enough to know when i have a winner. behringer's tm300 is made from tough plastic. the 3 other beheringers i have had about a year don't look warn and scarred, and sound as good as the day i got them. the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones. fender clean, bright, british crunch and distortion, a hot  gain and sweet smooth california sound.  i am playing out of a peavey, but i hear a tweed. amazing clarity, and worth the $28 and change. you won't be disappointed. 5
i love this tuner! its awesome to use and efficient! the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are. to my ear it sounds good but you never know??? 5
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked.  they don't play at all like what i was expecting.  under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old jazz iii either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  what's up with that?i'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop.  let's hope this is just a short-term fluke. 2
this strap works fine on my fender strat.  it is reasonably comfortable.  i was disappointed in that it does not fit the pegs of my zager acoustic.  otherwise,  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap. 4
this is an interesting, limited effect pedal. i bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. on a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. however, i play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.this pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. it's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. i combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.i tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. for chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. i haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as i normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well. 4
this is a really nice strap.  it's very thick and feels like it's well made and high quality for a non-bank breaking price on a strap.  looks cool and vintage, i am a fan of many dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all. 5
what a great price and product!  bought two of these so i can keep my guitars handy and i love them.  really love having the rubber strap to secure the neck in the event of a mishap.  the wide frame legs make the stand extremely sturdy and love that it can come apart easy if i want to pack it up. 5
ok i don't have much to say, just i love it because its cheap nice and i don't know i just feel happy to buy this product 5
this mighty bright is  great!!!!  it clips to my music stand, has battery power or ac adapter ( included) and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare. if you need a light for reading music or for just reading, this is it......... 5
very nice tone, very nice metal sound, very crunchy and deep. well worth it for the price, on par with other way more expensive pedals. definetly buy the power supply with it though, it just makes it better and easier to use. very nice product overall 5
i am a fan of joyo-  i own the vintage od, the ultimate drive, the sweet baby, the us dream,  the crunchbox clone, and this one.  this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal.  i'm giving it 3 stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap, but the octive leaves much to be desired.  i have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue.  apparently, one of the components is installed in a reversed positon, which results in the lackluster octive.  i haven't taken mine apart for the fix, but i read that it's just unsolder, flip, and resolder the same component.  you can google it for better instructions.  still, this ain't bad for the pocket change they charge.  the reason i haven't fixed it yet is i have the feeling that once i mod it, it will sound just like my dano french toast- albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass- 3
these cables are very good quality. i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage. they are good quality, and very durable. 5
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly. that's all there really is to say, if you need a sturdy guitar case  for a les paul styled guitar and don't want to spend a butt-load of money, look no further. 5
after registering the amp online (or by mail) you have access to 500+ backing tunes,with either drums or drums and bassline. you are able to select from different genres such as rock, blues, country, alternative and more. along with this great feature, you can also take free lessons, from beginner to advanced. you can even get custom settings, giving you the sound of such great bands as green day, the beatles, led zeppelin and many more. along with lessons, tabs, and the ability to loop any jam track, spider online adds more than even i immagined to this awesome amp!! if you're still hesitant about buying this or any other spider amp, just buy it. i personally guarantee your satisfaction...buy it!! (no seriously, are you buying it??) 5
arrived promptly.  nicely packaged.  holding my instruments securely.  i'll likely order more, and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts. 4
i needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and i am pretty happy with them.. they could have been a litte taller, howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money.  you could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra.  i would buy more if i needed them. 4
i admit it, my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick. hold my tab securely so i can flip though it with ease while i'm still playing my guitar. much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage. 5
this will work for just about everyone...but i prefer the walker williams brand...but these work fine easy to get strap locks on...will keep on the side for next guitar...you shouild be happy. enjoy 4
this cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. would like to purchase another one in the future. buy it! it's worth it 5
best strap locks ive ever used, dunlop has always had great products.easy to install and i highly recomend them to any bass player 5
this little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand, but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even. its 1/4" ts plug goes directly into your bass's instrument cable jack, and it has one 1/8" trs output jack for your headphone plug. but it also has a second 1/8" trs input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp3 player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over play-alongs or any such music source, both directly into your headphones.its on-off switch has a third position for overdrive distortion, which i never use. it has both gain and volume output controls and both work. it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything. could be that i just have a defective sample, but i don't care because the tone is fine just as it is.others have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile, and i don't argue with that--it does feel a bit thinly made and the 2xaaa battery door does seem weak. but i just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag. if the battery door eventually falls off, i'll use duct tape, and when this little thing completely wears out, i'll buy another. it's just too handy and easy to travel with not to own--and, as i said, it does the job.edit 2013-04-07: still working fine. 5
might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  i'm opting for the convenience of the size.  i got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  i like the 'brit' setting.  i sound like a rock star with it.  good product for practice or recording.  you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  but for around the same price you could get a fender amp.  this product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this. 5
this a very clever idea. it helps save floor space in your rooms, and it helps cover empty wall space. very easy to take off/put on. high recommend this to any stringed-instrument players. 5
i wanted to wait till i got another phono preamp before i wrote this review. i did get this from amazontc 754 black phono preamplifier switchablei really needed more aux inputs for cd etc. but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright. the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others. i am using a vintage garrard turntable. the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp. they are tight but do not make good contact and i need to mess with them. this problem is gone with the new preamp. overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues. if you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where. it does sound ok other than being a little bright. it does do what is supposed to do. 3
definitely worth the $40. if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this ain't it. this is a good old school fuzz monster, and when combinations of notes are played, most notably an interval of a 4th on the lower strings it creates an overtone series that has a subtle octving effect. i've used this pedal to put some growl in my bass, kind of an e.h. bass balls sound. 5
i bought a few of these to hook ipods/iphones to live stage sound systems, most of which are not in stereo anyway, so why use stereo-to-mono adapters or 2 separate channels when it's not needed? perfect solution, seems durable. 5
i'm now have my music together, great for small space &#34;does it works&#34; limit to one mic, but enogh for me. 5
it is not the size for mini guitar. may be for the big one...connections are shaky. you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low. 2
needed something to allow the strap on the guitar to be removed for ease of operation during playing.  this filled the bill, works on basically any type of guitar.  it just hooks around the neck and ties into the strap, and has a quick release. 4
i have been using these strings for the last 7 years.  the tone last longer than any other string and they don't break on me.  in those 7 years i haven't broke a single string.  that being said i don't play heavy at all.  i will buy these strings until the day i die. especially the acoustic version of these... 5
the danelectro fab  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  the d-4 slap echo effects pedal works great and gives me that old tube amp reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  there's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  this series of pedals ( fab ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  danelectro offers more expensive units but i don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  you can't go wrong with this product, danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great... 5
simply one of the best string winders i have ever used to date and i love it because i having large hands it really makes a difference. not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot. very good. 5
considering that the sm57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the shure sm58lc shure sm58 vocal microphone, i guess the 58 gets batman status, relegating the 57 to that of robin. but that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.the sm (studio microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. in that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the sm58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. so the sm57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.one of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the white house. a pair of sm57's is always seen on various white house podiums for press conferences and there is even a vip bundled kitshure sm57 vip dual microphone kityou can buy for this exact type of use.the sm57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. that's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. and on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.there is a performer seriesshure beta 57a microphonethat looks very similar to the sm57 but the beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. so make sure you try before you buy.bottom line is the shure sm57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. a best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians. 4
i bought these because they were an &#34;add-on&#34; offer and i'm glad i did.  i don't play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass. these are a little too soft for guitar (check out the dunlops) but i'm going to make sure i have some of these around, too. 4
i really like this strap.  i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar.  they're really comfortable.  they're much less bulky than most of the leather straps i've seen, so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case.i've had the original blue one i bought for about 3 years and it still looks and functions like new. 5
this is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight.  i don't have a bass, however, it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar. 5
i'm glad i tried these, i wont order them again. i thought they might be a good alternate for my dunlop nylon picks, not really though.edit: im nothing if not fair. my last review of these was in the context of my playing my strat or sometimes my 335. i stand by that review. however, now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. in the end these are the picks i reach for when im playing the godin.i will buy these again. i changing my review from 'just okay' to "contextually perfect". ok i'll add a star, your right i should add a star. there! 4
the mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped. there was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke. i tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs.i removed the pick guard because i really didn't like how it looked and it looks fine without it. the strings that come with it work fine and none snapped. even if you end up not wanting to play it, you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than i would have expected. the only problem i have is that the two g chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly. i got this because i really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap. also, another difficulty i had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on. if you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out. 5
at one point i had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat, but then i smartened up, worked my calluses to the point where i could probably play 13-62's tuned to e with no trouble, and realized that these strings worked great for my strat, because of the strong tone that these provide, and ease of bending on the upper frets. these strings also are good for les pauls, where the scale length is shorter than the fender guitars, making bending like velvet. 5
whether you're a beginner, or have been playing for a long time, you can never go wrong with ernie ball strings. 5
i bought one of each soft, medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the hard is as soft as the soft. they felt exactly the same in fact. the medium was the hardest out of the bunch.packaging error? i have no idea. the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. so check with what you get.sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming.the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead. 1
it is very easy to apply, great results and very little effort. i'm surprised by the results. never got this shine in my guitar with any other product. 5
these fender locking tuners are the best for stratocaster guitars, mainly if you have a tremolo system, what helps a lot the tuning stability and speeds up the strings change. 5
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 2
i already use the exl111 as my go-to electric string and tried these as part of the vine program.  i have to say i really couldn't feel the difference.  from what i can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the d string gauge is .25, whereas the same string in the exl111 set is .24.  since the string construction and plating is the same, i have to assume these will have the same longevity. i guess as long as both are still available (exl111 being phased out?) i will be selecting solely on price.  either way you can't go wrong as d'addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price. 5
i expected this to come with a dc adapter. nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn't be any or i could have ordered one. the product is good, surprisingly loud. the bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles (once the battery popped out by itself when i played a low e) but that's no issue. i have only used it with a 9v battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain. i hope that doesn't happen with an adapter. it's a nice little amp, good for carrying around. if you have long fingers, you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it's height - it's that small! a guitar strap, a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it. the distortion it gives is good. not good for palm muting. this is nice for practising randy rhoads, the doors -type of rock where not many effects are used.also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner -. many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one. it's easy to change the polarity, open the box of the adapter and exchange (needs soldering, obv) the red and the black wire places! 4
i was skeptical after reading the reviews, but the manufacturer must have read the same reviews because these things are solid and the glue that holds the rubber piece seems to be holding up well. no issues with the screw not tightening either. i plan to buy more of these in the near future. 5
hosa makes good stuff, this is no exception. i've trusted them for years, i can't think if a single hosa cable i've owned that's failed. 5
if you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my ipad left me with choosing between the iriffport and the jam.  i recently purchased, and then returned, the iriffport.  i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement.  here are the reasons why:1) the connector on the iriffport (the one that goes into the ipad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time.  i have a stand to put my ipad on when jamming such that the ipad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way.  with the apogee jam, the connector is just like the ipad's connector, except it also has the "prongs" that come out of it, securing the connector into the ipad.  to remove the connector from the ipad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the "prongs" go in so it can be removed...very, very secure.  i use the "gumdrop" case on my ipad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used.  this flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used.  important:  if you have such an ipad case, like me, i certainly feel that the jam will provide a much more secure connection to your ipad over the iriffport.  in fact, the structure of the iriffport connector was so large, that i felt that it did not fit well through my case.  on the other hand, the jam's connector is the same small size as the ipad's original connector.  this is also something to consider if you intend to use your ipad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the ipad.2) probably the largest reason i prefer the jam over the iriffport:  you can hear sound directly from the ipad.  with the iriffport, you must use headphones or attach external speakers.  i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward.  nonetheless, with the jam, i could attach headphones or external speakers to the ipad if i chose to do so.  i wanted something that could make my ipad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers.  with the jam, i have this.3) the jam has a gain meter (i.e., an led) and a gain control.  the iriffport does not.  when not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the led lets you know if you are connected to the ipad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the ipad and to a software application (green light).  there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport.4) i personally like that i can use my own guitar cord with the jam.  if the cord breaks, i simply replace the cord, not my ipad connection device.  the iriffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my "normal" guitar cable i used with the jam.5)  although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the jam is advertised by apple (look at their website and their garageband video).  and, since i have garageband on my ipad, i was pleased to see that the advertising material on the jam states specifically that it works with garageband.so far, i'm very pleased with the jam. 5
by definition, medium is an in between size. but when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. on that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. for me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. i don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. but i do have periods where i will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. for me, these light-medium are exactly where i want my strings to be.if you like martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. i don't feel i am missing anything compared to the medium. if i had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, i would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. but without that, i don't think i'd notice the difference with normal listening. with the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.if martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste. 5
i purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100% accurate and very easy to use.  his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use.  i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner.  he connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp.  if you are a beginner or seasoned player i know you will like an appreciate the tuner.  a must to keep in your bag especially for beginners, a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on. 5
i've had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone. right out of the box, the hd 500 totally blew me away. i know their marketing calls it "hd" because of the added tonal characteristics, and it's true - there is a huge difference between the hd series and the older pods. i can't really say why they sound better, but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older pods without much tweaking and no eqing (although one can tweak the tone with several eqs).one complaint with the older pods (that i agree with) was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone. this is not the case with the hd 500. i've been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work.at first, i purchased theline 6 pod hd 300because i didn't see the value of the hd 500. after thinking about it, i decided to pick up the hd 500 and compare the two pedals. i definitely think the hd 500 is worth the extra cash, even for a hobbyist such as myself. there are extra controls on the looper, and extra record time. the wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the 500s (i could be wrong, but i do remember them being different). the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd 500 are amazing. i'm sure i'm forgetting some differences, but i know i'm happy that i went with the hd 500 over the hd 300.the drivers seem to work great on both windows 7 pro 64-bit and mac os 10.6 (they have 64-bit mac drivers now). the included software is ok - i get the feeling they are still building it out. it's a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part. the software updater works great and i've already had a couple of firmware updates since i purchased the hd 500 (bug fixes). there is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct "tube amp feel and behavior".i nearly purchased the m13 to plug into myfender super champ xd electric guitar amplifier, but i noticed the hd 500 had the same number of effects plus amp modelling for the same price! i know the two pedals are designed for different purposes, but for me the hd 500 made much more sense. i can use it to practice with headphones, or plug into my amp as an effects pedal. to use it as an effects only pedal, one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup. i also decided to test playing the hd 500 directly into abehringer eurolive b215d active 550-watt 2-way pa speaker system with 15-inch woofer and 1.35-inch compression driver, which may replace my other amps as my primary rig (i get the behringer today, so we'll see).the build quality over the pod x3 live has improved. the case is now entirely metal vs. a combination of metal and plastic. i can definitely see this being heavy road/gig worthy. i also purchased agator gk2110 compact keyboard gig bag, which fits the hd 500 (albeit very snugly).overall i'm very happy with this setup, and recommend this amp modeler/effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home (especially with headphones) on a wide variety of musical styles. 5
i've owned a half-dozen led music stand lights over the years. this one puts them all in the shade (pun intended; sorry).the 9-led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern. the light is concentrated in the desired area and doesn't spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights. the little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when it's pointed back at the music. the light is two-level: normal and bright! normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater. the fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of stand-light bulbs is a definite plus. if you need to put a color filter over it, you don't have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter. the light spread is so smooth and consistent that i don't have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with two-head stand lights.the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well. the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights. the included zipper case is fairly big and bulky, but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag. it has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries, a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light, and a small pocket for the ac adapter. it's hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket, but there's plenty of room for it in the case. i don't know about battery life yet, but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the ac adapter (usually an optional purchase).this light is a bit large compared to other led stand lights, but it's so good that i don't really care. i've gotten years of service from mighty bright lights, and i expect the same from this. even if this one doesn't last, i'll keep buying more. 5
i use this item for my daughter 1/2 size guitar, its looks light in weight and firm, and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars. 5
actually they're not fender, they are schaller, but that is really good!. looks great in my fender squier. highly recommended! 5
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck. great sound and flexible. i'm a firm hosa cable fan. love these little guys. 5
it does the job to do my home made music demos, nothing professional though. im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes. 5
i am a confessed and unrepentant hoarder of dirtboxes and i like this pedal a lot.  this is my 5th joyo pedal- i already own the ultimate drive, vintage overdrive, crunch distortion, and octive fuzz pedals.  i consider joyo and the dano cool cat line to be some of the best values in stomp-boxes these days.  you've already heard the particulars about this pedal, so i won't go into the features.  the build quality does appear to be a hair shoddier than all my other joyo pedals (which are earlier versions).  the switch seems a little less heavy-duty, and the case seems to be thinner metal.  that said, the case is still metal and isn't going to fail in any way.  the switch- well, we will have to wait and see.  for $35 or so, i'm not going to complain.  soundwise, this product offers excellent gain for this price level.  it's not particularly suited for pantera, but you can do modern mid-gain up to metallica without any problems.  this is not an overdrive, so it doesn't do the 'just on the verge of breakup' thing like a tubescreamer does.  that's not what it was designed to do.  i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good.  i've also boosted it with the following with a good result:  sd pickup booster, cool cat transparent overdrive, tubescreamer (ts9,joyo vintage od, behringer to800), tech 21 comptortion.  if you play rock/ hard rock through a single channel amp (like a blues jr, valve jr or pro jr) and you want to make it a two channel amp, this will get you there. most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot.  i do not own that pedal, so i can not fairly make a comparison.  i have seen several videos comparing the two and as far as that is concerned, i hear enough similarity that i am not compelled to shell out $200 for the riot. another comparison that gets made is that the us dream is close to a proco rat.  i own an original 80s rat and i don't think they are all that similar.  the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble.  not better or worse- just different enough that they don't completely cover the same sonic territory.  admitedly, i don't own a newer rat-  maybe that one is closer to the us dream.  for what they are charging, this is another home run for joyo- 5
i have used these type of clip on tuners for quite some time and have 4 different brands.the snark however is absolutely the best clip on tuner i've seen on the entire market and the price isperfect. they've come out with the sn-8 i hear, which i'll buy soon..great product..don't leave home without it. 5
i've been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. i figured i'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.these were the first to go on, and they were a huge step down from what i had on. the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high e string. they were twice as loud as these. when you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. they don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. the cons definitely outweigh the pros here.pros:-very flexible, string bends are easy-easy on the fingerscons:-the most dull sound of any strings i've ever heard. especially on the low end. they're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. the highs are very tinny. almost sounds like a bad recording.-your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. it's the weirdest thing. this is especially true for the g string. it's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. anyways, it sucks. grip is the last thing you want on your strings.bottom line: unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. i'll never buy again. this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings. 2
good product! but i'd expected more robust on your structure. but it's good product! don't have adhesive to bind on the surface. 4
these are good heads. i have played them on several drum sets and have been pleased with their sound, look and feel. this is a super solid price too. 4
i like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. the red color is a metallic color - and i totally dig it. the display is nice and bright as well. super accurate tuning. well worth it for the price. 5
i have used many clip-on guitar tuners. they are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on. i have several of them and use them often on many guitars. based on this experience, i was anticipating a better experience with this new mini headstock tuner than i wound up getting.it tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. others found it awkward to attach - i did not. it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. those are not problems. what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.this fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.the fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the planet waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. this clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and i expect it to break after only a short time. consequently, i cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.if the need is for a tuner that attaches to one instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. if you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of planet waves tuners.november 28,2011 updatehaving used this tuner for a while now, i have found that it has a good purpose. while this tuned does have mobility issues as i initially noted, i have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. i leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. a non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. based on this belated realization, i have raised the product rating to 4-stars. 4
rugged pedal by a little known company. took a shot in the dark, hit a bullseye! great univibeish/old chorus device. would like to see stereo output options in future models. solid. if you have a strat, have studied jimi, then it will suit you well if you've got the right physical approach to the guitar itself. 5
perhaps more than anything else, it was the introduction and subsequent success of the zoom h2 personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles, who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi-professional-level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user-friendly equipment at reasonable prices.  the price of the samson meteor usb mic, a fairly recent entry, has come down to the point of being fairly valued (initially, i was seeing it going for prices above the better-sounding blue yeti mic).  it's an attractive (some would say "cute") little mic with its quaint "retro" design and deceptively fold-up, portable size.  i say "deceptive" because, due to the non-adjustable mic stand, it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop, next to a computer, and squarely in front of the narrator's mouth.bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound (it's good, but nowhere close to studio-quality), it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking "high fidelity" audio to spend the extra 20% for a blue yeti or an audio technica at2020 usb (as tempting as the lower price of the non-usb version of the at2020 is, be sure to try it out with a pre-amp supplying phantom power before going that route.  i've known a couple of individuals who ordered the at2020 condenser mic, only to discover that it was useless with a computer, even with the addition of a snake light cable).if your primary considerations are convenience and portability, the samson go mic sounds almost as good as the meteor and is unmatched in size, convenience and portability.  (it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions.)  i'm tempted to say it's the perfect laptop mic, clipping to the top cover more securely than the snowflake, whereas the yeti is ideal for desktop use, producing rich-sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio's shure sm7b mics. 4
i'm primarily a guitarist, but i keep an inexpensive sx bass around for when i'm self-recording and whatnot.  since it isn't my primary instrument and i don't play bass live (well, not yet), it never made sense to invest in a bass amp.  i bought this to liven up the tone when recording, in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface.  it does the job; makes the sound warmer and more amp-like.honestly, if you've been doing some homework about this thing, you should know what to think of it.  behringer's build quality can be dubious sometimes, but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn't a picky audiophile.  this box is no exception.  i've never personally played through a sansamp, but i would hazard a guess that if you know that's what you want, this won't satisfy you.  if you want something like a sansamp you could do a lot worse than venture the 30-some bucks on this little box.to my ears, it sounds quite good.  get it if it fills a need for you and you're broke.  knocked off a star for behringer's usual build quality, although mine hasn't broken from gentle use yet. 4
until 5-6 years ago there was a virtual void in high-quality personal digital recorders.  then the zoom h2 came along, and numerous variations on a theme were soon to follow.  i've owned both the h2 and the h1 and, though both have their strong points, the tascam dr-05 has served me better than either. the h2 has pleasing 4-point sound and the h1, at half the size of the tascam, works well for "stealth" as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera.  but both recorders are more complicated than necessary, with tricky menu systems, excessive tiny buttons (6 on one thin side of the h1), and dicey build quality.the tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine that's a pleasure to use.  there are no shaky, rattling parts, the controls are solid and instantly solved (easily manageable with a single thumb), and the wide-spread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music (for dictation, i use a separate, small mic inserted in the topside input).  the machine reminds me of the far costlier sony pcm-50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation. the tascam's 320 kbps mp3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically "present" than its 96/24 wav files, and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum.  if you don't have $500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for day-in, day-out use, this is the one. 5
these are solid, good build quality and really do get the job done well.easily adjustable, versatile in design and function, get em! 5
i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq. i did have to sand to make it fit. that may sound badm but i am glad because it's better than too small. i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering. 5
picked up this set of cords for a gig i had at a large hotel event.  there were 3 audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages.  we had 48 channels  running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board, the video mix board, and then the house mix board. i had returns a-e for my subwoofer, 3 monitor mixes and a stereo main mix.  i used a different color cable for each function. i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars, bass and keyboards.  all of the cables worked perfectly! the video mix guy asked me where i got the cables from so he could get a set for himself. these cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear down.already had 2 sets, so i ordered one more set for my studio, so i can find connections that much easier!great set of cables! 5
these are high quality thick guitar picks. the colors are great. unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging. i know the company is trying to save money, but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive. almost didn't know what it was because of this. just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail. 4
i purchased these for my little pedal board "the stepping stone".these are very well made with the heads well secured. the plastic is thick and of a nice material.the cables come with a massive 5 year warranty so i'm sure they're not going bad anytime soon.buy with confidence. 5
it's ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected.  i would recommend going a little higher price.  it also arrived cracked. 3
yes, dear reader, this stand will work as a good support stand for not only my grand concert size acoustic guitar, for  my five- string banjo (with resonator), and.also  for my baritone ukulele.  the stand is.sturdy, provides good support, and looks good.  i am pleased with my purchase. and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo. the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container.. 5
this tuner is amazing, even more so considering the price. it's chromatic, so it will tune anything! i tune electric and acoustic guitars, bass, ukulele and mandolin with it! i've bought three for gifts... it's great.sooooo, everything i said initially is still true... it's a fantastic little tuner... but i've broken two of them. (where the clip attaches to the tuner - as in a multitude of other reviews...)this tuner *is* amazing... but fragile! 3
i just received these cables today and the packaging they come in is quite simple. however, there are two zip ties that secure the cables together so you will need to be careful when cutting them not to damage the cable itself with your knife or scissors.these are, "value" cables after all. however, they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use. i like how audio technica made something like an xlr cable look so pleasing to the eyes.as for quality, so far i've been getting a clean signal, even with my cheap pyle pro pdmic58. i had to replace the cable that came with that mic because it was really that awful. hopefully the at value cable will hold up! i'll update this review if anything happens.if your looking for a decent cable for a low price, i would give these a try. 5
i bought these to try them out. i have used remo a little then i used to have some aquarian heads and wanted to try evans to see how they are. amazing. i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up. my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them. 5
a strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? it was about $5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine. it's comfortable and fits my bass well. i'm a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it. nice value. 5
i have been using this little amp very heavily for about a year now and highly recommend it.  the device is extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next to my mixer, it does exactly what i expect & the sound is clean.  works great - great price - meets my requirements perfectly. 5
far better than any light weight chrome stand, this has guts!  easily adjustible, knobs tighten easily and firmly.  good height adjustment for sitting or standing.  highly reccomend this stand! 5
don't panic, strings marked a/d/f#/b can be used just fine for g/c/e/a tuning... they don't seem to be quite as nice as the comparable aquilas, but they're half the price... they were for a $20 uke... (and yeah, new $4 strings do improve the sound on a $20 uke!). 4
i have run sound for several large churches, providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting. the way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different, especially when applying vocal effects. i have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years.the 80/20 rule says that if you can get 80% of the sound you're looking for with 20% of the work, be satisfied. this mic mechanic (mm) is more like 99% of the sound with 1% of the work.i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound. primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer.1) adaptive tone. the mm continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression, gate, eq, and de-essing. even when recording dry vocals, at a minimum, you should at least set your compression, then in post production, add parametric eq to place your vocals where they need to be set.now? i hit the tone button, and all that is done for me. it makes a dynamic mic sound great! it makes working with a condenser mic easier.2) reverb. most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb. they either use too much or too little. with this, when you it equally between wet and dry, you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life. i recorded a vocal with club, room, and hall reverb. each one sat just right! when you solo the vocals, you can tell which is used. in the mix it was more subtle. good job!3) pitch correction. i have to admit, my own vocals aren't perfect. when you record your own vocals, and you're like me, you'll hear a "chorus" sound in your headphones. that's because you're hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones. this takes a second to get use to.when set in the center, you can still do your vocal gymnastics, slide into notes, and it seems... natural. it pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale, so if you're way off, it will make your vocals sound out.i'm not a singer, but this has renewed my joy in singing! 5
bought two sets. both arrived together and at the expected delivery date. i had bought two sets of the pyle pro pmdk102 months previously which also included a pair of 25ft 1/4" cabling from an amazon dealer which arrived without problems. initially, i noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles. personally, i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103. later comparison showed that the pstk103 is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker pole.however, the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products. the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs. there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing. why i blame the manufacturer's packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple ... the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and side-by-side within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton, no other fore-thought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded. really, how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foam?!!!on the plus side ... after testing each of the tripod stands ... all seemed to function perfectly well. the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up. the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved ... i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy. only time and after some use hereafter will i be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain. 3
the yamaha keyboards that take batteries don't come with an ac power adapter. no problem. i got this the week after christmas and it works like it came with the keyboard. 5
a nice little amp to rock out with... so it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all i asked. 5
comes in a really nice case.  works great.  great price. very light.  can't speak to durability because haven't had them long and haven't used them heavily. 5
saw this sucker on my bass player's head, and got one a few days later. not pitch perfect on the fly, but keeps you very close when on the run. unbeatable value. silent tuning, so on stage it's almost a must. 5
apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  very stable.  the auto-locking heads rock!  folds-up pretty compact for travel.  the optional carry bag is a must imho. 5
i've always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work.  danny gatton did so, and i wouldn't have it any other way.  these are the absolute best picks i've ever used.  they don't wear down as easily as delrin, tortex, or some other materials.  and, these have a really, really nice textured surface that keeps them from slipping out of your fingers.  i think i'm going to order these in massive bulk quantities and stash them away in case they ever decide to stop manufacturing these... 5
i've used this stand for about two years now and it held up great. it does what it's supposed to do and for the price it's one of the best  thank you  and guess what  in  amazone  you can find it much cheaper than music store 5
this stand easily folds, and holds my mandolin in a scratch-proof stance.  not good for smaller instruments, like the name may imply to some.  an attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed, but everything from tenor uke and up, did just fine! :) 5
i use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out.  individual volumes controls make it perfect. 5
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.only thing i can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of it.it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.i was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.it seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor i ordered the product from.dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.they have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.this product as advertised did not come with any picks.if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately. 5
this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer, it works as expected and has proven to be durable.  i don't hesitate to drop it in my gig bag, knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show. 5
this is a well made table top stand. the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease. i would get this stand again. 5
this is a great strap. nice tight fit, snug and secure and very flexible. best part this strap gets long long long. yep here it is. 5
if you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal i had a boss ds 1 and metal zone mt 2 and did not like them much because they're so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me. it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you're looking for then this is for you. it offers rugged construction and true bypass. the only problem i have had is that unity gain is at around 9 o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone. 5
guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok.  will need to check them next week or so. 3
does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating 5
i own the older color bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one. i love the size, weight and led bulbs on this one though. it has a nice color throw too. it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but........this new led version is built with less quality. when you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings, the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one, about every second. they do not stop flashing when it's plugged in since it don't have an on/off switch. if you are using this on a switcher, then it wouldn't be a problem.i'd prefer the light to stop when the music stops, but it don't. when you try to adjust the audio flashing, it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation.also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back. they will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around. within 1 hour of getting it, i had to take it apart, push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place.i love the light but it's not as useful to me since it's "always" flashing. it's possible i have a defective one, not sure.the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light.***update,  i played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better. when you turn it all the down, the lights stopped flashing until the music started again. the one i have never stops flashing, even when the music stops. i guess i got a bad one. 3
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.so far, works well.sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. can tune up quickly every time. 5
i needed some little, easy, and portable guitar stands for the stage.  this does it perfectly, well.  while being light and portable. 5
i have a lot of pedals.... including many delays and echos...the mxr is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my aqua puss, eh delux memory boy, ibanez, boss, and lets not even get into the behringer stuff...  :)i like the chorus-like mod button.  very lush and sweet to listen too.  not as feature rich as some of my other delays, but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me.  simple to use, compact and well built.  i like using this clean... but even it's ability to take some distortion is pretty good.this is simliar to my favorite echo (the morely ecv from the 70's) in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it.  lush is the right word.hope this helps. 5
these screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black fender strat body. they are good quality screws. 5
these aren't my first set, i can't count the amount of monster 1/4 cables i bought and own. none has ever failed me so far. highly recommend these! i love how they sound and they are built well. 5
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele.  it's attractive.  it's well made. it's fork is a tad large for the ukulele  it has rubber o-rings that slide, so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then.  but then, even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase (or wall, if you use it there).  the uke hits when i put it in the hanger, so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase.many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners.  this is much less expensive, holds very well, is even more low profile than this hanger, and never drops a uke. consider it for your needs.i'd not buy another of these for a ukulele.  it likely works fine for a guitar, though.i deducted one point for the fact that, even though it's adjustable (the o-rings), and advertised for ukes, it doesn't work well for them.  and it's heavy and not stylish, in my opinion.  i have the hercules wall hanger (mechanical gripper) for my electric guitars, and it's fabulous (for guitars; overkill for lightweight ukuleles, maybe).hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp39wbupdate 9/7/11: the more i use it, the less i like it.  i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all, and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune.  so, for small instruments (you'd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos), this is atrocious.  for guitars, it's not as good as hercules. 3
i have had them on my loar guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine.  we will see how long they last.  i have used elixir for electric and while they do last longer i wish it was a bit longer. 4
these are super strings. they will last and last and last, and give you great sound. easy to put on and tune. 5
it sounds like it's behringer.  very fake, cheap sounding phaser, but it's all i need.  i got it mostly for that big airplane woosh, and running it in the loop, it does that fine.  the highs are kind of harsh, but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame. 3
i like the capo, only it seems a little stiff when opening it up to put it on or take it off.  it was actually a bronze color instead of gold, but that's not a big deal to me.  i'm interested on the durability of this, but for the price, how can you go wrong? 4
this pick is great for strumming. some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard. if you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip. 4
i love this product.  this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings.  no need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters.  for a modest rig, or on the road use, i recommend this product. 5
they all work and none of them have given any trouble. my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around (a lot). i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great. no regrets, rock on! 4
tried them all. these are the best sounding in my book. they last pretty long for non-coated strings and play nicely, too. 5
this stand is small but does the job.and folds up in to a small package.i have one for each guitar 5
i like this bag, though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured.  it's a bit too big for my tenor uke, it's most probably made for a baritone uke.all in all a good value for the money! 5
i bought one of snark's "super tight" tuners and found it to be less then advertised. it will get you in tune, but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less. i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio, and one on my stage rig. buy it. it's a great little tuner! 5
i use the chair for guitar, bass, keyboards,ukulele and even cooking breakfast. lightweight, slightly awkward, but provides good back support.as a right-handed player i practice, both classical and jazz style, with the guitar on my left knee. for the position i use in this chair it is necessary to use the on stage fs7850b guitar foot rest. i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck. i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions.as for the four out of five star review, the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for $85. but it's a nice design and thank you to the designer. i would recommend it to those who can afford it.as for durability..... we shall see. i have had it for three months now and it is still fine.  i use it daily. 4
this is an essential accessory for the excellent line 6 spider iv combo amps,  for more details, see my review of the line 6 spider iv 75 watt combo.  the fbv express mk ii is the least expensive pedal to give one full control over all basic and essential amp features. this pedal should have been ( or be) included with the amp but it wasn't.  anyway, if you are considering buying the amp (which is great), you really will want to have this pedal, even though it costs 33% of the price of the amp itself.with the fbv express mk ii you can store the 4 amp channels, each of which has its own settings for model and all effects, as well as control the 14 second looping ability of the spider iv.  the pedal also adds a volume/way pedal (the wah pedal is ok but not as full-throated as a cry baby or other stand-alone wah wahs).  without the pedal, you will not be able to access looping and channel switching in real time while playing (which is the whole point of this thing) unless you have more than the standard compliment of 2 arms, equipped with one  hand each.the pedal also interfaces with a computer to allow deep editing and storing of all of the effects of the line 6 spider iv combos through a usb port.  this feature alone makes it a must-have for taking full advantage of the amp.j.m. tepper 5
when i first learned guitar, my buddies kept telling me i'd want a capo but i held out until just recently. the dunlop is secure, doesn't scratch the guitar at all, and holds the strings down as it should. instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning, i can use this to achieve the tone i want. good item for the price. 5
i don't put these on every guitar but on the right guitar they are perfect.  what's the right guitar?  longer scales- like a strat.  i would not put these on a shorter scale (22") because it would get too flubby.  if you hit the power chords hard you may also want to stear clear-  these require a bit more subtlety in your attack or you will vibrate in and out of tune on the low e when you are pulling off windmills like townshend.  they do allow super  easy string bends for when i feel lazy or for when my fingers are torn up from playing.  ymmv. 5
great recorder on so many levels.i use it for external audio recording for dslr video.i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics.dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible.not intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functions.something i will have to get used to. 4
it is very well made, is easy to use, and holds down the strings just fine.  it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar. 5
this is a wonderful item that really works! arrived fast! having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards! this makes a great gift item! 5
this tunners turned my normal cheap squier, into a perfect squier. my guitar now stays in tune better than my prs and epiphone. 5
no way this thing cost lest than $40.  i needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so i gave the joyo pedals a try and i am pleasently surprised.  this compares to my other compression pedals i own...in a metal case???? bonus.  i'm super happy with my joyo pedals. 5
i've had this for several years. it has worked flawlessly. it has done a pretty good job with many recordings, especially in the field. zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior.  at the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class. 4
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric (7.23 lbs.). noproblem. just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. it's a nice convenience. if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. you've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.what i don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. that is why i chose black for mysecond set. helps keep the product's profile down a bit. other than that, the product works asadvertised....note: as of june 2014 i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture. 4
unquestionably a top-of-the-line manual string winder, but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar's headstock.  on some tuners this might work great, but on various of mine, still sloppy.  for now i'll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb. 3
it's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. tried everything i could, but it's gone. i would not recommend this pedal. 1
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone.  more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs.  but i know several people who have had problems with the switch, and i have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah.  but i am not sure that i am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  i kinda think i am.  the vox and bbe seem to have a brighter sound which is less "wah-ed" if you will.  it could be accentuated by me playing a strat instead of the les paul custom/boogie combination i used with the crybaby. 4
i realized i didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so i set out to find a distortion pedal.  after scouring the forums i find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey.  since i don't want to spend a bunch of money i get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright.  the only thing i don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent. transparent in that it doesn't add a lot of color to your amp just distortion.  i use this pedal with vintage fender silverface amps, which are already bright, so i turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the spark booster that i have in front of the us dream. i have to use the spark booster to hit the us dream hard because most of the guitars i use don't have hot enough pickups.the price was right, i'm happy with it. 4
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it. . . once.normally, after tuning new strings for the first time, i break them in by rigorously bending them, using the whammy bar and tugging on them then i re-tune them. i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays. not with these strings. tuned them once, no breaking in.it sounds amazing on clean; on its own without any effects, and the natural sustain is great. they also sound good with any settings i use.i bought two sets. 5
30 bucks is better than 179 for the tube screamer from ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube.  i use this on the clean channel of my bugera v22 tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should.  awesome with my ltd vc-401 with 59 and jb pickups. 5
im a man on the move and am constantly away from home. i take this bad boy with me everywhere to satify my need to pick 6 strings.  great for takin to the beach or on the boat or to entertain yourself on long car rides. 4
these knobs arrived in perfect condition, the correct color and fit my stratocaster remake well. you can't necessarily go wrong with knobs. i like the black look to my guitar now. 5
i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here.  the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m1 mic or similar.i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but i opened one, tried to use it and can't. it was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it.  i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose.  again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands. 2
for $99 you get the best good sized, heavy duty, high quality amp with tons of sound!-construction: solid, good material and parts, fender used the good stuff.-sound: nice clear & loud sound especially for an 8" speaker and 20w amp. you can definitely jam with a drummer no problem, or just shred it wearing headphones.-effects: there are 9 "amp models" (i.e. "57 deluxe", "metal 2000", etc...) and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from, you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp models.the effects include chorus, deep chorus, flange, tremelo, vibration, phaser, step filter, delay (150ms, 300ms, 700ms), reverb, large hall, small room, echo filter, octaver, etc...)so what are the presets? each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds).when you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the "gain" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set. same with treble, bass, volume, and all other effects. the moment you touch any dials or effects knobs, you have custom control to tweak each preset, just temporarily, or save it if you wish.it's so great, because often i feel i would have made a present slightly more this or that, simply grab the gain or change the treble, or move from delay to reverb and make it your own! very easy.-ease of use: plug in your guitar, spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects. plug in ipod or computer with 3.5mm male cable. it's that easy!-pc software: i've heard their is trouble installing, mine said "error" and did not install on windows 7. i know there are ways to fix this, and i will do so when i have some time. comes with a usb cable (mini for the amp, regular plug for the computer). works for mac or pc, get more presets, use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer. play on guitar rig and amplitude. awesome.-size: perfect. big enough to give it a serious look, and a quality feel. small enough to fit easily under a table, next to your desk, etc. looks like 18"x18" to me. the front metal-looking grill is mesh, but quality and looks great.-tuner: super simple. doesn't tell you which note is in tune, just tells you left, right, or green in center for "in tune".all in all when compared to the line 6 spider, and many other fender amps, this one has the quality sound, the dozens of different effect combinations, input for a footswitch, aux for ipod, and usb for computer. it has it all. i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it. the reverb and gain distortion are so clean, and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone. my guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp.don't sleep on this, it's $99 for a loud quality amp with $1,000s worth of effects peddles built in.and did i mention, easily customizable so easy i could teach a 5 year old. select a preset, change the dials you want to change, make changes permanent only by hitting "save" otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them.love this amp, and i've shopped every comparable model. this is the one, hands down worth a minimum of $150.louder than my friends 60w!:d one love fender mustang you rock! 5
absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock--1970's influences.  i would probably buy the phase 100 today though, as it has 4 different positions to choose from, i assume including the original set-up as one of them.well, i need to correct this.  this review was for the old models.  the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified.  i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one, but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!i will probably get an eh small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too.  sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough, if at all about the sound/quality of their products.  the capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live.  god help us! 3
i agree with the others - i've been using fast fret for over 20 years (and finger ease spray for over 40), but i believe slick is a better product.  i give it just 4 stars, though, due to its design. the wiping cloth that comes with slick is meant to fit in a small plastic ziplock bag inside the cap, but it's difficult to get the cloth back inside the small bag, and it's bulky inside the cap, making it a little difficult to close with the cloth inside the cap. it would be easier to close if the cap side was deeper; the way it's designed now, the cap and the applicator are equally sized, when they needn't be. that's a small gripe, though - if i could give it 4-1/2 stars (with half a star off for the design), i would - it's great stuff. 4
these are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine i've always been a huge fan of jim dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come 5
love these picks. have used them for years. feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. highly recommend. 5
i have several of these straps in different colors and i've never been disappointed.  it holds my 11 pound les paul with no problems and the first one i bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong.  if you like the design, go for it! 5
these are a direct drop in replacement on fender standard (mim) stratocasters, fender american standard, fender american deluxe.i have replaced my tuners of this style with fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back.unfortunately, the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish. (but you can get them, ultimately.)i ordered a set of these non-locking ones - the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender's /schaller's gold hardware. (not all gold hardware is the same color gold). the quality is good and they look and function well. however, i returned them because they are not locking...i ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar i was building.if you just want gold tuners, don't care about the string locking feature, and are playing a fender strat or tele - you can't beat these. by comparison to a lot of the gold tuners, the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too. 4
this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable i don't have problems with it tangling like i saw on one review 5
love the security of having my picks within grasp!  great product and great value! i would highly recommend this to others. 5
i have been disappointed with the last eq pedal i owned witch was a boss ge7, it was very honkey and colored my tone to much, this pedal is much more musical the layout of the essential frequency's is great, plus they are lighted and very ez to see. and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank and will last for ever 5
well made, proven over decades. switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck. not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement. requires less adjustment. square pad allows placement right next to the fret. easy to adjust with a bit of practice.i enjoy using quality machined parts, so this is a pleasure, plus it is built to last. 5
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recording/producing. i absolutely love these picks and swear by them. i've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that i landed on years ago and stuck to. i've had years of lessons, licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me! perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms. i'd order again if i had to. 5
this tuner tunes my guitars very well, it tunes them perfectly, and works well tuning bass guitar, very easy to use, very visible screen when tuning, clamps on nicely, and the red color is very beautiful you could say, all in all very good tuner. 5
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved. gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison. both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does. i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product. 2
this snark thing is the cats meow, its absolutely charlie. it hears things i don't and tells me whether they are what i want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together.if you like being in tune, this is probably for you. it is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything. you can clamp it on a cat's tail, but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don't even think about doing that you sicko.great design, easy to read, works better than 2 other brand tuners i own. only bummer is you can't carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one. if it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars, oh well.i suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool, hip, out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity.  oh the peer pressure........ 5
what can you say about something that you need but is really insignificant in the scheme of things.  i needed it and it works simple as that 5
i use clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. my picks don't fit!!! if i shove them in, i can't get them out. also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck. 1
this was something i had to pick up, simply due to the price.  i own a shure sm57 and compared to this, the sound is very close, not dead on, but i'd consider this over other mics for someone on a budget.the  top does not spin like the shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost i'm sure, but none the less, it makes no difference sound wise.overall, a great buy! 4
this has the largest top of any of my stands, and it is the one i use when traveling / gigs. the top doesn't fold like some of the more expensive stagg  hercules stands, so if you're using it for gigging, that may be something to consider. i have to lug an 88key weighted piano around, so don't mind lugging this. 4
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock.  i am pleased that they match my telecaster.  straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need. 5
i bought this guitar about 2 years ago and i have played tons of different acoustic guitars from taylor to fender and more. this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played. the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well. i love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars. additionally, this is my favorite guitar and i would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic. this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars. the guitar has no finish which i prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands. i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value. this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice. recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature i promise you won't be disappointed and i have been playing for 6 years so i know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar. thanks takamine!!!!! 5
this tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tune.it is good deal for the money 3
this is just what i needed to get rid of three or four large ac adapters. great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board. 4
this is a very stable, comfortable seat.  the legs are easily removable for storage. love that it is rated for higher weights so i don't have to worry about it collapsing. 5
i quite like the sound of this thing, running through a crate acoustic guitar amplifier. it sounds really natural, and it's easy to dial in a nice sound. it's hard to hear it while you're playing; you're better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you, or trusting someone else to set the amp. like most of these kinds of pickups, it's quite susceptible to feedback, so you can't get out in front of the amplifier and listen. not a slam on the product-that's just the nature of the beast. i'm an honest to goodness terrible violinist, but i got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children. it's a beginner class, and hearing the right sound is really helpful. it works great. i don't turn it up very loud-just a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room. i hate the &#34;short&#34; cord, and i wish i could use a regular instrument cable, but i can understand that they don't want a lot of weight pulling on your violin. but the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifier-unless you use some kind of little pre amp. in fairness, the cord is a reasonable length, but i'm quite tall, so it's 5' of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder. 4
let's get a few things straight from the start - i love effects pedals.  i love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal (and have owned a few), and i'll also play the mass-produced boss and ibanez stuff.  and if you put foreign/no-name brand in front of me, but the pedal is made well and sounds good, i'll play that too.  all you need to know is that this pedal is well-constructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollars.joyo is a chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor (a heavy-duty metal box with an mxr-like button switcher), and then clones/mimics/copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from $100 to $250.  and they've figured out how to ship them to the u.s. and sell them for $40 to $60 each.  i've recently discovered these pedals, and if money/pedalboard space were no issue, there's probably 8 to 12 of them i'd like to own.the "star" of the joyo lineup, however, is arguably the jf-02 ultimate drive.  this pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an american company bought them in bulk, repainted them, and tried to sell them for almost $200.  the fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the quality.the pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the fulltone ocd overdrive, a boutique pedal that came out several years ago, and usually sells from around $150.  i own that pedal, and i've done a side by side comparison on my pedal board.  and while tone is extremely subjective, i'm not sure that i wouldn't go with the joyo ultimate drive in a blind test.  while the 3-knob, lo/hi switch are clearly inspired by the fulltone ocd, the pedals actually sound quite different.  with the exact same settings, the fulltone will actually sound much brighter.  that's really saying something because the fulltone is known as having a very well-rounded tone with a defined base.  well, the ultimate drive offers even more bass and mids, yet the tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom end.it's actually extremely versatile.  i'm not sure that it would do low-gain "crunch" sounds very well, but if that's what you want, consider the joyo vintage overdrive, the joyo crunch distortion, or a tubescreamer.  right now, i have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great "overdriven marshall" tone: the fulltone, the ultimate drive, and the marshall gv-2 guv'nor.  while they are all great pedals, the joyo really hits the sweet spot on my vox combo amp (using a gibson les paul).as for soloing/lead play, i'm noticing all types of pick attack/harmonic response with the joyo that i don't get with other stompboxes.  it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel.  if you point all the knobs at 12 o' clock, some people may think it is muddy, but that tone knob really does change the character quite a bit.  sorry for the long rant, but i want people to know that just because you can't afford $150+ on a single pedal doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great overdrive stomp box.  check the jf-02 out - it just might be your "gateway drug" to other joyo pedals! 5
i picked up an old boss me-6b that required the boss bra-120 power supply. that thing outputs 12vac. it also has a different size connector. being that those wallwart power supplies go for around  thirty dollars, i wasn't interested. so instead i spent ninety more dollars on this fuel tank and got a dc power plug 5.5x2.1mm to 6.3x3.0mm female adapter. using  the 12vac output on my fuel tank chameleon works great. awesome overkill solution. it also powers everything else and looks fine doing it. 5
great price. i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board. very flexable and pretty good quality 4
5 stars because it works as its described, and has a nice display. i like this better than my old snark. it's got a better build quality than the snark for sure. 5
not quite as good as the red all instrument snark, but it gets the job done and the price is right. 4
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. however, the bag was ripped in 3 places. the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. the holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway...bit disappointing. 2
its a pop filter, it works well and does the job.  however the neck on this thing is a bit long, so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way.  otherwise its a good option at a good price. 4
these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive. the tone is clear and bright. i have used d'addario for years 4
this is a great tremolo pedal.it is very quiet and when used correctly, there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever.you can blend the tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged "on/off" type tremolo.tremolo varies the volume of the sound. it does not vary the pitch.you have control over the "depth" or "amount" of effect, and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.a very simple, popular effect that i wouldn't want to live without in some form or another.pretty teal green color.as with all boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.i have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because i use a power supply.there is no on/off clicking when depressed.there is no added hiss, hum or distortion.the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything.simply a great effect and quality product from boss and tends to hold its resale value well. 5
this thing works great and it looks very stylish with the guitar hanging on the wall.  this also keeps it away from the kids who always seem to want to play it.  very good idea and holds it perfectly. 5
i really dig these.  i have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks, and the worst thing is that when i drop them, they are impossible to find on my beige carpet.  the one i'm using has barely worn with at least 10 hours of playing on it.the size of the pick is the same as normal, it is just more tapered.  i tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it, but it was a little to much work as i dipped it too far into the strings, so i reverted back to a wider gator grip 1.14, which works better with the bigger strings. i am still searching for the world's perfect all-purpose pick. this works until then 5
i've been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while, but i was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. i was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; i have a taylor big baby that i bought used, and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.i'd just changed the strings on my 1970s gibson gospel a week ago, so i decided that would be my reference. the nanowebs went on my 1970s guild d-35. both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. the gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but i'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. if they d-35 sounded dull, i'd notice.as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled "light" gauge, they had a 0.013" e string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. the b was a .017, compared to the .016 of the d'addarios i usually play. the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. turns out that these are "hd light" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. the difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d-35.so how do they sound? the unwound e and b don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when i switch between the d-35 and the gospel. sound-wise, i'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. i wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. if i didn't know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. so they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. that leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?here's the way i see it: if you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. you're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. but if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. and if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. for myself, i'm going to leave these on the d-35 for as long as they still sound good. i'll update this review when i find out just how long they do last.follow up: after playing these for a few days, i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. they sound great on the loar, and now i have two guitars to do a long term test on. 5
these  picks  r awsome!  i have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....they have a gell  center,  whitch  tingles,  it feels like muscles are activating in your hand  great theraputic picki seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.these  picks have a indentation so u know where put ur thumb and index fingerthey really do what they say....if u have hand problems,  try these.....they really work. 5
i had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed!  this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack.  it never sounds &#34;thumpy&#34; or unnatural - but always musical.  i really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like. 5
for the price this is a wonderful strap. it can get twisted and wear out, but keep it straight and it will last you a long time. it has a vintage look, very soft and comfortable. it also has that vintage fender coolness factor. i have 30+ year old leather straps that will be around years after i'm gone but i paid a lot for them and they're not as comfortable as this. i've even used these on gibson's (oh, the shame) but of course they look best on fender's, i guess. the truth is they will work on anything. the strap ends are great, but they're not really secure. gaskets can take care of that. i own quite a few of these are they're great quality, look cool (in a vintage kinda way) and feel soft on my shoulder. 5
i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar, and what a difference!!!  the original equipment spring  tension was so stiff that the tremolo didn't even work.  now it sounds great! 5
for what it's supposed to do, it works very well. i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think. this is still usable, but it is for very big fingers. i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there, but this still leaves some extra room. either way, it works well. it feels very sturdy and i'm not worried about it cracking anytime soon. for the price, it's a must have. 4
if you're into playing blues, these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage, they allow you to bend the strigs easier.  i'm not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment, but i'd use these anywhere. 5
the best eb slinky's i've ever used. on these i use the light's--9's. even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well. i use them on all 4 of my guitar's. two fender american standard's, gibson es-335. gibson les paul/ with bigsby. i always have a set in each case..... try'um... ya won't regret it !!!!! 5
this capo is expensive, but i have never found one that works so well. it is worth the money in my opinion. 5
it's a capo... nice fit... yet, sometimes i wonder if it fits too tightly, as when i use it, and of course the strings are tighter, sometimes i feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight...yet, it is a capo, structured very well. 4
when you are upgrading your fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold fender jack plate. 5
this product is great. you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals. read the description so you can have a sense of size. tue quality is very nice, solid and resistible. the soft case is very nice also. 5
i've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down.  i play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc., during a show. a couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish. i've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results.tip: a little goes a long way. i play every week, i use this stuff every time i put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle.  i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month.  :) 5
i use this for my ipad.  i drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit. it's solid and works great, very adjustable... good seller to... 5
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away. excellent fer recording acoustic's 5
i love adding channels to amps, and that is exactly what this pedal does. it helped me create a separate fuzz/distortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile. it's built to last and solid as a rock. i love the different dirt it gets combined with my mxr carbon copy nooned across the board. insanity! i love my main rig distortion, but this definitely helps add depth, and doesn't tank my tone. last distortion pedal you'll ever need. 5
i got what i ordered.  however, if i had paid more attention, this is nothing but a standard power supply which i could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the tascam name on it.update 5-03-2012 after receiving comments and reading other reviews:i've gotten a comment and have read many comments and i don't know where the fault lies, but this power supply is not the power supply for the new replacement tascam dr-07mkii.  the power supply for that unit is the ps-p515uif you are unsure what power supply for which model tascam recorder you have, go to tascam's website and research it before buying it.the tascam psp520 ac adapter/power supply for mpgt1 is for and does work with the older tascam dr-07 recorder.  i have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered pa head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent. 5
i recently changed them out for a different type of eb's while they were good the were not exactly what i was looking for. not sure the new set is either but time will tell. 4
i purchased this key on a whim.  when it arrived the instructions were not clear, but i sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning. too loose and deep, so i increased the setting to #3 and repeated.  almost the sound i wanted, so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern.  perfect.  i then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest.  using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms 1/2 octave apart.next i worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side. i used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound i wanted. the bass drum came next - i set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning. from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained.this is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two. when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting.  test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want. set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set.i'll never go back to tuning by ear!  you'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key, and don't forget to write down your optimum settings. 5
i just got this yesterday so i don't know how long it will prolong the string's life but i have noticed a difference already. it's a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone. also, it's cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you. i'm really happy that i "discovered" this product, in fact, i'm already ordering 2 more. 5
i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two. sounded lovely for the first hour, that's why two stars. granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais, if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can't recommend personally. 2
i have the snark 2 but read that this was the best so far.  i got and agreethis works better.  i would recommend it to anyone. 5
i don't travel often with my guitars, but needed good protection for those times when i do. this product meets all my expectations. my les paul and fat strat, both fit well in the case. it provides good support and cushioning, with a roomy accessories compartment. the corners of the case are well reinforced. the hardware is mid-grade. i believe it will hold up well for my use, and for someone playing weekend gigs. overall it is a bargain for the price. 5
this capo does what it needs to do, makes it sound great, and is a great price. there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general, it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar. it does not break, and is very sturdy. highly recommended. 5
holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness. i stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by. 4
i like replacing the pickguard and other plastic parts to give my guitars a different look.  it takes under $40 (accessory kit + pickguard) to give your guitar a make over.money well spent. 5
just received the cable, it sounds clear, doesn't feel like it is made of the best materials, i just got this cable today so i can't really comment on how durable it is and how long it will last, so far i tend to believe it is a decent cable for the price, i don't use a microphone very often so this cable should last a while. so far it is working well, i would buy another one if i needed it, the price is right, 3
nice design... small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. i am thinking about getting a 2nd one. 5
i can't speak on the claim for a longer string life.  the strings are true to elixir's quality and tone.  these strings sound great plug and unplugged.  i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too.  there are tonal differences as expected.  the 80/20 are brighter, but the tones are clear and crisp.  when amplified, i did note less finger noise as i re-positioned or slid my fingers along the strings.  i didn't notice any difference to the feel of the string...as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years.  time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions.  for now, even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb ... you're still getting a good deal. 5
these are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks.  thus, just a heads-up.  having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks.  i use all types and all brands and fender's are always predictably great quality. 5
this passive di-box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input.  some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation.  the -20db attenuation sounded funny, but that is probably because i used the same equipment for all attenuation settings.  with each attenuation setting, i had to adjust the input volume accordingly.  this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops.  all the devices that i tried this with did not have their own internal grounding, so i needed to have the ground come from the mixer.  i did get some hum when i would touch the case, just like i did with other di-boxes.  this product worked very well for my needs. 5
if you're a metalhead, stay away!! i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g10 blows it out of the water. this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion. it's great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch. but if you demand metal, get far away! 1
i was using a nylon strap before i got this one. i love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap. the leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and i don't have that worry of it coming loose. 5
pros:* small. easy to take with you or set on a small shelf.* if using usb, does not need external power supply.  very convenient.* easy-to-use, accessible controls.* pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes.* plug & play with windows 8.  didn't have to install any kind of driver.* variety of input options.  dual track with low/high volume sliders.* leds make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range.  easy to adjust.* awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a usb-based preamp-only device.* free shipping-- gotta like thatcons:* only one power setting, 15v. that may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike.* line in / usb buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive.  however the manual shows exact settings for computer use.* as with other low-end behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out.  can take some fiddling to overcome it.* it's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion.  start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good.notes:i purchased this for use with my studio mike, which i hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs.  plugged it in, worked first time, no problems.this unit is very sensitive.  if used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room.  with a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work.  i use it for guitar/voice solo live internet music shows.overall, i'm quite pleased with the unit.  the only reason i give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect... but then it's only fifty bucks.  for the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, i don't think one could find a better unit.  two thumbs up.  i don't know how a pro would rate this... but i definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average "usb microphones" available on the market.  you not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal.  hard to beat at that price.addendum:  a few days after the initial review-- i just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast.  no background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission.  friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance.  quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp.hints and tips:two good hints on this one:* another user and i put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 aa cells), hook them into a usb printer cable and power this via battery.  it works great and makes this unit portable.* there are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the windows handles sound. i have found this to be true. it pretty much takes over your entire sound system. for some folks this will be fine. for others, they may not appreciate this. so what i did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer usb (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait...)... and plugged it into one of those new portable-usb power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10). this powers the system without hooking it into the usb system of your computer. what this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like audacity.you then run a line in from your computer speaker output, a line out to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want. this is an excellent alternative to using it as a usb device. you are instead powering it from a usb wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well). that's what i finally did and am still most happy with this device.in addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what os you use. you could use this with windows, mac, linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables. works very well in this capacity. gotta love those new external usb power nodes. : ) 4
i usually don't buy many guitar straps, and when i do, i like to get a thick, leather-type one, because i've found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while, and i don't like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments.  i bought the black version; i think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over, so i probably won't worry about running colors (but i will keep an eye out for such a thing).  it's very adjustable (just not quickly adjustable), worked perfectly with my straplocks, and keeps my 45 pound (it seems like it, anyway) les paul from digging into my shoulder.  the 2.5 inch width is fine for me, but if you're spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster, i'd go up to the 3 inch model, especially if you're going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours. 5
trustable, quiet, good materials, durable, etc... maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalb bcuz of their large plug'heads', but they do a perfect job with my guitar signal...and honestly, for me, that's what i need... good stuff to have! 5
i am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings. this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard .... and even my bass. the cd input has no controls but is a very useful feature just the same. having behringer mics and a ub802 mixer, i banked on this being a good amp and was not disappointed. the 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument. no 15-watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings.... and do not expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you. every musician should have one of these around. money well spent! 5
it's yellow, its metal, its boss.  if you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get.  the best od i have ever owned.  makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half. 4
this is a very good pickholder by dunlop and looks much nicer than the regular dunlop 5000 or 5005 - it does what it should and looks more esthetical than the dunlop 5000 or 5005 versions. it does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005. it actually holds a couple of picks less. it holds some 4 or maybe 5 picks while the 5005 holds around 7 (if you use 0.60. gauge picks or lower). i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks. since i use the planet waves chrome dome stainless steel picks (joe satriani), i only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one i am playing with, so for me it does the job perfectly. i have a nice 2013 paul reed smith custom 24 with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top, so i needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it. the adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitar's top if placed as instructed. place it gently, no need to press it too hard. alean the surface very well before placing but do not use carnauba or any polishing material or gel before installing - just regular guitar top cleaner (i use the prs cleaner for example). cheers! 5
its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back 3
pack of 10 guitar picks - check"meet the beatles" theme - checkretail packaging - checktwo-day delivery (got it the next day... thanks to prime) - checkhappy guitarist - checki can't really complain about anything, except maybe for the price.  but then again, i didn't have to buy these.  they are fun and kitschy.  5-stars. 5
definitely holds the guitar well . a little pricey but probably worth it. i'm a fan of dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one. 4
these cables work well for my guitar, keyboard and drums.  they appear to hold up well under constant moving.  i will be getting more. 4
not much to say about a guitar strap... except i had planned to use it on a simga acoustic without a pin at the neck. i ended up using the strap on my strat for the acoustic and this one is on the strat. this one doesn't come with a wrap or tie for the nut so, it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body. if you need to secure one end at the headstock, this is not an option. it is comfortable though. 3
the power supply which is not included is a funky size, it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but i wouldn't recommend it only because it is not the proper size.  the guy that was using this was using it with a fender telecaster, and a single 12&#34; tube amp.  he found that the volume was cut by ~ 15-20% even with the pedal turned all the way up.  any time a pedal allows for volume loss , it tends to effect tone & yes, mr. sound engineer, &#34;tone&#34; is a real thing!the pedal is pretty bulky and won't fit well in most pedal boards, but it's not any more wide than the morley, but it seems to be taller, longer, and heavier.i gave it 3 stars because, &#34;it's okay&#34;, but it is far from great, and i would not buy this product again.  i understand the price is cheap, and if this is all you can afford, then go for it, but if you have the extra cheese, spread it. 3
i have tried many picks in my 25+ years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best. i have been using dunlop for the most recent years, but these are the best. the carbon fiber of these dunlop jazz iii make them as long lasting as you want - when playing rock (slides and picking) they are better than any other material, and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz. their grip is excellent and they feel awesome. gotta try them! highly recommended. cheers! 5
i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily. makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly. i buy one of these for each guitar. but i only use my favorite strap. 5
this is a nice strap. it's kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because it's stiff. that turned out to be good  good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat, it would  be sad if your axe fell in your soup! 5
i wanted the version of this device with the built-in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar. maybe i should just change the guitar pitch to my off-pitch singing and i could finally achieve perfect harmony! i like everything about it especially (i think) it's ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life. a well designed device. 5
i love these tuners.  i have tried the intel, krog, boss, etc... and out of all of them, i like the snark the best.  response and visual display are awesome.  unlike a couple of the others i've used, the snark works well on any place on the headstock.  a couple of the other brands i had to be careful where i positioned them because they didn't respond well.  you can't go wrong with any snark. 5
what can i say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal?.... great choice to add some trashy color to my cymbal set up (all wuhans because they are cheap and blow away most of the big boy companies). one thing that surprised me was how big the sound was and how nice it cut right thru my other cymbals. you cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal. placed it on top of my 18' crash and it looks great!!! 5
i have these on my jazz bass, my guitar player has another brand. we were playing a huge downtown street gig in altanta and were throwing t shirts to the crowd. bending down, picking them up, then throwing. my guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 les paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. mine stayed locked perfectly... 5
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  some say that the grip is good.  here's my take -- for what it's worth.  i've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  round and flat wound strings.  my general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  it's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  also note, i play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  so the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  i do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  i've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what i've found so far.  i find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars i'm currently playing.  the process of finding the "right" pick is never ending and changes over time.  give these a try and let me know what you think. 4
sounds ok on its own, not very loud or good quality at any high volume, but then when you plug in some good headphones, awesome! great gain, tone, high volume, sounds awesome, perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect. great sound, awesome deal. score! :d 5
i love a lot of danelectro products, but not really this one, i give it 3/5 because it works as advertised.the features are good. true bypass requires a 9v wall plug, and adjustments are good.but here's my issue- the distortion is not 'crunchy.' it distorts, sure, but the sound is not dimensional... it has no depth to it.thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres, but i play a lot of blues-rock... i ended up switching to a vintage-tube overdrive by behringer.not for me, maybe for you. 3
the action was a little high for my taste.  the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible. why do they sell an instrument with crap strings? that is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument.  otherwise it's well built and works.  really it's a three and a half star imo, it's not as nice sounding or as playable as my mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings. 3
serves its purpose; worked better when i added a quick-disconnect attachment; quality finish, comfortable, and enough range to adjust as needed; 5
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode. the screen could be a little brighter. otherwise, no complaints. 4
i put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time. great strings and great value 5
they said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you're playing up to three octaves, but i could never get that feature to work properly.from video reviews i've heard on youtube, this harmonizer does not even come close to the boss version, but it costs about $100 less.  since i am not a professional musician and i am just playing around with it, it works just fine.  and ... you get what you pay for.addendum:  i've now owned this for a while, and discovered that it can turn my six-string strat into a bass, by turning the balance knob all the way to the right, and my pitch on the second from bottom position.  in fact, when i record my dean edge bass onto the boss loop station and then record my strat on top of it using the behringer  ultra shifter/harmonist, i cannot tell any difference in tonality.i am thinking of selling my bass.  it has just become a needless expense.  needs the neck adjusted twice a year, the strings are expensive, and it is harder to play then my strat. 4
for any sound techs that like to make things simple and easy to work,these xlr jumper cables are the way to go, and the quality is impressive . i used them for a new set of wireless mike to jump into my 16 channel board and was it so easy, my mikes are color coded and my cable fitted right in with the same color code thus making it easy to identify from afar and easy to control on the mixing board. 5
this stuff works amazingly. if your interested in buying the product, don't listen to the people who say it is too dry. i thought it worked good, and mine was a bit dry. this stuff isn't supposed to be really waxy, its a hard wax so i would think it was supposed to be cracked. mine wasn't that cracked, and it worked great! i love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a must-have. 5
i bought these because i wanted durable, flexible picks for easy strumming. i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming. 5
this is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget.  it works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected. 5
i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price. i previously had thelucero lc100 classical guitar black (black)which i was completely happy with as a beginner. when it got damaged beyond repair, i looked into thecordoba dolce 7/8 size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i didn't really like the size, so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c5.it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range. the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c5 has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar. while it isn't it the prettiest guitar out there, it's by no means ugly. even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar.the smell of this guitar is also amazing. it doesn't have the cheap wood glue smell of other low-end guitars, but a nice rich smell of wood. even after a few months, kept in a humicase, the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present.all praise aside, it is not a flawless guitar. my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars, especially those at a lower price range. not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of: being a cedar guitar, the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar.i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package. it is a high-quality gig bag with lots of padding. inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place. it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books. when i ordered this guitar from amazon, the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box. i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely.overall, i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered, it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years. highly recommended! 5
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion.  overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  i run a randall g3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state i've used or heard.  for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.recently i started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that i felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, i used the dod death metal for years when i first started playing.  however, there is a downside.  go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old am radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.i chose the mt-2 because i know boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  it gives a variety of sounds.  it can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  the controls make it very tweakable and i have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  read the included book, look up some mp3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  it will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  there are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.i've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  i must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt-2.  i used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.i say the mt-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board. 4
this is what all distortion pedals are judged by.  adds thick creamy distortion, enhances harmonics, and maintains great attack and definition.  sounds awesome.  true bypass. 5
the honeytone is aptly named.  it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size. that reputation is earned.  it has double the volume of a portable amp i own that's twice its size.  the tone range is generous (from mellow to high treble).  from what i've seen and heard, the &#34;overdrive&#34; function is fairly useless in an amp this size.  it tends to go distortion to the point of garble.  my guess is specific guitars may work well with the overdrive, but i have no use for it as i prefer clear tones.  it is possible to over-volume the amp (as with any amp) so i don't max it out, but for a portable or practice amp, it works very well.  i've bought three of these now and plan to buy more.  i don't know as i'd pay $40 to $60 for it, but the amazon price (currently around $20) makes it a great value.  i hope it's around at this price level for a long time as it's great for hobbyist projects or for box guitar amping. 5
finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because i don't like them too thin or too thick, this was the perfect gauge i was looking and hoping for. the logo will wear out in a few uses but i don't much about that. been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it's not wearing out too fast. recommended! 5
just use a smartphone to record stuff. this is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones. not really worth the $75 - i returned mine. 1
in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist. the crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as i can foresee. 5
is a nice cable,,god quality  as always with the fender brand... guys if you need a cable that are not high budget,, and a god quality this is the cable.... 5
that cloth... they should have included something that doesn't fall apart.otherwise it's great. i use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned, but i'm with other people here who commented that you can't really tell how much of the stuff is left inside. good idea to keep more than one of these around. 4
i replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these, as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates. the plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment i mounted. inexpensive, and worth it. 5
volume control is nice. two clicks to choose from- the low click is better than the high one to my ear. i would recommend this product. 4
i could not expect a better violin stand. it is very robust, versatile, good looking and not very expensive. highly recommended. 5
this is one beefy string winder.  there is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy $2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstore.pros:- very sturdy- rotates extremely smoothly- well balanced- fits every guitar tuning key i've tried- high-impact plastic body should withstand years (decades?) of abuse- clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus -- for earplugs, extra end pins, whatevercons:- none whatsoever.buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits. 5
2 15&#34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet. these hold up great year round. i will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand... 5
i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano (i have a pro model with xlr outs) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces.  works every time.  balanced signal is so much better...no more issues with ground loops or other problems.  just clear as a bell.they were cheap and the build quality is fine. 5
great gig bag for acoustic guitar. very well made with good padding. it has six nice pockets, a rubber bumper, and two straps. it fits the guitar nicely. i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag. the strap and picks were an added bonus. a great value. 5
for the money they are great ,look nice are very easy to install .you will like them on the guitar. 5
got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me, my guitar, and my sound.i'm a 62 yo newby to guitar!! this proves that easy helps. i have a big baby taylor and when i needed new strings i went to the wrong place, got martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. my friend said that he uses d'addario and that they make all the difference in the world!! tried them and he was right.  i changed my own (on the big baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the e and b string like the dealer did!) my taylor recommends elixr, but the d'addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!! 5
it doesnt completely mute my violin but i suppose nothing really can, it does take the loud peircing noise out though 5
these are solid stands for holding your guitars. i use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great. they are an excellent value.the reason they are so important to have is that, by having your guitars out and available to play, you will get more practice. they help me pick up my guitars much more often. instead of dragging out the case and getting a single 20 minute session, i might get 4 or 5 10 minute sessions a night -- more on the weekends.stands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store. i highly recommend these for around the house use. 5
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive.  come on, capos don't have &#34;tone.&#34;  just get one that doesn't get in your way.  also, the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys.  thank you, dunlop, for keeping it real up in benicia. 5
i bought this to replace a behringer uca202. the behringer performs very well for my use (guitar in a home studio), but recently it's become way too sensitive to interference; i was getting noise from the nearby cable modem / router / network drives. this noise was making its way to my recordings too :-(for what ended up being less than twice the price of the behringer i decided to try this unit. not only is it interference-free, it has a much warmer, intimate sound.it's usb powered, installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues. i did go to the lexicon website and get their driver, though, just to be on the safe side.reaper had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel (asio! :-) ). everything just works great, first time. i was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero-latency monitoring on the device :-)great unit. i love the behringer, but this thing kicks it in the tail. 5
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic. the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone. i might try a lighter set next time, but these have a good clear tone from low to high, and are fairly comfortable. 4
i bought this just to see if i might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (i'm gettin' old...lol)would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice.  i wouldn't say it's agreat instrument but way more than i expected for $60.  after i changed the strings,(i used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound.  i bought anew bow (for &#62;$100, so...) and found i like the one that came with it at least as much.the case is excellent...i'll prob use it with my upgrade.so for the price, you really get far more than you pay for.p.s.- the shoulder rest is kinda useless though. 4
it's working ok, not for hard usei just use it on my pc table for karaoke online.with phantom mic it's well done. 4
i use it to wind my strings! i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast. very easy to use! 5
i ordered this product on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday. came very well packaged and with all the pieces. i was very easy to assembly and looks great! for the price, you really can't go wrong with this guitar stand. works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won't fall off. padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. great stand for the price!!! 5
if your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped x bracing, you should really get these strings. they bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the d'daddarios and they are about the same price. best of all they last extremely long, but i've broken a few strings over the past months. overall great strings and pretty consistent. 5
the snark sn-8(b)super tight all instrument tuner is the best snark tuner i've purchased, of 4 models. this sn-8, has a matte type finish, not glossy, it has a gun metal black look to me which i prefer to the glossy finished models. the dial, is easy to read, the bars on the dial are bold. all snark tuners are a great value, they function as well as any brand. 5
works great - very good feel - we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetmy wife loves it - if i needed two i would buy another 5
the one i got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw. i feel like if i tighten it too much, i could dent my mic stand tube. but i haven't dented anything yet, so perhaps i'm just too skeptical. in any event, it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction. but everything works. it's getting the job done and i haven't seen a better option. all in all, a pretty good device. 4
i like the way the snark attaches to all of my guitars and a mandolin. it reacts quickly and is not over-sensitive. the way the mounting and dial articulate make it easy to set up while not interfering with the tuning knobs. easy to read and for the very low price a great value. however, and this may be my own fault, i often need to snap my finger against the dial to get it to start reading. i say my own fault because i put the battery in wrong the first time and had to pull it out with needlenose pliers. that may have damaged a contact. i play with a number of other people that have snarks and they all work properly. i would buy another one without hesitation. 4
this device is ok. it is light weight and folds nicely, but it is not especially stable. convenient storage is its biggest plus. 3
kripes man..the one time i go and actually buy a "honer" and its a "bummer" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! i can buy stuff 10 times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk. maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b4!...... all i can say is buy merana's for tryin out buy "suzuki" or swan" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a "mississipi river harp" for only  $5.oo if you have a "burke's" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the doctah has spoken! :) 1
this pedal work, although i find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup. my issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough. the m195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal, even running the delay on the output side of the m195. the noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup. i run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion. 4
i've got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years.this stuff cleaned most of them out pretty well but my midrange pot is starting to crackle again.i hate to tear the chassis out again but it'd gotta happen 3
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. using just one wall wart you can power all of them, at least those that receive this kind of power 9v. where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l6 converter 'cl6' for line 6 products. i have an m-audio black box which had a peculiar size plug. it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit. then i tried the l6 converter and bingo i'm in business and black box bliss. i would recommend having it around just for that. it costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can't find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters. a pedal junkies salvation. 5
in my house, i don't have to play quietly when rehearsing.... but when i really want to play along with a song and put some 'volume' to it, i can do it now without even a concern for our dogs, the neighbors, or my wife.  this device, as the product description tells you, allows you to plug it into your bass, plug your earbuds or headphones into it, set the volume and gain controls to suit, and play away in complete quiet to the rest of the world.  in addition, and this is the best part, there's a 1/8&#34; jack on this device that allows you to plug an mp3 player into it so you can play along with music of your choice.  i rehearse often with this thing.  you might think negatively about this device considering the fact that you can't control all the tone parameters like you can when rehearsing through your bass amp.  that's true.  but, the big thing is being able to use it for what it was designed for and all the ways it makes rehearsing simpler (less equipment-complicated) and quiet when necessary (lots of households have that need for quiet that don't always blend well with your rehearsal schedule, etc).  i paid $50 for it, and it works great,...worth the money for certain. 5
too much noise with one spot. this was way better.lot of feature.outlets 1&#8211;3 can all be used to power either 9v or 12v pedals. for each outlet, just use the voltage selector switches to choose the voltage you need, plug in your pedal and go!outlet 4 works the same way and gives you a similar choice &#8211; except that it&#8217;s between 9v and 18v.outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time. if you use them both at the same time, you might get some noise. like outlets 1&#8211;3, outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9v and 12v. outlet 6 is a 12v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power.6 isolated outputs delivering 300ma each (centre pin is negative) ac output at connector 6. will power all pedals.most of my pedals are 20 to 30 ma. so potentially i could have 40 plus pedals in a chain. awesomeall the cables you needlike all t-rex fuel tank power supplies, your new chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter-free. once you&#8217;ve selected your voltage options, just plug in and play!excellent!don't even think about it.just get it.highly recommend it 5
love the ukulele,  and the book is okay,, shows cords but the songs are very outdated,,  you tube is your friend when learning the uku...update : i got a tenor uku for xmas adn bought a concert uku just because, i love them both more than this little guy although it does travel with me and i just forked out money for a hardshell case so it wont get beat up as much in my suitcase by american airlines,( just ruined my suitcase)anyhow,  it has been going out of tune for awhile now ( c string fattest one)  and i just figured out my bridge is lifting, there are two rivets holding it down and there is a board inside although not a very thick one,,will be putting a new piece on the inside and some good wood glue under the bridge and let it dry,,,  if the bridge falls apart again, i will be smashing the box and making a banjo uku with the neck,,if you think you are really going to like playing, go for a concert or tenor,,  if you are liking the size spend a bit of money, this is pretty much the same as my grand daughters 20 dollar ebay ukulele i bought myself 4 years ago and gave to my 3 yo grand daughter because that one too would not stay in tune. 5
this is just the tuner i was looking for! it works on vibration or mic, so it's very versatile. it works on my acoustic, bass, electric, and my mother's voice. haven't tried the trumpet yet... intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see! 5
i already liked the jazz 3 picks by dunlop, these made from the ultex material sound so much better, and the surface of the pick is nice,even with sweaty fingers,they stay put. i do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick. sweet !!!!! these are clear yellow picks i would love to see them in red, that would be brutal!!!! 5
these tuners look and feel great. i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build. it was kind of a pain having to drill the 2 holes for the prongs on each tuner, but that is the way it is designed. they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break.the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar. 5
i've come to the point where anytime i buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves. they are good quality, decently priced, and i don't have to worry about them shorting out on me. definite buy. 5
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build. this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply. i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal. it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables. my board looks great, works well, and i love this power supply 5
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves!!! the heavy bottons 32, 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone. the others, 10, 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also. i don't rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci. when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection. the high strings were plenty of flakes. if fender solved that it would be perfect. 4
i purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin, she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin. 5
korg ga1 guitar and bass tuner is a very good and helpful tool to any guitar player.buy it, you will never regret. 5
this thing is awesome. it doesn't take up a lot of room and has a tone of options for connections....and it's way cheaper than a power box 5
this little music stand folds up small enough (after some disassembly) to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide. once assembled, it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books. the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you're standing, seated on a stool or in a chair. the angle of the tray is not adjustable. the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it, so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location. but for a portable stand, it's hard to find fault with this one, especially given the low cost. 5
this is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord... it's no peavey but it works just as good... 5
i really like the deluxe bags by fender.  plenty of space for stuff, good straps and carry options and enough padding to provide as much protection as a soft bag can. 5
if you haven't used this stuff, and if you plan to play 'squeak-less' guitar, take the risk. buy some.  you'll wonder how you ever played without it.  you might even become the next joe satriani! 5
i love these picks for playing my acoustic. they give such a nice, crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic. for me i prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric, probably a .70 or .80 but i still like the tortex picks for that as well. and these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply. 5
i have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars, banjos, and mandolins.they attach to the wall with 2 screws.  hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  it takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.very sturdy, well made product. 5
anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that i am not fond of the snark displays.  i prefer the "needle" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  however, that's me and ymmv, as they say on the internet.don't ask, then, why i got a sn-6.  i don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and i like to play with accessories.i am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  they all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.well, that's not *quite* true.  some models suffer fits in certain situations.  the rapid fall of the old intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low e string on a martin dreadnought.  a web search will reveal countless workarounds.  i (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.lately, i've become enamored of thekala ka-ubassfs solid mahogany u-bass - fretted.  if you want a tuning challenge, the low bass e string is it.  the sn-6 hardly hiccups.  other tuners seem to do "okay" but require a little coaxing.  not the sn-6! that's 5 stars in my book! 5
looks better than the expansive one my grandson has.  he keeps using mine!!!  arrived early and is of great quality.  fits my very old acoustic just right! 5
everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well.you have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after.the string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise.you wont be let down.dunlop makes good quality products. 5
high quality hassle free design.  very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  very happy with this purchase. 5
at &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag. it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying. these are also easily removed if they bother you. this epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics. 4
this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal.  i heard good things about the build quality, but didn't end up with a biyang until i needed a reverb pedal.  turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal.  most of the popular options or $100 and up.at around $59.99, the tri-reverb has a distinct advantage in price, but don't underestimate its quality.  as some other reviewers noted, the reverb can get extremely deep and lush, if you so desire.  i found myself with the "blend" and "time" knobs around 30% for a practical spring reverb.  there's a multi-switch for hall, spring, and room.  there are subtle differences between the three, but i'd be lying if i said they sounded dramatically different.  the a/b switch isn't well explained, but if you're in "a" mode, the effect is much more dramatic.  i found that operating in "b" mode was similar to the type of reverb i had enjoyed on my amps.  (note: it has a stereo input and output, but i only use one input/output, so i can't comment on that).at the end of the day, it's a fairly simple "always-on" effect, and the biyang does the job without costing a fortune.  but what makes it 5-star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality.  having a thumb mini-screw to open the 9v compartment (instead of a plastic door or needing a phillips screwdriver) is a big deal.  also love that the 9v jack is on the top of the unit, away from the other jacks.  the pots are smooth and easy to turn, and the mini-switches and footswitch are "boutique" level quality.  this is a great reverb pedal - i don't think i'll ever need another one. 5
these work better than anything else i ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording, think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well. 5
bought these for my son's electric guitar.  he loves this brand!  they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands.  price is great! 5
this has a nice smell, and is good for maintaining the wood on the neck of your guitar. best used when replacing strings, so you can apply while the strings are off. 5
it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price.....works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten...the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights....i really wanted to use it halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn't want it out on the porch.....next year! 5
i bought this guitar in 2005.  it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way.  i think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value.this model has the cedar top.  i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars.  it is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that.  if you prefer the bright concert sound of a martin then you'll not want this cedar top.yes this guitar has an oiled finish.  this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded.  it also allows you to knock the heck out of it.  funny thing is that after five years there isn't much damage just a little arm wear.  i think you'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around.the neck feels silky smooth.  the frets are well placed and don't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you'll get in other guitars in this price range.  paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing.this doesn't come with a case so i bought a hard shell by the brand name "canadian".  great case.when i bought it it really didn't need an adjustment but i took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me.  i've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished.  i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago.  performing these tasks will prolong the life of your seagull and your enjoyment of it.--------------------update: 10/13/2012 update of my 2010 review.  this guitar sounds even better.  i went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic "just for fun" and i had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket.  to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior.  you see i learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will "open up" and keep sounding better.  yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of.  it will increase in value (to you at least). 5
my classical guitar stand was metal and short, like this, but did not have the front brace or download slant. if i had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it's headstock on the hard flood. so sad. i mourn it still. 5
works just as it should, love it and a great price to boot 4
not bla bla bla, this joyo pedals are the best, any you get. that's it! thank u joyo im your number 1 customer. 5
buy this. it's cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much. it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard.....amazing sounds! 5
it's about the size of a credit card, and half as thick as a deck of cards.  it's fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it's supposed to do.  you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable.  it has a switch to change between bass and guitar, and it accounts for the extra strings on 5 string basses or 7 string guitars.it also has a button to tune it down lower (5 half steps) so you can do some alternate tunings too.lastly it has a button for &#34;sound&#34; so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually.  the display is very fine and kinda hard to read, but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it's flat, in tune or sharp, so you can focus on that if you have trouble.it comes with 2 aaa batteries.  i have no idea how long they'll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later. 5
this tuner is very accurate.  it is well made and stays on without falling off.  i tested it with other tuners and it's right on. easy to see when positioned correctly. 5
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with.  for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings.  i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right.  i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings.  i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings. 2
i&#8217;ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use. very secure. the best i&#8217;ve used so far. 5
the winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so i don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  i actually like my dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but i guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so i won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon. 4
if you want u2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound. thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob. for the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget. 4
these balanced patch cables are great.  this is the third set of various music cables i've purchased from this brand and they are all great quality for the price.  love their xlr microphone cables too. 5
i am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and i am glad i did, i am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and i have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick, its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement, i stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when i drop my pick i just flick a new one out and continue on. 5
first off, i'm no ukulele expert. that being said: i replaced the original strings on my newmahalo u-35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pinkwith these. i know they stated concert, however, reading up on this, they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings. like another reviewer said, it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke, but it sure helped out a lot. the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. i'm loving the sound. also, i really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  i would definitely recommend these. 4
this is a great basic mic stand for live and studio use, although i don't suggest using this and playing guitar. great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments. it does not come with a mic clip, so you'll need to get one. it's a great deal, buy it! 5
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and it's awesome. real cost saver on batteries. you really cant go wrong for the price. 5
great strap, durable and good lookin. it works great for me, i like this type of strap's, simple & durable. try one. 5
i have tried several different kinds of guitar tuners and of the ones i have tried the snark is the best. it is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier. i highly recommend this tuner. 5
this tremolo arm needed to be bent outwards a bit in order for it screw down enough while still clearing the volume and tone controls, overall a pretty good purchase 4
you don't really need an expensive sustain pedal unless you're a concert pianist playing on a $10k keyboard- nuff said. 5
well behringer!!!,, have to say that the electronics are german mind,, with all that says ,, go figure it out for yourself,, other then that !!.. plastic so i give 4 stars, cuz of the soft plastic case, and the trouble of changing batteries,, but u can use the charger and u will be well off.. sound is really awesome for the money , and it is high standard delay time and sound,, i don't think u can get the german quality anywhere else for 30 bucks,, i say buy it it is a great delay pedal,, and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money,, can not go wrong.. 4
this is a solid little usb interface.  there are no frills, and there's no latency.  i have used this for @ 4 years without any problems, and it's very portable.  i run this between my small, 8 channel mixer and my laptop for recording guitar, and it's well worth the price to have one of these around.  can also be used with tape players to import audio into your computer; i use this for more than just guitar recording. 5
replaced a stock fender speaker in a modified mustang lead ii cabinet that i now use connected to a hughes and kettner amp.  this speaker dramatically improved the sound of the cabinet, and sounded good using the mustang ii amp as well.  this speaker seems to take some of the sizzle and shrill off the high-end to make a nice even sound.  i'm quite pleased with this speaker. 5
when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion. but when i got it and played with it i figured out it was alot different that advertised. it is a acdc, steve vaughn kind of pedal. it's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. it's truly a one of a kind product. i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. make a note it is not a metal pedal. not by any means actually. but for what it is it is fantastic. 5
i've been playing guitar for years and personally i would prefer cleartone or elixir strings. i bought these for my little sister and she loves them. they have a really nice sound to them. i feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these. 4
what can you say... at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! i was looking for a very inexpensive version of the popular sansamp, and this does it for me.  decent svt, flip top or "fat tube" tone, and a nice quiet di.  i go di to the house, and the output into my old seymour duncan amp/aguilar gs410 cab. great tone!! i'm using a 9vdc class ii wall wart (found it in my "spare parts" closet) vs 9v batteries.  with the wall wart, no di hum = great! does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply. never use the foot switch; if used at all, i use my finger.  if broken or lost(who would steal it?), i'd buy another in a heart beat! 4
grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones. normally i used the old fender medium or heavy picks, but i gotta say these are great. stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great. 5
needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer.  it is limited in what it can do but it does the job.  i'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan.  the three points mentioned in another rating (inputs should be out the back, needs rubber feet, and the led) are spot on.  i'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well.  it could also use being a tad bigger, they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together.  the led for the power on this thing is so bright it's obnoxious, it almost blinds you.  other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise... 4
very good strap, but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely. especially when you take off the guitar for a break. either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is needed 5
i've had behringer mikes before, and currently have a couple of xm2000s, which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm 58s. i saw this three pack of 1800s for $40 in a hard case and couldn't believe it. i hooked them up right beside the 2000s, and while there is a little difference, it's not much. the 1800 has a little more high end, but it's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass. the presence is also boosted a little on the 1800, meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback.for now, i'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists, and keeping the older 2000s as backups.i bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one sm 58. although the shure (and the b 2000) is better, the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for. i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup.a wise choice for the budget conscious. 4
holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar 5
there's not much to say about this pick. i like medium picks and this feels comfortable.they wear a bit faster than i would expect, but far rom being a problem. it may just be my style.the 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity. 5
excellent sound quality.very functional and easy to work with.small enough to take along.it is my most used gear in my life right now. i don't want anything else. 5
for an $8 item, you can't go wrong. i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center. it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone. 5
i thought it was a good deal when i saw the original price, the discount stated it was $8 off. instead it was only $2 cheaper than buying at my local music store. other than the price, the strings work great on my guitar. sounds amazing. i'll definitely be buying more of these. 5
great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the p's, i don't know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue 4
this harmonica is great for beginners, or professionals. i know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones. highly recommended. plays, sounds, feels and looks great. also comes with a little note sheet 5
very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it!!!!!! i would recommend this product to a friend! 5
if you're looking for the perfect patch cables for your effects board, these are it. very well-manufactured, durable, and reliable, i'll use these again and again 4
perfect to try different sizes and shapes!! great quality. buy it if you don't know which size or shape will work best for you. 5
classic fender heavy picks.  i love the fender heavy pick and now my picks,knobs and inlays are all shiny abalone 5
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session. a guitar is an investment and you should protect it. a good polish cloth is a must. 5
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all.  it's comfortable and sturdy.  what else could you want in a guitar strap? 5
the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for. 3
for any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.i didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.that being said, it is good for practice and song writing. used this for more than a year and finally sold it! that's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out. 2
this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand.  of course one might think that would translate into sturdy, and one would be correct.  super simple to use.  no buttons, levers, or knobs. just pop it open.  it doesn't have an actual mechanical locking feature, but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place.  it holds my acoustic securely, and i have no fear that it's going to tip over on its own.  when you're done, just nudge the outer legs to "unlock" them and it's super easy to fold back up.i had a fender mini acoustic stand, but it didn't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so i figured i would try this one.  i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter.  however..... i can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2.75" thickness.  if hercules could have figured a way to avoid that, this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine.  it's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag, but i think the marketing guys used a little creative license with that description.  (either that or they're comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue.) still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed. 4
before we get started, i am more "pro" than amateur. i work at a church as a pastor of worship arts and use this in my work. but i hesitate to say i'm only "pro", because "amateur" means you do something purely for the love of it... and i feel that way about music... so...first... the models i've tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers i've used, which includes logic studio's amps (these sound almost as good btw), pod x3live and xtpro (the hd models are noticeably better... and the fizz is gone gone gone), the original pod and 2.0 (which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time), and the tonelab se (which i missed for a while, but not anymore).i made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a bassman 4x10 alongside the dr. z, and it is the coolest sound i've ever made with this guitar... easily. better sounding, to my ears, than the real amps i've been using (maybe because i put them off stage and don't run them very loud). i adore the sound of this unit.oh, and as always... forget about all the pre-sets. they're probably all as useless as you imagine they might be.now the bad news. and it's significant... for some...first off, editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x3live. just forget about trying to use the display. connect to a computer... seriously. when you start from an init patch, you only get lucky, it seems, to manage to coax it into "two amp" config...next, the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it's specs. you will almost certainly not be able to do 8 fx at once the way you're thinking. why? let's say you use an xt or a x3. think about what you're used to.you start with 8 fxsubtract effect banks for...1. volume pedal (you need to use an effect bank). you might be able to use an analog pedal, but i like my volume after my compressor... so i have to do it in the loop i guess...2. fx loop (only works with an effect bank... line6, is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade? seems like you could.)3. noise gate (used to be always available... don't worry if you mix this with the m13 as i plan to do, though, as the m13 has a great gate). i mostly use clean or just barely broken-up amps, so i might be able to skip this.4. wah (this is always available and active in the x3 and below).5. post-eq. the x3live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot. in addition to all the other fx, too. you need to dedicate an fx bank now.so... you might only have 3fx left. for me, put in a clean boost and tube drive (which i think sound better in this box than they did in the m13. probably because they're "digitally part of the signal" is all i can think) and a verb for the amp. no slots left. what if you need delay and modulation? eek! i have to re-think the way i use fx in this box. still evaluating how that will work for me.what if you're a guy like me who was using the x3live (occasionally) as a one-box solution for a dual-voice guitar. (all my guitars have piezo bridges.) no dice.i will have to use an acoustic preamp. no matter. i have one. i will probably dedicate a "null" amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it.in addition, there aren't as many computer-recording routing options as the x3live, and the super-sweet ability to switch between two fx chains in one patch (instead of switching programs) is gone. as far back as my old vox tonelab se, i could literally switch channels from one amp/cab to another in the same fx chain. you could do something similar on the x3live. not here. also... line 6, why on earth can't you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interface with this unit? how complicated can that really be?in short... the x3live has significantly... significantly more flexibility imho than this unit, for many of us at least, and ought not to have been discontinued imho. for some of you, it's still a viable option.you also still might need your other fx!i thought it might be possible that this unit, even if i needed to use my ag stomp for my acoustic side again (which i'm happy to do) would bump my m13 off the stage. it did not at first, but after a while, i did indeed get rid of the m13, and don't miss it.. that said, i think from what i'm hearing that some of the fx (especially the dirt pedals) work far better inside this box than they do in the m13 when you connect it to a pod or amp.my favorite patches so far that i've made (which use the bassman model and the unbelievable dr. z model... far and away my favorite amp model evah!) don't leave any room for modulation or other special fx. (i'm not a "switch whole patches on the fly" guy. i turn fx off and on.) but after a bit of tweaking and patch-making, i discovered that for my sounds, i didn't need dual amp chains that often, so i have all my flexibility back...so am i complaining about these limitations? no. because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary. i'd take off a full star for this shortcoming, but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that i can't do it.there will, at some point, i hope, be a next-generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings, but i have to say, for this price, i am totally satisfied with the sound!in the meantime, am i willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one? heck yes, it sounds that good. i even love the models of amps i know i'll never use for the first time ever.... and after a few months of experimenting, i was able to make patches that completely worked for my two-voice guitar stuff... with no additional outboard gear if i didn't want. so i've simplified to where i wanted to, and no longer feel like i'm really compromising anything.so... started with a rig consisting of the hd500, and sometimes an m13, and an acoustic preamp (currently a yamaha ag-stomp) mixed in with the hd signal through the aux input. i've now gotten to the point where i can do everything i want, if i need, without the additional pedals, and i sold the m13. i kept a few analog pedals and such that i just like, but rarely take them out of the house anymore.i'm only nit-picking so that you will know all the trade-offs. for what i have been fantasizing about, basically an m13 in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box, this is as close as we're probably going to come. and, did i mention... the sound! it's seriously great!update! i have learned that i will indeed have no problem replacing my m13 as well, and sold it off. i thought i'd miss it, but i don't.update! as of february 2012, i have supplemented this product with a black james tyler variax jtv59 (korean), and it's a marriage made in heaven! if you are going to go with this product, and if you are looking for a new guitar, check out the new variaxes. totally amazing. 5
works great, sounds great, it's a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate. tascam rocks. 5
i hated having to put the pick between strings.  and now that i have a ton of picks, i can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish, and i dont want to ruin it.  but the instructions say it should be fine.  i think i might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well, still deciding on that.  but for the price you pay for this, it's a no brainer for any musician. 5
i have these on 5 of my guitars now, with my acoustic and a &#34;novelty&#34; guitar being the exceptions. i can't stand the thought of not using these after seeing too many expensive guitars hit the floor after the straps let loose. other styles have a button, which seems more convenient, but the schaller locks are pull style which is far more secure if something bumps the end of the lock. these are the only locks i'll use now. 5
ukulele straps are a rare thing and i've yet to find the perfect one.  this one gets close.  not all uke players use straps, some do and some don't.  purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced.  however i have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use.  i've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing.  a preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar.  this neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less.there is another device called a uke leash that also works well.  it ties onto the headstock. i like this neotech better because even though the instrument isn't balanced perfectly, it is balanced better than with the uke leash.  the uke leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the neotech simple sling.this neotech simple sling soundhole clip strap works on my concert and tenor ukes equally well, but i have to adjust it some when switching it between the two.the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument.  i don't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached.  this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments.you have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument.  the clip on the neotech sling is wider than most i've seen and this extra width reduces, but does not completely eliminate, that risk. the wider clip spreads the stress out.  i've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and i'm afraid to try them on a ukulele.  i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it.the uke leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place, so i like this neotech soundhole clip device better.the only thing i don't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap.  but once on it is great!  you look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can't do it with a hat on.  it gets easier the more you do it.i'd buy the neotech simple sling again.  i recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes.  just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on. 4
indeed, this little blue-lighted wonder will make you famous. not unlike the &#34;three wolf moon&#34; shirt, this little pedal will get you the ladies (or if you're a lady, it will likely get you the guys). either way, it gets you what you want! on top of that, it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of &#34;oomph&#34;. in particular, i find it helpful when i'm running a lower output guitar through a long cable. did i mention it has a blue light? the only downside is that you have to open up the back (with a screwdriver, so put that on your shopping list if you don't have one) to adjust the little switches that chance the tone. 4
i really like this strap, it's comfortable, adjusts easily, and the pick holder is really convenient.  this is my second one for my other guitar. 5
the elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brand-new 'sound' a lot longer than any other brand.  i am very happy with the elixir brand strings. 5
i purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore.  it was brand new, unopened, in box.  they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. in that environment i thought it a nice instrument.however, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was very busy and noisy.  it's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.this is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  it measures a bit over 28" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  the advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  it's tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe.  one cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until i got it home and read the instructions.  so my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  it takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  so all is not lost there.  it was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because i didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that i impulse buy).so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  that's where the yamaha really falls short.  this is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  that this was a "rush job" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.there are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).the action is of course too high.  that's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.however, the thing that bothers me the most:  if i wasn't aware this is a yamaha guitalele... i'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  there's not one thing about this instrument that says "quality"-- which is quite disappointing.  this instrument sells for about $100.  that low cost is obvious.  this is a "cheap guitar" in every way.  i can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks "beginner instrument".  the tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. the finish is-- unfinished.i bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on amazon-- and i respect those reviews.  people have different tastes and for some folks this has a "home made" feel that they will love.  however i've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap.  i own two ovation guitars, a peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. and no i'm not hawking epiphone.  facts is facts, that's all.  you can read my very-positive review on the epiphone on amazon).when i got this  home and took a good look at it, i found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than "this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible".  in truth the only positive thing i have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  the only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  other than its portability, i find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).one must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  but low quality is low quality.(edit two weeks later:  i just today saw the cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  the cordoba is much nicer.  it's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  sorry yamaha, but facts is facts.  had i seen the cordoba and yamaha side by side, i'd have bought and kept the cordoba.)that's my honest review.  i know some will disagree.  but others know exactly what i mean.  this isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. however-- i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  as mentioned, the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it.  i simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are. 2
i have about 4 different types of tuners and this is the best of them all. i have small kids and birds around the house so many tuners get lost with the noise. this one works off the vibration of the guitar so it is right every time even with a lot of noise around. 5
i've just got the shure sm58 microphone.as expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product.also, i've bought it at amazon and they sold through j&r; music and computer world which is an excellent supplier. they shipped in less time than expected.i'm a really happy customer now. 5
it is sturdy, well made, feels hefty in your hands, with an extremely smooth action - everything the shubb winder is not.well, it is made in china, while the shubb is made in usa. but what is the point if it is so much inferior?i think it proves that it is not about where it is made but how it is designed and manufactured. 5
it's a very cute little capo. it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small. but it works. 5
is this guraunteed for life or something?  it should be for the price.  it is very basic, tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up.  i would not buy another one at the prices they charge, but then, i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to.  the carry bag is very nice, the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff.  they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it, they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between.  if you look at the picture there appears to room for 6 pedals but 5 is all you will get.  i have a boss rx-20 double pedal looper, and 2 other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables. 3
this tuner works great, easy to attach, turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string, is as easy as one two three. 5
there are so many reviews of this little jewel, i won't bother going into details but it's everything i could have hoped for and more. the sound quality is amazing and it's very easy to use. i'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck. i take it everywhere and it has never let me down. i had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that are included, i have no complaints. 5
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended 5
i love this it's do fun to play with. every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me. they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price. i'm sold out on joyo pedals. 5
very sturdy stand suitable for stage use. this stand even accommodates a double neck. its not very compact when folded but i'm still giving it 5 stars. 5
the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard.  what i like most is that the padded arm is thin and keeps out of the way of your playing.  highly recommended! 5
good bottom, the stainless give's you a nice treble,there's still a good flatwound sound, i use roundwound on my other basses but it was nice to come back. 5
i might have done something wrong...i read in a review that these hold six picks.it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...i'll just keep using my pockets. 1
these perform well on single coils, specifically telecasters.  right now i switch back and forth between power and beefy, with fenders being my next choice followed by d'addario. 4
these strings are great for a 12 string. i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel. a 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have. they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar. and i think they will last longer. which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring! 5
this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website.  technical support is also almost zero.  akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products.  customer service is basically "if you have to ask, you should not buy this".  i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store!  this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don't buy this product.  try finding a midi tutorial that is usable.  good luck with that chore.added 08nov2010: the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing.  i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts.  i find that unbelievable. 1
changed the strings on my epiphone eb-0 bass today for the first time using this product.fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare.  cutter works great, winder makes the job really fast.  10 minutes it took for all 4 strings.  next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing.  highly recommended 5
i got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. that is a record. the tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. it is the sound that i like though. 5
stringed instruments are best hung vertically, which this stand accomplishes beautifully.  constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment. 5
i've never really owned a fuzz pedal before, but have tried a few. out of most i've tried, i've come across the big muff the most. it didn't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently. even my boss hyper metal hm-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks, but it isn't 100% there, certainly.my budget being what is it right now, i didn't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal. there are loads of fuzzes available for $100 or less, but this model is essentially three pedals in one. that's what attracted me to it, along with a few reviews in youtube. not to mention the bargain basement price.the three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal. the two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless.fuzz 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound. it doesn't get too bright, until the treble knob is pushed past 3 o' clock. this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick. with humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock. i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay. it seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes. if you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible.fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff. it has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister. with the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here. this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1, so it buzzes longer. this makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy. (head era korn comes to mind for me...)the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile. boost. this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level. it actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the eq and gain knobs all the way up. the resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked). still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, boost does a good job of staying clean. this would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound. it might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.overall, i like the tones this pedal spits out. i've only had it a few hours, but i love what i'm hearing so far. the build is similar to the other behringer pedals i have, a nr100 noise reducer, and a to800, their overdrive that sounds like a tube screamer. with this more recent pedal (built on june of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before. i'd still not abuse them too much, though. as always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank).you can't go wrong with the bright blue led, either! makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color. 4
works smoothly, built like a tank and looks good as well. i've tried other passive volume pedals that didn't work...this one works. worth every penny. 5
i purchased these cables for my behringer 802 mixer & mxl 770 mic and these cables are perfect! finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing i have the professional cables to back me up! the best xlr cables you can find. hands down. 5
this is a super easy to use pedal. you just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset. don't worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound. if you really want to be able to tweak everything, then get the mxr analog chorus instead. it has about six knobs. i like the ease of use on this one, and i omly use chorus sparingly. another cool feature of mxr pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it. it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot. 5
i recently purchased a used american fender strat that came with the old tweed case...nice case, but doesn't provide the protection that i need for my guitars. the fender/skb case is built like a tank and provides great protection and it has tsa locks for when you travel. a no-brainer for fender guitars. 4
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board. the flexibility is awesome, you can wind it underneath and around the pedal board and still plug it in to the pedals with out straining. 5
when i got this i thought it was a cheap toy-like thing, but when i put it on my banjo, it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else, but easy to see when i needed it.  it's red when out of tune and green when in tune.  it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned.  i love it when i am the only one using it.  unlike the clamp kind, like the snark, it's hard to share.  the clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to, so between my husband and me using it, i'm afraid the thing will break.  i play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head, but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it. 5
we've been using remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from classic rock to speed metal.great quality, very durable.you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed. 5
these things are terrible. one wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this. 1
i ordered this bench for last christmas (2005). i'm satisfied so far. good value for money.the seat is generously padded and is 2.5 inches thick. padding material is not too soft, and that is good in my opinion.all-steel frame construction feels sturdy.contrary to one of the reviews, my bench came with height adjustment (it is not on-the-fly kind of thing, though). each of the legs has 3 holes (low, middle, high). a fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs, and the bolt becomes the crossing point of "x". three positions roughly correspond to 18, 19 and 20 inches.for changing height, all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt, insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it. don't worry, you don't need any tool to do the job,  thanks to a large plastic knob. see the picture and you'll understand how it works.mine initially came with middle position. i also tried high and low, but set it back to middle. it seems to be a good compromise for my family, as the bench is used daily by me, my wife and my kids. sure it's nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily. however, with this price, i wouldn't complain at all. 5
this isn't a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges (usually for a whammy bar) and not using these heavier strings already.i wanted a little fuller sound than the 10-46 slinky strings (aka regular slinky) and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefy's. i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar. every time i got the higher strings in tune, the lowers would go down as much as a half note. it took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as i tightened the strings. so i pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws. i made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress. the final time i tightened them down, the high e string broke. since these were my only beefy's, my day was done with these strings. however, given how far i tightened the tension screws, i think i would have had to purchase an additional tension spring (not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge flush with the body.as i said, this isn't a knock of these strings. i never really got a chance to play them. just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings. it can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a 45 degree angle to your guitar and if you aren't careful, you can damage your guitar. 4
i brought for someone else. but they said they love it. so i am a happy camper i did it right. 5
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both. the h4n is a great versatile field recorder. i mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. the h4n is a work horse. it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. i highly recommend purchasing a "furry head" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.unlike the h1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the h4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. however, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. i had this happen once. if this happens to you, don't worry. i searched the internet and was able to find several zoom certified service centers within my general area. i called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the h4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; i didn't pay a dime. i had it shipped off and back in 7 days.all in all the h4n is a great field recorder. i mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two xlr inputs at the same time. in some cases i also use a small 4 channel behringer field mixer if i have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly.i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n. as i said earlier, purchase a "furry head" wind screen. i use the furry head wind screens every time i record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. i only use 32gb sandisk sd cards because sandisk is dependable, i have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. i record at 48k @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. this allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case i forget to transfer the audio files along with video when i edit. i also suggest having a di box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. i have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a di box from venue mixers. this has to do with a balance and padding that i am just not going to get into but trust me, a di box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. i also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. always be prepared. i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues. battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.i do not regret this purchase at all. the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. i highly recommend purchasing one. 5
winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well  you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well. 5
these strings are best suited for strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. they're also quite good on les paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. my issue with them is that the b string and the a string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. i would prefer if the b string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the a were 0.032 instead of 0.034. as such, i prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. but if you're not too picky, this will suit you very well. 4
capos are not something that i shop for. i have had two for years. one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type. it is similar to this one. yeah...in looks only. this one blows that one away. it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner. it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways. this is great. i play a tele and an acoustic martin. it works great on both. i play professionaly and this is the best thing i've gotten in two years. 5
not your average giant clumsy guitar stand, but it works. the only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support. if you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs, or even fairly large cats, a larger stand might be a better choice. if your household is quiet, this is very much a good bargain. 4
about ten years ago, i installed strap locks on my first guitar (fender stratocaster). they worked well and were easy to install. i subsequently installed dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. i had to drill additional holes no two guitars (gibson sgs).  ouch.this made me take a second look at schaller. the components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than dunlop. it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice.  i should have gone with schaller from the beginning. i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results. 5
the on stage xcg4 tubular guitar stand is a decent quality simple guitar stand like almost all the others, so here is how i rated it. there are really high quality stand of the same design, but i will not use those stands as a comparison.  seriously, the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt.  if you somehow made one that retails for over $30 and are able to sell it, i applaud your marketing team.continuing on, this is how i rated the on stage xcg4:if it were over $13, it would have gotten 3 stars.between $7 and $13, earns it 4 stars.if it were under $7, it would have gotten 5 stars.i hope this helps,~jp.s.  the currency is in us dollars.  please adjust accordingly. 4
i does the job that i wanted it for. just to keep picks in my guitar case. it's okay but it could be better. 3
being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the snark sn 1, i purchased this bargain priced tuner, i could not be more pleased. it has settings for chromatic, bass, guitar, and ukulele. not only does it have tone dial indicator, but the screen changes color, red for flat, green for just right, yellow for sharp. the screen is also very bright and easy to read. it is very sensitive, no need to constantly move it around like with the snark sn 1. it is tiny, perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse. i use mine for when i go to the music store and test out ukuleles. this makes a perfect main tuner, or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners. my main tuner is a snark sn 8, but this one is just as accurate. the only negatives i can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate, so you don't want to force it, and the power button is very tiny, but for the size and performance of the unit, those low points are almost irrelevant. buy a couple, you can get two or three of these for the price of a single snark or korg. 5
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine.  does not leave streaks if used properly.  this dries quickly every time. 5
with drum pads, i basically either get 0 velocity, or max.  and i have to really hammer on them to trigger.  hurts after a while.likes:+ size+ assignable knobs.+ works good w/ ableton livedislikes:- drum pads!keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size.i'm looking to upgrade after a month.. want better drum pads.  :-/ 2
watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the yeti microphone.  works like a champ, gets rid of all those unwanted noises!  larger than i expected. 5
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. generously, i'll give it 2stars. something like this really should last at least a year or more. cheap parts/manufacturing?  50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature. 2
i was not happy with the sound of these strings. the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny. for an extra $2 i bought the d'addario ej45 pro arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old yamaha g-60.  spend the extra $2 its well worth it. 2
i did not care for the tone or feel. took them off within an hour and put back on ej16. they had a rough feel and were stiff. lots of folks like them but not for me. 3
i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. the sound i get from the ad&g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. the strings seem to hold up well. i cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. these strings sound great, i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing. 5
nice bright and full sound. good life, they sound good for a couple of months. inexpensive. fast delivery. i am happy with this product. 5
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item. if it doesn't work, you hate it. if it works, there's nothing impressive about a stand, so i just like it. 4
manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar. i have an esp eclipse. not even close. chromacast products are great. they need to fix the info on their web page. i'm not a fan of shaped les paul cases. too bad. 1
a year ago, i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r-09 wave/mp3 recorder, blackand thezoom h4 handy recorder + 2gb accessory kit(pre-accessory kit).  i wanted a high quality, easy to use recorder, so even though the h4 had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less, i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use.zoom has responded with the h2, a scaled down version of the h4 with all of the features of the r-09 and all of the controls right where you need them.  the h2 even has additional features over the r-09, but they don't get in the way.  for example, there's a choice of a 90 degree recording pattern, a 120 degree recording pattern, and even a surround sound option. samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website.one big complaint i've had with the edirol is the cost of its add-on stand.  unlike the edirol, the h2 comes with a simple stand.  in addition, the h2 has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod!  on a separate note, it's much easier to replace batteries with the h2 than the edirol.recently, i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r-09 and the zoom h2.  i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks (that is, equalize their loudness).  the first time we played them back, i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol, with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units.  the second time we played them back, my preference was for the h2, with overall opinion continuing to be split.  we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all.i do prefer the edirol's control buttons to the h2's membrane and i'm not about to sell the edirol, perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and don't want to give it up just yet. also, the edirol r-09 is the darling of the moment.  however, if i owned neither, i couldn't justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h2 and would opt for the h2. when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i'd need only one recorder, i grabbed the h2. 5
to be honest i'm not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion. i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix, one of the best names in the business. and for the fact it was cheaper than most. i'm very pleased with the pedal and couldn't be happier. 5
this particular brand i've seen around and haven't heard to much about them, but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days. it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one.and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they send another one in exchange, that didn't work out so well, with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one, i'd have to rate this one at the bottom... 2
i got this several years ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by it, really was nice with my acoustic to raise some volume on my soundhole pickup before the direct box. i gave it to some one after i used it for a couple of years. 4
what can i say about a guitar strap.  it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price. 4
i had an issue with my new squire guitar, and fender hooked me up with a set of these.  the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end, rather then the typical small loop.  the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity.  i say they sound great and are worth trying.  i just order 3-packs so i can have some on hand. 5
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass.  applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets, wipes right up.  a must to keep wood looking fresh. 5
great all round pick, one of my favorites.  easy to grip and are pretty quite.  they wear out extremely fast though. 5
i got this for christmas last year ,as a beginner learning guitar ,this is a must have , works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadn't had to replace the battery's yet,, and i tune my guitar every time i play,  well worth it,, its so easy to use, 5
i had previously owned it digitech jam man, i also try the boss.after seeing demos of this item on youtube i decided  i'll give it a try, i can always return it if i didn't like it.the unit is extremely small but don't let that fool you. this unit is a high-quality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly. you get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs. let's be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes?the unit is transparent when turned off i would highly recommend this looper it's well worth the money. 5
this capo will do the job, if you can squeeze it open.  i'm hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension. it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar.  i cannot do it with one hand. 3
made of quality material. i do not need anything fancy,because i am a simle person! it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar! 5
i have been using this pre-amp for a year and it has been great.  after i figured out that you have to attach a ground cable to the record player it installed very easily just plug it in and it plays!  i have not noticed any excess heat or other problems even though i keep it inside of my closed entertainment stand. 5
shipped in time. just what i have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. easy to screw it on the wall. 5
i've had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap, durable, and reasonably accurate.  i own several different tuners and what i like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar.  batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it.  at ten dollars, i think it's a no-brainer.  it's the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own. 5
these strings fit the bill perfectly for "my" desired sound from a yamaha lj-16 acoustic guitar which has been "doctored" with bone saddle, pins and nut. when i decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the elixir strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that i like so much in the lj-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. i did move to the medium for a little improvement from the bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that i've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............these are great!!!! 5
great deal on a capo, it's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere.  it takes a while for the shipping, but that's stated in the description.  i was pleasantly suprised.  i would recommend this capo. 5
have not used the light as much as i thought i might, but it works okay. each light has multiple, independent settings. the beams are narrow, but you get two of them.the major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag. something in the bag will trigger the switch, and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it. there is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transport.also, you cannot really tell from the product picture, but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects. it does not work well (or at all) with object more than 1/4 inch thick. 3
good strings 5
have always liked  ernie ball products,so i thought i would like to try their strings,to see how they work,i am very pleased ! 5
the best buy for your bass drum 5
although i purchased a lanikai lu-21 ukulele some time ago, i have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours.  despite that, i've been highly impressed with its quality and sound.  as some reviewers note, nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp; however, that's more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele.  the lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard, although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general, it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range.  the tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well.  if i were going to be playing gigs, i'd probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument (and i probably would not purchase it without trying it first), but for having some fun, this is a workable and recommended instrument. 4
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds-1 . great chrunch for the buck from classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in. 5
this is an absolute must-have item for any gigging drummer! holds your drink, just like it says it will. what more can you ask for out of a drink holder? no more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy (at least not unintentionally). pro. 5
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone. it is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place. 5
fretted maple fender(r) telecaster(tm)-style neck with truss rod this is one of many fender necks i have purchased from this company i have built several telecasters and fender p bass and stratocaster bodies all so far have been great to play the quality in the wood is great. i have purchased womack&#8217;s in the past granted there superb necks but there price is way over the top. when i must replace a neck i think for the money this isa great way to go johnj 5
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place. easy to reach and nice to have on hand. 5
by far the best distortion pedal out there. no doubt about that. several of my friends use this pedal, and they all love it. i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal. it's great for medal. it have a nice punch to it along with a great &#34;cut&#34; so you're palm mutes don't blend into each other like other pedals. there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations. amazing 5
d'addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price.  their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and i have yet to find a better buy. 5
not very substantial. it began to tear on my guitar strings. i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses. 2
eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion, worked perfectly out of the box, and has been used several times to record choirs and piano. the sound is clear and well-balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around 10 feet. 5
i have found that everything schaller make's is grade a-#1 in my book. made in germany ( not china ) these locks are fast and secure. i like the way they slide on & off which if your like me having to change guitar's during a show or just at home, the change is smooth and safe. no dropping guitar's around here !!! i have them on all my guitar's. 5
perfect for my guitars. sounds great for my telecaster and my stratocaster guitars. capacitor are a nice generalized  choice. excellent choice. 5
this my second hosa guitar cable.  (the other one is shorter.)  like my first hosa cable, this is a high quality item.  i'd definitely buy more cables of this brand. 4
